MIDI can be employed to listen or input into the analysis program that only requires the basic music description of music score. The MIDI file itself does not contain waveform data, so the file is very small. The pretty_midi Python toolkit contains practical functions/classes for parsing, modifying and processing MIDI data, through which users can easily read various note information contained in MIDI.   Music21 is an object-oriented toolkit for analyzing, searching and converting music in symbolic form. J. S. Bach four-part chorus dataset can be directly obtained from music21 Python package, which contains 402 choruses. The four parts in the dataset are soprano, alto, tenor and bass. However, this data set is very small and lacks expressive information.   Ferreira et al. created a new music dataset VGMIDI with sentiment notation in symbolic format, which contains 95 MIDI labelled piano pieces (966 phrases of 4 bars) from video game soundtracks and 728 non-labelled pieces, all of them vary in length from 26 seconds to 3 minutes. MIDI labelled music pieces is annotated by 30 human subjects according to a valence-arousal (dimensional) model of emotion. The sentiment of each piece is then extracted by summarizing the 30 annotations and mapping the valence axis to sentiment. For the concrete operation of emotion annotation extraction, please refer to literature .   The Lakh MIDI Dataset (LMD) is the largest symbolic music corpus to date, including 176,581 unique MIDI files created by Colin Raffel, of which 45,129 files have been matched and aligned with the items in the Million Song Dataset (MSD) BIBREF356 . However, the dataset has unlimited polyphonic, inconsistent expressive characteristics and contains various genres, instruments and time periods. LMD includes the following formats: 1) 176,581 MIDI files with duplicate data removed, and each file is named according to its MD5 checksum (called \u201cLMD full\"); 2) subset of 45,129 files (called \u201cLMD matched\") that match items in the MSD; 3) All LMD-matched files are aligned with the 7Digital preview MP3s in the MSD (called \u201cLMD aligned\").  5pt |m50pt|m80pt|m27pt|m30pt|m27pt|m55pt|m120pt|m110pt|  Dataset summary 2* Format 2* Name 3c| Modality 2*   2* Size 2* Access   Score   Audio  8rContinued table 2 2* Format 2* Name 3c| Modality 2*   2* Size 2* Access   Score   Audio  10*MIDI JSB Chorus Polyphonic 402 Bach four parts chorus Music21toolkit BIBREF312   VGMIDI Polyphonic with sentiment 823 piano video game soundtracks Derived from BIBREF306   Lakh MIDI Dataset Multi-instrumental 176,581MIDI files http://colinraffel.com/pro-jects/lmd/  Projective Orchestral Database Orchestral 392 MIDI files grouped in pairs containing a piano score and its orchestral version https://qsdfo.github.io/LOP-/database  e-Piano Competition Dataset Polyphonic & Performance \\sim 1400 MIDI files of piano performance http://www.piano-e-competition.com  BitMidi Polyphonic 113,244 MIDI files curated by volunteers around the world https://bitmidi.com/  Classical Archives Polyphonic Maximum number of MIDI files of free classical music https://www.classical-archives.com/  The largest MIDI dataset on the Internet Polyphonic & Style About 130,000 pieces of music from 8 distinct genres (classical, metal, folk, etc.) http://stoneyroads.com/20-15/06/behold-the-worlds-biggest-midicollection-on-the-internet/  ADL Piano MIDI Polyphonic 11,086 unique piano MIDI files https://github.com/lucasnfe/-adl-piano-midi  GiantMIDI-Piano Polyphonic 10,854 MIDI files of classical piano, 1,237 hours in total https://github.com/byte-dance/GiantMIDI-Piano 4*MusicXML TheoryTab Database Polyphonic 16K lead sheet segments https://www.hooktheory.-com/theorytab  Hooktheory Lead Sheet dataset Polyphonic 11,329 lead sheet segments Derived from BIBREF179   Wikifonia Polyphonic 2,252 western music lead sheets http://marg.snu.ac.kr/chord_-generation/(CSV format)  MuseScore lead sheet dataset Performance lead sheet corresponding to Yamaha e-Competitions MIDI dataset https://musescore.com Pianoroll Lakh Pianoroll Dataset Multi-instrumental Approximately equal to the size of LMD https://salu133445.github.-io/musegan/ 4*Text Nottingham Music Dataset Monophonic About 1,000 folk songs abc.sourceforge.net/NMD/  ABC tune book of Henrik Norbeck Monophonic More than 2,800 scores and lyrics in ABC format, mainly Irish and Swiss traditional music http://www.norbeck.nu/abc/  ABC version of FolkDB Monophonic Unknown https://thesession.org/  KernScores Polyphonic Over 700 million notes in 108,703 files http://kern.humdrum.org 6*Audio NSynth Dataset Music audio 306,043 notes https://magenta.tensorflow.-org/datasets/nsynth  FMA dataset Music audio 106,574 tracks of 917GiB Derived from cite212  Minist musical sound dataset Music audio 50,912 notes https://github.com/ejhum-phrey/minst-dataset/  GTZAN Dataset Music audio 1,000 30s music audios http://marsyas.info/down-load/data_sets  Studio On-Line (SOL) Music audio 120,000 sounds Derived from BIBREF315   NUS Sung and Spoken Lyrics(NUS-48E) Corpus Sing Voice 169 minutes recordings of 48 English songs Derived from BIBREF316  9*  MusicNet Dataset Fusion 330 recordings of classical music https://homes.cs.washing-ton.edu/\\sim thickstn/musicnet-.html  MAESTRO Dataset Fusion 172 hours of virtuosic piano performances https://g.co/magenta/-maestrodataset  NES Music Database Multi-instrumental thousands of Derived from BIBREF199   Piano-Midi Polyphonic & performance 332 classical piano pieces www.piano-midi.de/  Groove MIDI Dataset Drum 13.6 hours recordings, 1,150 MIDI files and over 22,000 measures of tempo-aligned expressive drumming https://magenta.tensorflow-.org/datasets/groove  POP909 Polyphonic multiple versions of the piano arrangements of 909 popular songs https://github.com/music-x-lab/POP909-Dataset  ASAP Polyphonic Performance& Fusion 222 digital musical scores aligned with 1,068 performances https://github.com/fosfrance-sco/asap-dataset  Aligned lyrics-melody music dataset Fusion 13,937 20-note sequences with 278,740 syllable-note pairs https://github.com/yy1lab/-Lyrics-Conditioned-Neural-Melody-Generation  MTM Dataset Fusion Unknown https://github.com/Morning-Books/MTM-Dataset  The Projective Orchestral Database (POD) is devoted to the study of the relationship between piano scores and corresponding orchestral arrangements.

BIBREF357 provided a pre-computed pianoroll representation. In addition, they also proposed a method to automatically align piano scores and their corresponding orchestral arrangements, resulting in a new version of MIDI database. They provide all MIDI files as well as preprocessed pianoroll representations of alignment and misalignment for free on the following website https://qsdfo.github.io/LOP/index.html.   The e-piano junior competition is an international classical piano competition. The e-piano junior competition dataset is a collection of professional pianists' solo piano performances. It is the largest public dataset that provides a substantial amount of expressive performance MIDI ( 1400) of professional pianists. Most of them are late romantic works, such as Chopin and Liszt, as well as some Mozart sonatas. Since this dataset provides high-quality piano performance data in MIDI, including the fine control of timing and dynamics by different performers, the dataset is widely used in the research of performance generation, but it does not contain the corresponding music score of the pieces BIBREF354 .   The ADL piano MIDI dataset is based on LMD. In LMD, there are many versions of the same song, and only one version is reserved for each song in the ADL dataset. Later, Ferreira et al. BIBREF355 extracted from the LMD only the tracks with instruments from the \u201cpiano family\" (MIDI program number 1-8). This process generated a total of 9,021 unique piano MIDI files. These files are mainly rock and classical music, so in order to increase the genres diversity (as jazz, etc.) of the dataset, they have added another 2,065 files obtained from public resources on the Internet FOOTREF78 . All the files in the collection are de-duped according to MD5 checksums, and the final dataset has 11,086 pieces.   Recently, ByteDance released GiantMIDI-Piano BIBREF358, the world's largest classical piano dataset, including MIDI files from 10,854 music works of 2,784 composers, with a total duration of 1,237 hours. In terms of data scale, the total duration of different music pieces in the dataset is 14 times that of Google\u2019s MAESTRO dataset. In order to construct the dataset, researchers have developed and open-sourced a high-resolution piano transcription system, which is used to convert all audio into MIDI files. MIDI files include the onset, dynamics and pedal information of notes.   In addition, BitMidi FOOTREF79 provides 113,244 MIDI files curated by volunteers around the world; Classical Archives FOOTREF80 is the largest classical music website, including the largest collection of free classical music MIDI files; the largest MIDI dataset FOOTREF81 on the Internet contains about 130,000 music from eight different genres (classical, metal, folk, etc.); FreeMidi FOOTREF82 comprises more than 25,860 MIDI files of assorted genres.

In this paper, we introduce the Nintendo Entertainment System Music Database (NES-MDB), a large corpus\nallowing for separate examination of the tasks of composition and performance. NES-MDB contains thousands of\nmulti-instrumental songs composed for playback by the\ncompositionally-constrained NES audio synthesizer. For\neach song, the dataset contains a musical score for four\ninstrument voices as well as expressive attributes for the\ndynamics and timbre of each voice. Unlike datasets comprised of General MIDI files, NES-MDB includes all of the\ninformation needed to render exact acoustic performances\nof the original compositions. Alongside the dataset, we\nprovide a tool that renders generated compositions as NESstyle audio by emulating the device\u2019s audio processor. Additionally, we establish baselines for the tasks of composition, which consists of learning the semantics of composing for the NES synthesizer, and performance, which\ninvolves finding a mapping between a composition and realistic expressive attributes.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nThe problem of automating music composition is a challenging pursuit with the potential for substantial cultural\nimpact. While early systems were hand-crafted by musicians to encode musical rules and structure [25], recent attempts view composition as a statistical modeling problem\nusing machine learning [3]. A major challenge to casting\nthis problem in terms of modern machine learning methods is building representative datasets for training. So far,\nmost datasets only contain information necessary to model\nthe semantics of music composition, and lack details about\nhow to translate these pieces into nuanced performances.\nAs a result, demonstrations of machine learning systems\ntrained on these datasets sound rigid and deadpan. The\ndatasets that do contain expressive performance character-\nc\u20dd Chris Donahue, Huanru Henry Mao, Julian McAuley.\nLicensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0).\nAttribution:\nChris Donahue, Huanru Henry\nMao, Julian McAuley. \u201cThe NES Music Database: A multi-instrumental\ndataset with expressive performance attributes\u201d, 19th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference, Paris, France, 2018.\nistics predominantly focus on solo piano [10,27,32] rather\nthan multi-instrumental music.\nA promising source of multi-instrumental music that\ncontains both compositional and expressive characteristics is music from early videogames.\nThere are nearly\n1400 1 unique games licensed for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), all of which include a musical soundtrack. The technical constraints of the system\u2019s audio processing unit (APU) impose a maximum of four simultaneous monophonic instruments.\nThe machine code for\nthe games preserves the exact expressive characteristics\nneeded to perform each piece of music as intended by the\ncomposer. All of the music was composed in a limited time\nperiod and, as a result, is more stylistically cohesive than\nother large datasets of multi-instrumental music. Moreover, NES music is celebrated by enthusiasts who continue\nto listen to and compose music for the system [6], appreciating the creativity that arises from resource limitations.\nIn this work, we introduce NES-MDB, and formalize\ntwo primary tasks for which the dataset serves as a large\ntest bed. The first task consists of learning the semantics of\ncomposition on a separated score, where individual instrument voices are explicitly represented. This is in contrast\nto the common blended score approach for modeling polyphonic music, which examines reductions of full scores.\nThe second task consists of mapping compositions onto\nsets of expressive performance characteristics. Combining\nstrategies for separated composition and expressive performance yields an effective pipeline for generating NES music de novo. We establish baseline results and reproducible\nevaluation methodology for both tasks. A further contribution of this work is a library that converts between NES\nmachine code (allowing for realistic playback) and representations suitable for machine learning. 2\n2. BACKGROUND AND TASK DESCRIPTIONS\nStatistical modeling of music seeks to learn the distribution\nP(music) from human compositions c\n\u223c\nP(music) in\na dataset M. If this distribution could be estimated accurately, a new piece could be composed simply by sampling.\nSince the space of potential compositions is exponentially\nlarge, to make sampling tractable, one usually assumes a\nfactorized distribution. For monophonic sequences, which\nconsist of no more than one note at a time, the probability\n1 Including games released only on the Japanese version of the console\n2 https://github.com/chrisdonahue/nesmdb\narXiv:1806.04278v1  [cs.SD]  12 Jun 2018\n\f(a) Blended score (degenerate)\n(b) Separated score (melodic voices top, percussive voice bottom)\n(c) Expressive score (includes dynamics and timbral changes)\nFigure 1: Three representations (rendered as piano rolls)\nfor a segment of Ending Theme from Abadox (1989) by\ncomposer Kiyohiro Sada.\nThe blended score (Fig. 1a),\nused in prior polyphonic composition research, is degenerate when multiple voices play the same note.\nof a sequence c (length T) might be factorized as\nP(c) = P(n1) \u00b7 P(n2 | n1) \u00b7 . . . \u00b7 P(nT | nt<T ).\n(1)\n2.1 Blended composition\nWhile Eq. 1 may be appropriate for modeling compositions\nfor monophonic instruments, in this work we are interested\nin the problem of multi-instrumental polyphonic composition, where multiple monophonic instrument voices may\nbe sounding simultaneously. Much of the prior research\non this topic [2,5,17] represents music in a blended score\nrepresentation. A blended score B is a sparse binary matrix of size N \u00d7 T, where N is the number of possible\nnote values, and B[n, t] = 1 if any voice is playing note\nn at timestep t or 0 otherwise (Fig. 1a). Often, N is constrained to the 88 keys on a piano keyboard, and T is determined by some subdivision of the meter, such as sixteenth\nnotes. When polyphonic composition c is represented by\nB, statistical models often factorize the distribution as a\nsequence of chords, the columns Bt:\nP(c) = P(B1) \u00b7 P(B2 | B1) \u00b7 . . . \u00b7 P(BT | Bt<T ). (2)\nThis representation simplifies the probabilistic framework of the task, but it is problematic for music with multiple instruments (such as the music in NES-MDB). Resultant systems must provide an additional mechanism for\nassigning notes of a blended score to instrument voices,\nor otherwise render the music on polyphonic instruments\nsuch as the piano.\n2.2 Separated composition\nGiven the shortcomings of the blended score, we might\nprefer models which operate on a separated score representation (Fig. 1b). A separated score S is a matrix of size\nV \u00d7 T, where V is the number of instrument voices, and\nS[v, t] = n, the note n played by voice v at timestep t. In\nother words, the format encodes a monophonic sequence\nfor each instrument voice. Statistical approaches to this\nrepresentation can explicitly model the relationships between various instrument voices by\nP(c) =\nT\n\ufffd\nt=1\nV\ufffd\nv=1\nP(Sv,t | Sv,\u02c6t\u0338=t, S\u02c6v\u0338=v,\u2200\u02c6t).\n(3)\nThis formulation explicitly models the dependencies\nbetween Sv,t, voice v at time t, and every other note in\nthe score.\nFor this reason, Eq. 3 more closely resembles the process by which human composers write multiinstrumental music, incorporating temporal and contrapuntal information. Another benefit is that resultant models\ncan be used to harmonize with existing musical material,\nadding voices conditioned on existing ones. However, any\nnon-trivial amount of temporal context introduces highdimensional interdependencies, meaning that such a formulation would be challenging to sample from. As a consequence, solutions are often restricted to only take past\ntemporal context into account, allowing for simple and efficient ancestral sampling (though Gibbs sampling can also\nbe used to sample from Eq. 3 [13,16]).\nMost existing datasets of multi-instrumental music have\nuninhibited polyphony, causing a separated score representation to be inappropriate. However, the hardware constraints of the NES APU impose a strict limit on the number of voices, making the format ideal for NES-MDB.\n2.3 Expressive performance\nGiven a piece of a music, a skilled performer will embellish the piece with expressive characteristics, altering\nthe timing and dynamics to deliver a compelling rendition.\nWhile a few instruments have been augmented to capture\nthis type of information symbolically (e.g. a Disklavier),\nit is rarely available for examination in datasets of multiinstrumental music. Because NES music is comprised of\ninstructions that recreate an exact rendition of each piece,\nexpressive characteristics controlling the velocity and timbre of each voice are available in NES-MDB (details in\nSection 3.1). Thus, each piece can be represented as an\nexpressive score (Fig. 1c), the union of its separated score\nand expressive characteristics.\nWe consider the task of mapping a composition c onto\nexpressive characteristics e.\nHence, we would like to\nmodel P(e | c), and the probability of a piece of music\nP(m) can be expressed as P(e | c) \u00b7 P(c), where P(c) is\nfrom Eq. 3. This allows for a convenient pipeline for music\ngeneration where a piece of music is first composed with\nbinary amplitudes and then mapped to realistic dynamics,\nas if interpreted by a performer.\n\f# Games\n397\n# Composers\n296\n# Songs\n5, 278\n# Songs w/ length > 10s\n3, 513\n# Notes\n2, 325, 636\nDataset length\n46.1 hours\nP(Pulse 1 On)\n0.861\nP(Pulse 2 On)\n0.838\nP(Triangle On)\n0.701\nP(Noise On)\n0.390\nAverage polyphony\n2.789\nTable 1: Basic dataset information for NES-MDB.\n2.4 Task summary\nIn summary, we propose three tasks for which NES-MDB\nserves as a large test bed. A pairing of two models that\naddress the second and third tasks can be used to generate\nnovel NES music.\n1. The blended composition task (Eq. 2) models the\nsemantics of blended scores (Fig. 1a). This task is\nmore useful for benchmarking new algorithms than\nfor NES composition.\n2. The separated composition task consists of modeling the semantics of separated scores (Fig. 1b) using\nthe factorization from Eq. 3.\n3. The expressive performance task seeks to map separated scores to expressive characteristics needed to\ngenerate an expressive score (Fig. 1c).\n3. DATASET DESCRIPTION\nThe NES APU consists of five monophonic instruments:\ntwo pulse wave generators (P1/P2), a triangle wave generator (TR), a noise generator (NO), and a sampler which\nallows for playback of audio waveforms stored in memory. Because the sampler may be used to play melodic or\npercussive sounds, its usage is compositionally ambiguous\nand we exclude it from our dataset.\nIn raw form, music for NES games exists as machine\ncode living in the read-only memory of cartridges, entangled with the rest of the game logic. An effective method\nfor extracting a musical transcript is to emulate the game\nand log the timing and values of writes to the APU registers. The video game music (VGM) format 3 was designed\nfor precisely this purpose, and consists of an ordered list\nof writes to APU registers with 44.1 kHz timing resolution. An online repository 4 contains over 400 NES games\nlogged in this format. After removing duplicates, we split\nthese games into distinct training, validation and test subsets with an 8:1:1 ratio, ensuring that no composer appears\nin two of the subsets. Basic statistics of the dataset appear\nin Table 1.\n3 http://vgmrips.net/wiki/VGM_Specification\n4 http://vgmrips.net/packs/chip/nes-apu\n3.1 Extracting expressive scores\nGiven the VGM files, we emulate the functionality of the\nAPU to yield an expressive score (Fig. 1c) at a temporal discretization of 44.1 kHz. This rate is unnecessarily\nhigh for symbolic music, so we subsequently downsample the scores. 5 Because the music has no explicit tempo\nmarkings, we accommodate a variety of implicit tempos by\nchoosing a permissive downsampling rate of 24 Hz. By removing dynamics, timbre, and voicing at each timestep, we\nderive separated score (Fig. 1b) and blended score (Fig. 1a)\nversions of the dataset.\nInstrument\nNote\nVelocity\nTimbre\nPulse 1 (P1)\n{0, 32, . . . , 108}\n[0, 15]\n[0, 3]\nPulse 2 (P2)\n{0, 32, . . . , 108}\n[0, 15]\n[0, 3]\nTriangle (TR)\n{0, 21, . . . , 108}\nNoise (NO)\n{0, 1, . . . , 16}\n[0, 15]\n[0, 1]\nTable 2: Dimensionality for each timestep of the expressive score representation (Fig. 1c) in NES-MDB.\nIn Table 2, we show the dimensionality of the instrument states at each timestep of an expressive score in NESMDB. We constrain the frequency ranges of the melodic\nvoices (pulse and triangle generators) to the MIDI notes\non an 88-key piano keyboard (21 through 108 inclusive,\nthough the pulse generators cannot produce pitches below\nMIDI note 32). The percussive noise voice has 16 possible\n\u201cnotes\u201d (these do not correspond to MIDI note numbers)\nwhere higher values have more high-frequency noise. For\nall instruments, a note value of 0 indicates that the instrument is not sounding (and the corresponding velocity will\nbe 0). When sounding, the pulse and noise generators have\n15 non-linear velocity values, while the triangle generator\nhas no velocity control beyond on or off.\nAdditionally, the pulse wave generators have 4 possible duty cycles (affecting timbre), and the noise generator\nhas a rarely-used mode where it instead produces metallic\ntones. Unlike for velocity, a timbre value of 0 corresponds\nto an actual timbre setting and does not indicate that an instrument is muted. In total, the pulse, triangle and noise\ngenerators have state spaces of sizes 4621, 89, and 481\nrespectively\u2014around 40 bits of information per timestep\nfor the full ensemble.\n4. EXPERIMENTS AND DISCUSSION\nBelow, we describe our evaluation criteria for experiments\nin separated composition and expressive performance. We\npresent these results only as statistical baselines for comparison; results do not necessarily reflect a model\u2019s ability\nto generate compelling musical examples.\nNegative log-likelihood and Accuracy Negative loglikelihood (NLL) is the (log of the) likelihood that a model\nassigns to unseen real data (as per Eq. 3). A low NLL averaged across unseen data may indicate that a model captures\n5 We also release NES-MDB in MIDI format with no downsampling\n\fsemantics of the data distribution. Accuracy is defined as\nthe proportion of timesteps where a model\u2019s prediction is\nequal to the actual composition. We report both measures\nfor each voice, as well as aggregations across all voices by\nsumming (for NLL) and averaging (for accuracy).\nPoints of Interest (POI). Unlike other datasets of symbolic music, NES-MDB is temporally-discretized at a\nhigh, fixed rate (24 Hz), rather than at a variable rate depending on the tempo of the music. As a consequence,\nany given voice has around an 83% chance of playing the\nsame note as that voice at the previous timestep. Accordingly, our primary evaluation criteria focuses on musicallysalient points of interest (POIs), timesteps at which a voice\ndeviates from the previous timestep (the beginning or end\nof a note). This evaluation criterion is mostly invariant to\nthe rate of temporal discretization.\n4.1 Separated composition experiments\nFor separated composition, we evaluate the performance\nof several baselines and compare them to a cutting edge\nmethod. Our simplest baselines are unigram and additivesmoothed bigram distributions for each instrument. The\npredictions of such models are trivial; the unigram model\nalways predicts \u201cno note\u201d and the bigram model always\npredicts \u201clast note\u201d. The respective accuracy of these models, 37% and 83%, reflect the proportion of the timesteps\nthat are silent (unigram) or identical to the last timestep (bigram). However, if we evaluate these models only at POIs,\ntheir performance is substantially worse (4% and 0%).\nWe also measure performance of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) at modeling the voices independently. We\ntrain a separate RNN (either a basic RNN cell or an\nLSTM cell [15]) on each voice to form our RNN Soloists\nand LSTM Soloists baselines.\nWe compare these to\nLSTM Quartet, a model consisting of a single LSTM that\nprocesses all four voices and outputs an independent softmax over each note category, giving the model full context of the composition in progress.\nAll RNNs have 2\nlayers and 256 units, except for soloists which have 64\nunits each, and we train them with 512 steps of unrolling\nfor backpropagation through time. We train all models to\nminimize NLL using the Adam optimizer [19] and employ\nearly stopping based on the NLL of the validation set.\nWhile the DeepBach model [13] was designed for modeling the chorales of J.S. Bach, the four-voice structure of\nthose chorales is shared by NES-MDB, making the model\nappropriate for evaluation in our setting. DeepBach embeds each timestep of the four-voice score and then processes these embeddings with a bidirectional LSTM to aggregate past and future musical context. For each voice,\nthe activations of the bidirectional LSTM are concatenated\nwith an embedding of all of the other voices, providing\nthe model with a mechanism to alter its predictions for any\nvoice in context of the others at that timestep. Finally, these\nmerged representations are concatenated to an independent\nsoftmax for each of the four voices. Results for DeepBach\nand our baselines appear in Table 3.\nAs expected, the performance of all models at POIs is\nworse than the global performance. DeepBach achieves\nsubstantially better performance at POIs than the other\nmodels, likely due to its bidirectional processing which allows the model to \u201cpeek\u201d at future notes. The LSTM Quartet model is attractive because, unlike DeepBach, it permits\nefficient ancestral sampling. However, we observe qualitatively that samples from this model are musically unsatisfying. While the performance of the soloists is worse than\nthe models which examine all voices, the superior performance of the LSTM Soloists to the RNN Soloists suggests\nthat LSTMs may be beneficial in this context.\nWe also experimented with artificially emphasizing\nPOIs during training, however we found that resultant\nmodels produced unrealistically sporadic music.\nBased\non this observation, we recommend that researchers who\nstudy NES-MDB always train models with unbiased emphasis, in order to effectively capture the semantics of the\nparticular temporal discretization.\n4.2 Expressive performance experiments\nThe expressive performance task consists of learning a\nmapping from a separated score to suitable expressive\ncharacteristics. Each timestep of a separated score in NESMDB has note information (random variable N) for the\nfour instrument voices.\nAn expressive score additionally has velocity (V ) and timbre (T) information for P1,\nP2, and NO but not TR. We can express the distribution\nof performance characteristics given the composition as\nP(V, T | N). Some of our proposed solutions factorize\nthis further into a conditional autoregressive formulation\n\ufffdT\nt=1 P(Vt, Tt | N, V\u02c6t<t, T\u02c6t<t), where the model has explicit knowledge of its decisions for velocity and timbre at\nearlier timesteps.\nNotes\nLast velocity\nLast timbre\nLSTM\nBidirectional\nLSTM\nDense\nConcatenate\nConcatenate\nFigure 2:\nLSTM Note+Auto expressive performance\nmodel that observes both the score and its prior output.\nUnlike for separated composition, there are no wellestablished baselines for multi-instrumental expressive\nperformance, and thus we design several approaches.\nFor the autoregressive formulation, our most-sophisticated\nmodel (Fig. 2) uses a bidirectional LSTM to process the\nseparated score, and a forward-directional LSTM for the\nautoregressive expressive characteristics.\nThe represen-\n\fNegative log-likelihood\nAccuracy\nSingle voice\nAggregate\nSingle voice\nAggregate\nModel\nP1\nP2\nTR\nNO\nPOI\nAll\nP1\nP2\nTR\nNO\nPOI\nAll\nRandom\n4.36\n4.36\n4.49\n2.83\n16.04\n16.04\n.013\n.013\n.011\n.059\n.024\n.024\nUnigram\n4.00\n3.77\n3.01\n2.50\n13.27\n11.53\n.020\n.022\n.057\n.061\n.040\n.369\nBigram\n4.91\n4.93\n4.15\n3.52\n17.50\n3.63\n.000\n.000\n.000\n.000\n.000\n.831\nRNN Soloists\n4.92\n4.90\n3.59\n2.23\n15.64\n3.11\n.000\n.000\n.004\n.183\n.047\n.830\nLSTM Soloists\n4.60\n4.30\n3.01\n1.91\n13.82\n2.70\n.014\n.008\n.125\n.246\n.098\n.838\nLSTM Quartet\n3.87\n3.71\n2.45\n1.62\n11.65\n2.21\n.028\n.031\n.294\n.449\n.201\n.854\nDeepBach [13]\n0.82\n1.01\n0.63\n0.83\n3.28\n0.75\n.781\n.729\n.784\n.748\n.761\n.943\nTable 3: Results for separated composition experiments.

We compare this model (LSTM\nNote+Auto) to a version which removes the autoregressive\nmodule and only sees the separated score (LSTM Note).\nWe also measure performance of simple multinomial\nregression baselines.\nThe non-autoregressive baseline\n(MultiReg Note) maps the concatenation of NP1, NP2,\nNTR, and NNO directly to the six categorical outputs representing velocity and timbre (no temporal context).

Additionally, we\nshow results for simple baselines (per-category unigram\nand bigram distributions) which do not consider N. Because the noise timbre field TNO is so rarely used (less than\n0.2% of all timesteps), we exclude it from our quantitative\nevaluation. Results are shown in Table 4.\nSimilarly to the musical notes in the separated composition task (Section 4.1), the high rate of NES-MDB results in substantial redundancy across timesteps. Averaged\nacross all velocity and timbre categories, any of these categories at a given timestep has a 74% chance of having the\nsame value as the previous timestep.\nThe performance of the LSTM Note model is comparable to that of the LSTM Note+Auto model at POIs,\nhowever the global performance of the LSTM Note+Auto\nmodel is substantially better.

The latter overfit more quickly which\nmay explain its inferior performance despite the fact that it\nsees strictly more information than the note-only model.\n4.3 Blended composition experiments\nIn Table 5, we report the performance of several models\non the blended composition task (Eq. 2). In NES-MDB,\nblended scores consist of 88 possible notes with a maximum of three simultaneous voices (noise generator is discarded). This task, standardized in [2], does not preserve\nthe voicing of the score, and thus it is not immediately\nuseful for generating NES music. Nevertheless, modeling\nblended scores of polyphonic music has become a standard\nbenchmark for sequential models [5, 18], and NES-MDB\n\fmay be useful as a larger dataset in the same format.\nIn general, models assign higher likelihood to NESMDB than the four other datasets after training. As with\nour other two tasks, this is likely due to the fact that NESMDB is sampled at a higher temporal rate, and thus the average deviation across timesteps is lower. Due to its large\nsize, a benefit of examining NES-MDB in this context is\nthat sequential models tend to take longer to overfit the\ndataset than they do for the other four. We note that our implementations of these models may deviate slightly from\nthose of the original authors, though our models achieve\ncomparable results to those reported in [2,17] when trained\non the original datasets.\n5. RELATED WORK\nThere are several popular datasets commonly used in statistical music composition. A dataset consisting of the entirety of J.S. Bach\u2019s four-voice chorales has been extensively studied under the lenses of algorithmic composition\nand reharmonization [1, 2, 13, 14]. Like NES-MDB, this\ndataset has a fixed number of voices and can be represented as a separated score (Fig. 1b), however it is small in\nsize (389 chorales) and lacks expressive information. Another popular dataset is Piano-midi.de, a corpus of classical piano from various composers [27].\nThis dataset\nhas expressive timing and dynamics information but has\nheterogeneous time periods and only features solo piano\nmusic. Alongside Bach\u2019s chorales and the Piano-midi.de\ndataset, Boulanger-Lewandowski et al. (2012) standardized the Nottingham collection of folk tunes and MuseData\nlibrary of orchestral and piano classical music into blended\nscore format (Fig. 1a).\nSeveral other symbolic datasets exist containing both\ncompositional and expressive characteristics. The Magaloff Corpus [10] consists of Disklavier recordings of a\nprofessional pianist playing the entirety of Chopin\u2019s solo\npiano works. The Lakh MIDI dataset [28] is the largest\ncorpus of symbolic music assembled to date with nearly\n200k songs. While substantially larger than NES-MDB,\nthe dataset has unconstrained polyphony, inconsistent expressive characteristics, and encompasses a wide variety of\ngenres, instruments and time periods. Another paper trains\nneural networks on transcriptions of video game music [9],\nthough their dataset only includes a handful of songs.\n5.1 Statistical composition\nWhile most of the early research in algorithmic music\ncomposition focused on expert systems [25], statistical approaches have since become the predominant approach.\nMozer (1994) trained RNNs on monophonic melodies using a formulation similar to Eq. 1, finding the composed results to compare favorably to those from a trigram model.\nOthers have also explored monophonic melody generation\nwith RNNs [8,26]. Boulanger-Lewandowski et al. (2012)\nstandardize the polyphonic prediction task for blended\nscores (Eq. 2), measuring performance of a multitude of\nclassical baselines against RNNs [30], restricted Boltz-\nmann machines [34], and NADEs [21] on polyphonic music datasets. Several papers [5,17,35] directly compare to\ntheir results. Statistical models of music have also been\nemployed as symbolic priors to assist music transcription\nalgorithms [2,4,24].\nProgressing towards models that assist humans in composition, many researchers study models to create new\nharmonizations for existing musical material. Allan and\nWilliams (2005) train HMMs to create new harmonizations\nfor Bach chorales [1]. Hadjeres et al. (2017) train a bidirectional RNN model to consider past and future temporal\ncontext (Eq. 3) [13]. Along with [16, 31], they advocate\nfor the usage of Gibbs sampling to generate music from\ncomplex graphical models.\n5.2 Statistical performance\nMusicians perform music expressively by interpreting a\nperformance with appropriate dynamics, timing and articulation.\nComputational models of expressive music\nperformance seek to automatically assign such attributes\nto a score [36].\nWe point to several extensive surveys\nfor information about the long history of rule-based systems [7,12,20,36].\nSeveral statistical models of expressive performance\nhave also been proposed. Raphael (2010) learns a graphical model that automates an accompanying orchestra for\na soloist, operating on acoustic features rather than symbolic [29]. Flossmann et al. (2013) build a system to control velocity, articulation and timing of piano performances\nby learning a graphical model from a large symbolic corpus of human performances [11]. Xia et al. (2015) model\nthe expressive timing and dynamics of piano duet performances using spectral methods [37]. Two end-to-end systems attempt to jointly learn the semantics of composition\nand expressive performance using RNNs [23, 33]. Malik\nand Ek (2017) train an RNN to generate velocity information given a musical score [22]. These approaches differ\nfrom our own in that they focus on piano performances\nrather than multi-instrumental music.\n6. CONCLUSION\nThe NES Music Database is a large corpus for examining\nmulti-instrumental polyphonic composition and expressive\nperformance generation. Compared to existing datasets,\nNES-MDB allows for examination of the \u201cfull pipeline\u201d\nof music composition and performance.\nWe parse the\nmachine code of NES music into familiar formats (e.g.\nMIDI), eliminating the need for researchers to understand\nlow-level details of the game system.\nWe also provide\nan open-source tool which converts between the simpler\nformats and machine code, allowing researchers to audition their generated results as waveforms rendered by\nthe NES. We hope that this dataset will facilitate a new\nparadigm of research on music generation\u2014one that emphasizes the importance of expressive performance. To this\nend, we establish several baselines with reproducible evaluation methodology to encourage further investigation.\n\f7.

Much of the prior research on this topic [17, 2, 5] represents music in a blended score representation. A blended score \\(B\\) is a sparse binary matrix of size \\(N\\times T\\), where \\(N\\) is the number of possible note values, and \\(B[n,t]=1\\) if any voice is playing note \\(n\\) at timestep \\(t\\) or \\(0\\) otherwise (Fig. 0(a)). Often, \\(N\\) is constrained to the \\(88\\) keys on a piano keyboard, and \\(T\\) is determined by some subdivision of the meter, such as sixteenth notes. When polyphonic composition \\(\\mathbf{c}\\) is represented by \\(B\\), statistical models often factorize the distribution as a sequence of _chords_, the columns \\(B_{t}\\):\n\n\\[P(\\mathbf{c})=P(B_{1})\\cdot P(B_{2}\\mid B_{1})\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot P(B_{T}\\mid B_{t<T}). \\tag{2}\\]\n\nThis representation simplifies the probabilistic framework of the task, but it is problematic for music with multiple instruments (such as the music in NES-MDB). Resultant systems must provide an additional mechanism for assigning notes of a blended score to instrument voices, or otherwise render the music on polyphonic instruments such as the piano.\n\n### Separated composition\n\nGiven the shortcomings of the blended score, we might prefer models which operate on a separated score representation (Fig. 0(b)). A separated score \\(S\\) is a matrix of size \\(V\\times T\\), where \\(V\\) is the number of instrument voices, and \\(S[v,t]=n\\), the note \\(n\\) played by voice \\(v\\) at timestep \\(t\\). In other words, the format encodes a monophonic sequence for each instrument voice. Statistical approaches to this representation can explicitly model the relationships between various instrument voices by\n\n\\[P(\\mathbf{c})=\\prod_{t=1}^{T}\\prod_{v=1}^{V}P(S_{v,t}\\mid S_{v,t\\neq t},S_{\\phi \\neq v,\\forall t}). \\tag{3}\\]\n\nThis formulation explicitly models the dependencies between \\(S_{v,t}\\), voice \\(v\\) at time \\(t\\), and every other note in the score. For this reason, Eq. 3 more closely resembles the process by which human composers write multi-instrumental music, incorporating temporal and contrapuntal information. Another benefit is that resultant models can be used to harmonize with existing musical material, adding voices conditioned on existing ones. However, any non-trivial amount of temporal context introduces high-dimensional interdependencies, meaning that such a formulation would be challenging to sample from. As a consequence, solutions are often restricted to only take past temporal context into account, allowing for simple and efficient ancestral sampling (though Gibbs sampling can also be used to sample from Eq. 3[13, 16]).\n\nMost existing datasets of multi-instrumental music have uninhibited polyphony, causing a separated score representation to be inappropriate. However, the hardware constraints of the NES APU impose a strict limit on the number of voices, making the format ideal for NES-MDB.\n\n### Expressive performance\n\nGiven a piece of a music, a skilled performer will embellish the piece with _expressive characteristics_, altering the timing and dynamics to deliver a compelling rendition. While a few instruments have been augmented to capture this type of information symbolically (e.g. a Disklavier), it is rarely available for examination in datasets of multi-instrumental music. Because NES music is comprised of instructions that recreate an exact rendition of each piece, expressive characteristics controlling the velocity and timbre of each voice are available in NES-MDB (details in Section 3.1). Thus, each piece can be represented as an _expressive score_ (Fig. 0(c)), the union of its separated score and expressive characteristics.\n\nWe consider the task of mapping a composition \\(\\mathbf{c}\\) onto expressive characteristics \\(\\mathbf{e}\\). Hence, we would like to model \\(P(\\mathbf{e}\\mid\\mathbf{c})\\), and the probability of a piece of music \\(P(\\mathbf{m})\\) can be expressed as \\(P(\\mathbf{e}\\mid\\mathbf{c})\\cdot P(\\mathbf{c})\\), where \\(P(\\mathbf{c})\\) is from Eq. 3. This allows for a convenient pipeline for music generation where a piece of music is first composed with binary amplitudes and then mapped to realistic dynamics, as if interpreted by a performer.\n\nFigure 1: Three representations (rendered as piano rolls) for a segment of _Ending Theme_ from _Abadox_ (1989) by composer Kiyohiro Sada. The blended score (Fig. 0(a)), used in prior polyphonic composition research, is degenerate when multiple voices play the same note.\n\n### Task summary\n\nIn summary, we propose three tasks for which NES-MDB serves as a large test bed. A pairing of two models that address the second and third tasks can be used to generate novel NES music.\n\n1. The _blended composition_ task (Eq. 2) models the semantics of blended scores (Fig. 1a). This task is more useful for benchmarking new algorithms than for NES composition.\n2. The _separated composition_ task consists of modeling the semantics of separated scores (Fig. 1b) using the factorization from Eq. 3.\n3. The _expressive performance_ task seeks to map separated scores to expressive characteristics needed to generate an expressive score (Fig. 1c).\n\n## 3 Dataset description\n\nThe NES APU consists of five monophonic instruments: two pulse wave generators (P1/P2), a triangle wave generator (TR), a noise generator (NO), and a sampler which allows for playback of audio waveforms stored in memory. Because the sampler may be used to play melodic or percussive sounds, its usage is compositionally ambiguous and we exclude it from our dataset.\n\nIn raw form, music for NES games exists as machine code living in the read-only memory of cartridges, entangled with the rest of the game logic. An effective method for extracting a musical transcript is to emulate the game and log the timing and values of writes to the APU registers. The video game music (VGM) format 3 was designed for precisely this purpose, and consists of an ordered list of writes to APU registers with \\(44.1\\,\\mathrm{kHz}\\) timing resolution. An online repository 4 contains over \\(400\\) NES games logged in this format. After removing duplicates, we split these games into distinct training, validation and test subsets with an \\(8\\):\\(1\\):\\(1\\) ratio, ensuring that no composer appears in two of the subsets. Basic statistics of the dataset appear in Table 1.\n\nFootnote 3: [http://vgmrips.net/wiki/VGM_Specification](http://vgmrips.net/wiki/VGM_Specification)\n\nFootnote 4: [http://vgmrips.net/packs/chip/nes-apu](http://vgmrips.net/packs/chip/nes-apu)\n\n### Extracting expressive scores\n\nGiven the VGM files, we emulate the functionality of the APU to yield an expressive score (Fig. 1c) at a temporal discretization of \\(44.1\\,\\mathrm{kHz}\\). This rate is unnecessarily high for symbolic music, so we subsequently downsample the scores.5 Because the music has no explicit tempo markings, we accommodate a variety of implicit tempos by choosing a permissive downsampling rate of \\(24\\,\\mathrm{Hz}\\). By removing dynamics, timbre, and voicing at each timestep, we derive separated score (Fig. 1b) and blended score (Fig. 1a) versions of the dataset.\n\nFootnote 5: We also release NES-MDB in MIDI format with no downsampling\n\nIn Table 2, we show the dimensionality of the instrument states at each timestep of an expressive score in NES-MDB. We constrain the frequency ranges of the _melodic_ voices (pulse and triangle generators) to the MIDI notes on an \\(88\\)-key piano keyboard (\\(21\\) through \\(108\\) inclusive, though the pulse generators cannot produce pitches below MIDI note \\(32\\)). The _percussive_ noise voice has \\(16\\) possible \"notes\" (these do not correspond to MIDI note numbers) where higher values have more high-frequency noise. For all instruments, a note value of \\(0\\) indicates that the instrument is not sounding (and the corresponding velocity will be \\(0\\)). When sounding, the pulse and noise generators have \\(15\\) non-linear velocity values, while the triangle generator has no velocity control beyond on or off.\n\nAdditionally, the pulse wave generators have \\(4\\) possible duty cycles (affecting timbre), and the noise generator has a rarely-used mode where it instead produces metallic tones. Unlike for velocity, a timbre value of \\(0\\) corresponds to an actual timbre setting and does not indicate that an instrument is muted. In total, the pulse, triangle and noise generators have state spaces of sizes \\(4621\\), \\(89\\), and \\(481\\) respectively--around \\(40\\) bits of information per timestep for the full ensemble.\n\n## 4 Experiments and discussion\n\nBelow, we describe our evaluation criteria for experiments in separated composition and expressive performance. We present these results only as statistical baselines for comparison; results do not necessarily reflect a model's ability to generate compelling musical examples.\n\n**Negative log-likelihood and Accuracy** Negative log-likelihood (NLL) is the (log of the) likelihood that a model assigns to unseen real data (as per Eq. 3). A low NLL averaged across unseen data may indicate that a model captures\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l|r} \\hline \\hline \\# Games & \\(397\\) \\\\ \\# Composers & \\(296\\) \\\\ \\# Songs & \\(5,278\\) \\\\ \\# Songs w/ length \\(>10\\)s & \\(3,513\\) \\\\ \\# Notes & \\(2,325,636\\) \\\\ Dataset length & \\(46.1\\) hours \\\\ \\(P(\\)Pulse 1 On\\()\\) & \\(0.861\\) \\\\ \\(P(\\)Pulse 2 On\\()\\) & \\(0.838\\) \\\\ \\(P(\\)Triangle On\\()\\) & \\(0.701\\) \\\\ \\(P(\\)Noise On\\()\\) & \\(0.390\\) \\\\ Average polyphony & \\(2.789\\) \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: Basic dataset information for NES-MDB.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c|c c c} \\hline \\hline Instrument & Note & Velocity & Timbre \\\\ \\hline Pulse \\(1\\) (P1) & \\(\\{0,32,\\ldots,108\\}\\) & \\([0,15]\\) & \\([0,3]\\) \\\\ Pulse \\(2\\) (P2) & \\(\\{0,32,\\ldots,108\\}\\) & \\([0,15]\\) & \\([0,3]\\) \\\\ Triangle (TR) & \\(\\{0,21,\\ldots,108\\}\\) & & \\\\ Noise (NO) & \\(\\{0,1,\\ldots,16\\}\\) & \\([0,15]\\) & \\([0,1]\\) \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 2: Dimensionality for each timestep of the expressive score representation (Fig. 1c) in NES-MDB.\n\nsemantics of the data distribution. Accuracy is defined as the proportion of timesteps where a model's prediction is equal to the actual composition. We report both measures for each voice, as well as aggregations across all voices by summing (for NLL) and averaging (for accuracy).\n\n**Points of Interest (POI).** Unlike other datasets of symbolic music, NES-MDB is temporally-discretized at a high, fixed rate (\\(24\\,\\mathrm{Hz}\\)), rather than at a variable rate depending on the tempo of the music. As a consequence, any given voice has around an \\(83\\%\\) chance of playing the same note as that voice at the previous timestep. Accordingly, our primary evaluation criteria focuses on musically-salient _points of interest_ (POIs), timesteps at which a voice deviates from the previous timestep (the beginning or end of a note). This evaluation criterion is mostly invariant to the rate of temporal discretization.\n\n### Separated composition experiments\n\nFor separated composition, we evaluate the performance of several baselines and compare them to a cutting edge method. Our simplest baselines are unigram and additive-smoothed bigram distributions for each instrument. The predictions of such models are trivial; the unigram model always predicts \"no note\" and the bigram model always predicts \"last note\". The respective accuracy of these models, \\(37\\%\\) and \\(83\\%\\), reflect the proportion of the timesteps that are silent (unigram) or identical to the last timestep (bigram). However, if we evaluate these models only at POIs, their performance is substantially worse (\\(4\\%\\) and \\(0\\%\\)).\n\nWe also measure performance of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) at modeling the voices independently. We train a separate RNN (either a basic RNN cell or an LSTM cell [15]) on each voice to form our RNN Soloists and LSTM Soloists baselines. We compare these to LSTM Quartet, a model consisting of a single LSTM that processes all four voices and outputs an independent softmax over each note category, giving the model full context of the composition in progress. All RNNs have \\(2\\) layers and \\(256\\) units, except for soloists which have \\(64\\) units each, and we train them with \\(512\\) steps of unrolling for backpropagation through time. We train all models to minimize NLL using the Adam optimizer [19] and employ early stopping based on the NLL of the validation set.\n\nWhile the DeepBach model [13] was designed for modeling the chorales of J.S. Bach, the four-voice structure of those chorales is shared by NES-MDB, making the model appropriate for evaluation in our setting. DeepBach embeds each timestep of the four-voice score and then processes these embeddings with a bidirectional LSTM to aggregate past and future musical context. For each voice, the activations of the bidirectional LSTM are concatenated with an embedding of all of the other voices, providing the model with a mechanism to alter its predictions for any voice in context of the others at that timestep. Finally, these merged representations are concatenated to an independent softmax for each of the four voices. Results for DeepBach and our baselines appear in Table 3.\n\nAs expected, the performance of all models at POIs is worse than the global performance. DeepBach achieves substantially better performance at POIs than the other models, likely due to its bidirectional processing which allows the model to \"peek\" at future notes. The LSTM Quartet model is attractive because, unlike DeepBach, it permits efficient ancestral sampling. However, we observe qualitatively that samples from this model are musically unsatisfying. While the performance of the soloists is worse than the models which examine all voices, the superior performance of the LSTM Soloists to the RNN Soloists suggests that LSTMs may be beneficial in this context.\n\nWe also experimented with artificially emphasizing POIs during training, however we found that resultant models produced unrealistically sporadic music. Based on this observation, we recommend that researchers who study NES-MDB always train models with unbiased emphasis, in order to effectively capture the semantics of the particular temporal discretization.\n\n### Expressive performance experiments\n\nThe expressive performance task consists of learning a mapping from a separated score to suitable expressive characteristics. Each timestep of a separated score in NES-MDB has note information (random variable \\(N\\)) for the four instrument voices. An expressive score additionally has velocity (\\(V\\)) and timbre (\\(T\\)) information for P1, P2, and NO but not TR. We can express the distribution of performance characteristics given the composition as \\(P(V,\\ T\\ |\\ N)\\). Some of our proposed solutions factorize this further into a conditional autoregressive formulation \\(\\prod_{t=1}^{T}P(V_{t},T_{t}\\ |\\ N,V_{t<t},T_{t<t})\\), where the model has explicit knowledge of its decisions for velocity and timbre at earlier timesteps.\n\nUnlike for separated composition, there are no well-established baselines for multi-instrumental expressive performance, and thus we design several approaches. For the autoregressive formulation, our most-sophisticated model (Fig. 2) uses a bidirectional LSTM to process the separated score, and a forward-directional LSTM for the autoregressive expressive cha\n\nFigure 2: LSTM Note+Auto expressive performance model that observes both the score and its prior output.\n\ntations from the composition and autoregressive modules are merged and processed by an additional dense layer before projecting to six softmaxes, one for each of \\(V_{\\text{P1}}\\), \\(V_{\\text{P2}}\\), \\(V_{\\text{NO}}\\), \\(T_{\\text{P1}}\\), \\(T_{\\text{P2}}\\), and \\(T_{\\text{NO}}\\). We compare this model (LSTM Note+Auto) to a version which removes the autoregressive module and only sees the separated score (LSTM Note).\n\nWe also measure performance of simple multinomial regression baselines. The non-autoregressive baseline (MultiReg Note) maps the concatenation of \\(N_{\\text{P1}}\\), \\(N_{\\text{P2}}\\), \\(N_{\\text{TR}}\\), and \\(N_{\\text{NO}}\\) directly to the six categorical outputs representing velocity and timbre (no temporal context). An autoregressive version of this model (MultiReg Note+Auto) takes additional inputs consisting of the previous timestep for the six velocity and timbre categories. Additionally, we show results for simple baselines (per-category unigram and bigram distributions) which do not consider \\(N\\). Because the noise timbre field \\(T_{\\text{NO}}\\) is so rarely used (less than \\(0.2\\%\\) of all timesteps), we exclude it from our quantitative evaluation. Results are shown in Table 4.\n\nSimilarly to the musical notes in the separated composition task (Section 4.1), the high rate of NES-MDB results in substantial redundancy across timesteps. Averaged across all velocity and timbre categories, any of these categories at a given timestep has a \\(74\\%\\) chance of having the same value as the previous timestep.\n\nThe performance of the LSTM Note model is comparable to that of the LSTM Note+Auto model at POIs, however the global performance of the LSTM Note+Auto model is substantially better. Intuitively, this suggests that the score is useful for knowing _when_ to change, while the past velocity and timbre values are useful for knowing _what_ value to output next. Interestingly, the MultiReg Note model has better performance at POIs than the MultiReg Note+Auto model. The latter overfit more quickly which may explain its inferior performance despite the fact that it sees strictly more information than the note-only model.\n\n### Blended composition experiments\n\nIn Table 5, we report the performance of several models on the blended composition task (Eq. 2). In NES-MDB, blended scores consist of \\(88\\) possible notes with a maximum of three simultaneous voices (noise generator is discarded). This task, standardized in [2], does not preserve the voicing of the score, and thus it is not immediately useful for generating NES music. Nevertheless, modeling blended scores of polyphonic music has become a standard benchmark for sequential models [18, 5], and NES-MDB\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c c c c c c c c c} \\hline \\hline  & \\multicolumn{8}{c}{Negative log-likelihood} & \\multicolumn{8}{c}{Accuracy} \\\\  & \\multicolumn{8}{c}{Single voice} & \\multicolumn{8}{c}{Aggregate} & \\multicolumn{8}{c}{Single voice} & \\multicolumn{8}{c}{Aggregate} \\\\ \\cline{2-13} Model & \\(V_{\\text{P1}}\\) & \\(V_{\\text{P2}}\\) & \\(V_{\\text{NO}}\\) & \\(T_{\\text{P1}}\\) & \\(T_{\\text{P2}}\\) & POI & All & \\(V_{\\text{P1}}\\) & \\(V_{\\text{P2}}\\) & \\(V_{\\text{NO}}\\) & \\(T_{\\text{P1}}\\) & \\(T_{\\text{P2}}\\) & POI & All \\\\ \\hline Random & \\(2.77\\) & \\(2.77\\) & \\(2.77\\) & \\(1.39\\) & \\(1.39\\) & \\(11.09\\) & \\(11.09\\) & \\(.062\\) & \\(.062\\) & \\(.062\\) & \\(.250\\) & \\(.250\\) & \\(.138\\) & \\(.138\\) \\\\ Unigram & \\(2.87\\) & \\(2.89\\) & \\(3.04\\) & \\(1.35\\) & \\(1.33\\) & \\(11.47\\) & \\(9.65\\) & \\(.020\\) & \\(.022\\) & \\(.061\\) & \\(.006\\) & \\(.004\\) & \\(.023\\) & \\(.309\\) \\\\ Bigram & \\(2.82\\) & \\(2.85\\) & \\(2.78\\) & \\(4.27\\) & \\(4.27\\) & \\(17.00\\) & \\(4.57\\) & \\(.000\\) & \\(.000\\) & \\(.000\\) & \\(.000\\) & \\(.000\\) & \\(.000\\) & \\(.741\\) \\\\ MultiReg Note & \\(2.74\\) & \\(2.72\\) & \\(2.23\\) & \\(1.27\\) & \\(1.18\\) & \\(10.13\\) & \\(8.49\\) & \\(.106\\) & \\(.122\\) & \\(.292\\) & \\(.406\\) & \\(.507\\) & \\(.287\\) & \\(.359\\) \\\\ MultiReg Note+Auto & \\(2.58\\) & \\(2.56\\) & \\(2.04\\) & \\(2.90\\) & \\(2.48\\) & \\(12.56\\) & \\(4.32\\) & \\(.073\\) & \\(.100\\) & \\(.345\\) & \\(.071\\) & \\(.096\\) & \\(.137\\) & \\(.752\\) \\\\ LSTM Note & \\(2.68\\) & \\(2.63\\) & \\(2.09\\) & \\(1.32\\) & \\(1.21\\) & \\(9.94\\) & \\(8.28\\) & \\(.115\\) & \\(.134\\) & \\(.305\\) & \\(.456\\) & \\(.532\\) & \\(.308\\) & \\(.365\\) \\\\ LSTM Note+Auto & \\(1.93\\) & \\(1.89\\) & \\(1.99\\) & \\(2.23\\) & \\(1.89\\) & \\(9.93\\) & \\(3.42\\) & \\(.305\\) & \\(.321\\) & \\(.386\\) & \\(.241\\) & \\(.432\\) & \\(.337\\) & \\(.774\\) \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 4: Results for expressive performance experiments evaluated at points of interest (POI).

As with our other two tasks, this is likely due to the fact that NES-MDB is sampled at a higher temporal rate, and thus the average deviation across timesteps is lower. Due to its large size, a benefit of examining NES-MDB in this context is that sequential models tend to take longer to overfit the dataset than they do for the other four. We note that our implementations of these models may deviate slightly from those of the original authors, though our models achieve comparable results to those reported in [2, 17] when trained on the original datasets.\n\n## 5 Related Work\n\nThere are several popular datasets commonly used in statistical music composition. A dataset consisting of the entirety of J.S. Bach's four-voice chorales has been extensively studied under the lenses of algorithmic composition and reharmonization [1, 2, 13, 14]. Like NES-MDB, this dataset has a fixed number of voices and can be represented as a separated score (Fig. 1b), however it is small in size (\\(389\\) chorales) and lacks expressive information. Another popular dataset is Piano-midi.de, a corpus of classical piano from various composers [27]. This dataset has expressive timing and dynamics information but has heterogeneous time periods and only features solo piano music. Alongside Bach's chorales and the Piano-midi.de dataset, Boulanger-Lewandowski et al. (2012) standardized the Nottingham collection of folk tunes and MuseData library of orchestral and piano classical music into blended score format (Fig. 1a).\n\nSeveral other symbolic datasets exist containing both compositional and expressive characteristics. The Magaloff Corpus [10] consists of Disklavier recordings of a professional pianist playing the entirety of Chopin's solo piano works. The Lakh MIDI dataset [28] is the largest corpus of symbolic music assembled to date with nearly \\(200\\)k songs. While substantially larger than NES-MDB, the dataset has unconstrained polyphony, inconsistent expressive characteristics, and encompasses a wide variety of genres, instruments and time periods. Another paper trains neural networks on transcriptions of video game music [9], though their dataset only includes a handful of songs.\n\n### Statistical composition\n\nWhile most of the early research in algorithmic music composition focused on expert systems [25], statistical approaches have since become the predominant approach. Mozer (1994) trained RNNs on monophonic melodies using a formulation similar to Eq. 1, finding the composed results to compare favorably to those from a trigram model. Others have also explored monophonic melody generation with RNNs [26, 8]. Boulanger-Lewandowski et al. (2012) standardize the polyphonic prediction task for blended scores (Eq. 2), measuring performance of a multitude of classical baselines against RNNs [30], restricted Boltzmann machines [34], and NADEs [21] on polyphonic music datasets. Several papers [17, 35, 5] directly compare to their results. Statistical models of music have also been employed as symbolic priors to assist music transcription algorithms [2, 4, 24].\n\nProgressing towards models that _assist_ humans in composition, many researchers study models to create new harmonizations for existing musical material. Allan and Williams (2005) train HMMs to create new harmonizations for Bach chorales [1]. Hadjeres et al. (2017) train a bidirectional RNN model to consider past and future temporal context (Eq. 3) [13]. Along with [16, 31], they advocate for the usage of Gibbs sampling to generate music from complex graphical models.\n\n### Statistical performance\n\nMusicians perform music expressively by interpreting a performance with appropriate dynamics, timing and articulation. Computational models of expressive music performance seek to automatically assign such attributes to a score [36]. We point to several extensive surveys for information about the long history of rule-based systems [12, 7, 36, 20].\n\nSeveral statistical models of expressive performance have also been proposed. Raphael (2010) learns a graphical model that automates an accompanying orchestra for a soloist, operating on acoustic features rather than symbolic [29]. Flossmann et al. (2013) build a system to control velocity, articulation and timing of piano performances by learning a graphical model from a large symbolic corpus of human performances [11]. Xia et al. (2015) model the expressive timing and dynamics of piano duet performances using spectral methods [37]. Two end-to-end systems attempt to jointly learn the semantics of composition and expressive performance using RNNs [23, 33]. Malik and Ek (2017) train an RNN to generate velocity information given a musical score [22]. These approaches differ from our own in that they focus on piano performances rather than multi-instrumental music.\n\n## 6 Conclusion\n\nThe NES Music Database is a large corpus for examining multi-instrumental polyphonic composition and expressive performance generation. Compared to existing datasets, NES-MDB allows for examination of the \"full pipeline\" of music composition and performance. We parse the machine code of NES music into familiar formats (e.g. MIDI), eliminating the need for researchers to understand low-level details of the game system. We also provide an open-source tool which converts between the simpler formats and machine code, allowing researchers to audition their generated results as waveforms rendered by the NES. We hope that this dataset will facilitate a new paradigm of research on music generation--one that emphasizes the importance of expressive performance. To this end, we establish several baselines with reproducible evaluation methodology to encourage further investigation.\n\n## 7 Acknowledgements\n\nWe would like to thank Louis Pisha for invaluable advice on the technical details of this project.

This application offers high-quality instrumental sound \"online\" for \nmusic researchers, composers and professional audio studios. Studio Online is 3-tiered: a client applet \nruns in a standard Web browser and connects to a server hosted at IRCAM providing access to IRCAM \nsound transformation tools and to a large sound database. The uniqueness of Studio Online lies in its \nambition to serve the needs of scientific music research, contemporary composition and pedagogical \nactivity. The overall goal of the project was to provide an efficient and easy-to-use application for \ncontemporary audio research, composition and music production with the exclusive use of nonproprietary software tools and open standards.  \nKeywords: World Wide Web, Audio Databases, Sound Processing, Distributed Computing, Client/Server \nArchitectures, CORBA. \n1. Introduction \nIRCAM is a world renowned institution with specific competencies in acoustics and psychoacoustics of \ninstrumental sound, sound analysis and transformation software, and computer aided composition. As a \nmajor \ncenter \nof \nmusical \nresearch \nand \nproduction, \nit \nhas \na \nspecial \nmission \nof \narchiving/documenting/teaching contemporary musical use of technology. Additional artistic competence \nis input by visiting composers and musicologists. Besides IRCAMs departments for research and \ndocumentation, there is also a large department for music production and pedagogy.  \nAll of these departments are in constant need of high quality sound samples of musical instruments: the \nresearch departments need reference material for their various analyses, and the pedagogy needs specific \nsound samples for their music productions. Until recently, research and production had to laboriously \nproduce their own sound material every time they needed it, as there was no centralized collection of \ninstrumental sound readily available for their work. With Studio Online, high-quality instrumental sound \ncan now be instantly downloaded at any time to the personal computer or workstation on the office desk.  \nOne other problem tackled by Studio Online is the availability of advanced IRCAM sound processing \nsoftware for the different users in the institute (composers, researchers, engineers, students) who are \ntypically working on different computer hardware platforms (UNIX workstations, Macintoshes and PCs) \nand with different sound file formats (IRCAM's floating point format, Macintosh AIFF and AIFC, and \nMicrosoft's WAVE format). All these people need a unified, and somewhat more user-friendly access to \nthe power of IRCAM sound processing tools, without dwelling too much on their various versions, \nplatform dependencies, specificities and intricacies of their handling. Not all IRCAM sound processing \ntools have graphical frontends like SVP, FTS, Diphone or Patchwork do, and these are only available on \nspecific platforms (Audiosculpt, Diphone and Patchwork only on Macintoshes, jMAx only on some \nUNIXes).  \n\fJIM 99     -     124 \nThis was probably part of the motivation for IRCAM to respond to a call by the French Ministry of \nIndustry for proposals of a 3-years project on the \"Information Highway\", in 1996. After successful \ncompletion of the project by the end of 1998, IRCAM has at its disposal a versatile service for the various \nneeds of the inhouse staff, visiting composers, and external users (e.g. Forum members). Moreover, Studio \nOnline can be used by any computer connected to the internet. IRCAM technology can therefore be \nremotely accessed and evaluated from anywhere in the world. Studio Online permits an instantaneous, \naround-the-clock access to IRCAM sound archiving and processing power, a remotely configurable and \ncontrollable personal music studio for music professionals and laymen. Not only is it possible to \ndownload sound from the IRCAM database but also to upload own sound files to a private user space and \nhave them treated by IRCAM processing tools. According to the international character of the Internet, \nStudio Online is entirely bilingual (English and French). \nAfter a first phase of consolidation, the Studio Online Team formed under the management of Guillaume \nBallet and comprised developers Rolf W\u00f6hrmann (1997) and Rodolphe Bailly, Riccardo Borghesi and \nPeter Hoffmann (1998), artistic directors Joshua Fineberg (1997) and Fabien L\u00e9vy (1998), sound \nengineers Fran\u00e7ois Eckert (1997) and V\u00e9r\u00e8ne Gribonval (1998), post production engineers Antoine \nMercier, G\u00e9rard d'Elia (1997), and C\u00e9cile Lenoir (1998), and psychoacoustic research assistant Nicolas \nMisdariis, as well as a couple of interns. One other project, also supervised by Guillaume Ballet and \nfunded by the Ministry of Culture, specifically used Studio Online sounds for a popular Web site of \npedagogical vocation called \"Web Culture\". This site was developed by artistic director Fabrice Gu\u00e9dy \nand Web designer Guillaume Dimanche and is accessible at http://sol.ircam.fr/instruments/. \n2. Aims and Scope of the Project \nIt may be adequate to recall the ambitions and aims of the Studio Online Project as conceived by the \nStudio Online Team led by Guillaume Ballet [Ballet 1998]. One important technical ambition was the \nexclusive use of open standards (HTML, TCP/IP, CGI, CORBA, SQL) and non-proprietary technology \n(Java and C++ development under UNIX, standard CORBA tools1, JDBC). An integrated database \nclient/server development system could probably have facilitated the task, but only at the expense of \nprovider dependency, hardware/operating system limitations, or restricted availability by the internet \ncommunity (additional client software or even hardware etc.)2 For using Studio Online, there is no \ndedicated hardware necessary, no encryption involved, no specific client software, no installation of the \nclient, even no version control necessary, and no dependency on a specific carrier or provider. Everybody \ncan connect: all one needs is a working internet connection (some of them are even free of charge!) and an \nup-to-date internet browser, which is a piece of free and ubiquitous software. Everybody who has a \ncomputer can have that. \nOne important artistic ambition was to cover contemporary aspects of instrumental sound of specific \ninterest for contemporary electroacoustic composers and/or of specific pedagogical interest. For example, \nin Studio Online, most instruments (except those with a homogeneous timbre like the strings) are sampled \nin quarter tones. One can interactively search a large systematic collection of wind multiphonics, as well \nas some more 200 different 20th century playing modes and techniques as exotic as e.g. for woodwinds: \n\"jet whistle\", \"key clicks\", \"kiss sounds\", \"subtones\", breathing and singing through the instrument, and \nfor strings such as rubbing with the finger nail, knocking on the instrument's body, pressure bowing, \nartificial harmonics (strings), to name but a few [L\u00e9vy 1998]. Room acoustics are taken into account by \nproviding 6 channels for each sample: 2 near and 2 far stereo microphone pairs as well as a near and an \ninternal (built-in or contact) microphone. \n                                                           \n1Non-proprietary in the sense that the CORBA environment could be changed without any loss of \nfunctionality. The only exception is the \"Gatekeeper\" proxy server, which is an added product of the \nVisibroker ORB (see below). \n2In fact, there was not even a usable Java/CORBA development tool available at the time of the beginning \nof the project being able to create multi-tiered CORBA applications. \n\fJIM 99     -     125 \n3. The Architecture of Studio Online \nStudio Online has been conceived as a 3-tiered internet application. A client applet (the front tier) runs in \na Web browser and connects to a powerful server machine at IRCAM. Two server programs (the middle \ntier) connect the applet to a sound database as well as to a collection of audio processing tools (the back \ntier). In spite of being a Web application, on a fast machine and with a good Internet connection, Studio \nOnline almost feels like a local program. The previewing and downloading of sounds and other data (even \nsimultaneously) is managed by the browser so that the user can immediately go on working with the \ninterface while the browser manages the retrieval of the data (even of several sources simultaneously) in \nthe background. \nFor sound transfers, the applet uses the browser's capabilities of handling various multimedia data for \npreviewing (by spawning appropriate helper applications) or downloading to the user's local hard drive for \nlater use. All other communication is handled by an IIOP CORBA connection through a special proxy \nserver, Visibroker's \"Gatekeeper\", which works around some of the applet's sandbox security restrictions. \nFor example, it permits connecting to a different server interface than from where the applet was loaded, \nand it holds a callback connection allowing the server to recontact the applet on asynchronous events. (We \nuse the callback feature to notify the user upon arrival of sounds uploaded to IRCAM and to constantly \ncheck the liveness of the client applet during the session.) For details, see [Hoffmann 1998]. \nStudio Online has two main server processes: one server is written in Java and manages all session \noriented aspects. Another server is written in C++ and manages the coordination of the various audio \ntransactions like sound transformation, format conversion and downloading. Both servers are of course \nfully multithreaded and so handle multiple sessions and requests concurrently. The session server works \nbetween the client applet and the database containing all informations about user login and preferences \nand the sound taxinomy of Studio Online. The transaction server works between the client applet and \nseveral IRCAM sound processing and format conversion tools as well as a number of other tools for \ngenerating archives, checking the user's disk quota, etc. \nThe CORBA middleware enables a direct communication among objects distributed between the client \napplet and the two server programs as if it were just one single object-oriented program. The object \ndistribution is not only perfectly transparent to the user but also to some degree to the programmer, a fact \nwhich allows much flexibility in design and implementation of a distributed C/S application. \nThe session server connects to the database via a JDBC bridge. This server program stands between the \ndatabase and the client applet and provides a convenient functional layer of abstraction to the SQL \ndatabase communication. The applet, for its part, presents to the user an even more intuitive visual \ninterface for navigation within the sound taxinomy stored in the database. In an iterative, interactive \nprocess, the user is invited to incrementally refine his/her choices on a number of aspects of the sound \n(instrument, playing mode, pitch, etc.) while the interface constantly updates in order to present to the user \nthe number and the aspects of the sounds that are still available. Behind the scenes, every choice of the \nuser in the interface is converted by the applet into a request over the internet to the session server which \nsends a corresponding SQL query to the database, evaluates the result and returns the information \nnecessary in order to update the applet interface. Thanks to an efficient implementation of the remote \nquerying process, the interactive sound selection game almost feels as if one had to do with a local \ninstallation (provided the Internet access is not too bad). \nThe actual sound data are not stored in the database itself but on a large RAID disk array. It was found \nthat it was easier to handle them on a file system, as no prediction could be obtained at the time of how the \ndatabase would eventually behave when loaded with hundreds of Gigabyte of data. In addition, we needed \ndirect access to the sounds during development time and, last but not least, the database BLOB primitives \nwere bugged in Oracle 8. So the database only references the sounds by an identification number which is \npassed by the applet to the transaction server. The transaction server dynamically creates Perl scripts \nwhich contain the sequence of command lines for various tools accessing the sound files on the RAID file \nsystem and converting them according to the user's preferences concerning the microphone configuration \n(near-mono, internal, stereo-near, stereo-far and their left and right channels), the preferred sound file \nformat, sampling rate, quantization and the volume compression of the sounds. On sound download by the \nbrowser, the Perl scripts generated by the transaction server are executed through a CGI invocation and \ntransparently convert the desired sound \"on the fly\" according to the user's specification. The user's \npreferences are configurable at any time and persistent between different sessions.  \n\fJIM 99     -     126 \nStudio Online sounds have not been subjected to any audio compression with possible data loss. The main \nconcern was 100% uncompronized sound quality, and we did not want to trade it off against accelerated \ndownloading time. It is also in order to ease access and to avoid dependency on proprietary compression \nformats. \n \nFigure 1: The Studio Online 3 Distributed Architecture \n4. Related Work \nOther projects have been and are being undertaken around the world to use the Internet as an easy and \ndirect way to access large sound collections. EastWest (www.soundsonline.com) serves 16 bit, 44.1k, \nWAVE and AIFF sound (over 20,000 instrumental sound samples). Search is done by standard HTML \nforms on categories and keywords. The sound can be previewed in Real Audio. Download is accelerated \nby E-magic ZIP compression (30% without data loss) after online payment. However, sound quality is not \nabove standard CD quality. In comparison to Studio Online's 120,000 sounds, the repertoire is limited. \nSound Dogs (www.sounddogs.com) serves over 60,000 sounds and special effects for the cinema (more \nthan 110 GB of data). Search is by categories and keywords, but there is no sound preview yet. \nDownloading is not interactive at all, for sound is sent by e-mail. The sounds are of a high quality (up to \n24 bit, 48k sampling rate) and many different formats are available. These services, however, are not \ninteractive as Studio Online is in the sense that an HTML request is sent and then the user waits for the \nanswer. In Studio Online, client-server interaction is immediate and two-way. \n\"Studio On Line\" (www.audiosoft.com), not to be confounded with Studio Online, serves 16 bit 44.1k \nsounds and samples for post production studios and professionals. Specific hardware is needed to use this \nservice: a dedicated Client Computer of a specific brand is preconfigured with a Digital Video Broadcast \nCard, which decrypts audio data from a dedicated satellite connection (Astra Net) in real time. The \nimmediate access (faster than Studio Online, which is not real time) must be paid, in addition to the \nrenting of the service, by proprietary technology and dependency on a specific connection service. \n\fJIM 99     -     127 \nNone of the mentioned sites are really musical sites with an artistic vocation but commercial delivery \nservices of some big players in the audio and multimedia market. There are no sound transformations \noffered as in Studio Online, no interactive navigation on the content of the sound databases or graphical \ncontrol of parameter configurations as there are in Studio Online like Break Point Functions, compression \ngraphs, and the like, which are only possible through Java programming.  \n5. A Typical Session With Studio Online \nOne should not try to connect to Studio Online with an outmoded computer and obsolete browser \nsoftware. Required is a fast Pentium or comparable processing power, sufficient memory on top of what is \nalready consumed by the operating system and browser software (which is much), Microsoft Explorer \n4.01 (build no. 4.72.xxxx.xx) or Netscape Communicator 4.5.  \n5.1. Startup \nOn visiting the Studio Online Web page containing the client applet (http://sol.ircam.fr/external/joba) a \nnew browser window opens, the Java Virtual Machine starts up and the compressed Java archive (ca. 3 \nMB) is loaded. It takes additional time until the classes (a couple of hundreds) are verified by the Java \nsecurity system and instantiated. This can take a while, and both Netscape and Explorer do not really \nindicate the progress of this procedure, so one must be patient. (Netscape seems almost frozen during this \nperiod, while with Explorer one can easily go on surfing in another browser window.) If the user has \nconfigured a sufficiently large Browser cache (10 MB, say) to keep all the loaded Java classes on the local \nmachine, the applet will start up within seconds the next time. This is because the browser then just checks \nif the local classes are up to date and if so, verification and download of code is skipped. \n5.2. Selecting Sounds \nThe applet first presents the user a login screen where he/she can type a user name and a password. (On a \nfirst visit, the user just enters a user name and a password of his/her own choice in order to identify \nhim/herself on later logins.) On pressing the login button, the applet instantiates the ORB classes, connects \nto the IRCAM server and opens a session. The user preferences of the last session are retrieved (default is \nAIFF/16 bit/44.1 kHz as sound format and English as language). The user is first presented with a \"sound \nselector\" screen which actually is a graphical frontend to the database containing the sound taxinomy. The \nuser selects the attributes of the desired sounds among a number of categories (instrument, playing mode, \ndynamic, pitch(es), octave(s), channel configuration, etc.) and sees how the selector interface updates in \norder to show the choices that remain, until the number of hits is reduced to less than or equal to 24 \nsounds (e.g. a quarter tone octave). \n5.3. Managing Sounds: Downloading, Uploading, and Transforming \nThe user can then load the set of these sounds into the \"sound manager\". This is a directory view on the \nuser's workspace and the central part of the application. From here the user can transform selected sounds \nand recursively create subdirectories containing the results of these transformations (which we call \n\"productions\": the resulting sound file(s), some analysis files, the parameters of the transformation and a \nlog file). The directory structure thus reflects the transformation \"history\" of an original sound. The \ntransformation result is automatically previewed by the audio helper application the user has configured in \nthe browser's preferences as soon as the transformation is done. \nAn interesting chain of transformations, for example, is to split off the noise part of a noisy instrumental \nsound (e.g. a sul ponticello on a double bass or a flutter tongue on a trombone) with additive resynthesis, \nto transpose it two octaves higher and to time stretch it by a factor of four. The result is a most interesting \nsound which has lost almost all similarity to an instrumental sound, while it still benefits from the \ncomplexity and richness of a natural acoustic phenomenon. The user can also be interested in \ndownloading the spectral analysis data, and use them on his/her own computer by displaying them \ngraphically with standard software or even inputting them into his/her own software.  \nThe user can upload his/her own sounds up to 20 MB per file to a private directory on the IRCAM server. \nWAVE, AIFF, AIFC (uncompressed) and IRCAM floating point/short sample sound file formats are \nrecognized. These sounds can be transformed in the same way as the database sounds and downloaded \n\fJIM 99     -     128 \nagain, or left on the server for the next session with Studio Online. Up to 300 MB of disk space can be \nclaimed by the user. The transformation results are stored on the server in IRCAM floating point format in \norder to preserve a maximum of sound quality, so this quota might be reached after some transformations \nof lengthy sound files. In this case, the user is invited to delete some unwanted results before he/she can \nproceed producing new sound data or uploading more sounds. \n5.4. Configuring User Preferences: Language, Sound File Format, and Compression of Sound \nDynamics \nAt any time, the user can reconfigure his/her preferences in order to adapt to his/her specific local \nenvironment (typically PC/MAC/UNIX), linguistic background (English or French speaking), and audio \nsystem (does it support Studio Online's extreme 24 bit dynamic resolution?). Pianissimo sounds from \nStudio Online can be extremely weak when played back on a 16 bit audio system, so we devised a \ngraphical static compressor which permits to directly define a compression curve (linear compression and \nan optional constant offset) to adapt 24 bit dynamics (about 144 dB) to, say, the 16 bit range (about 96 \ndB). All of these configurations are immediately taken into account. For example, as soon as the user \nswitches e.g. from English to French, the configuration interface itself becomes French at once (with all \naccents, of course), as does the rest of the client applet. The same holds for sound transactions: if the user \nchanges from AIFF to WAVE, the next sound downloaded comes as WAVE with Mime Type \n\"audio/wav\", and spawns the corresponding application configured in the browser's preferences.  \n5.5. Search by Psychoacoustic Similarity \nThis interface complements the systematic choice of the sound selector interface. It is a very powerful \nsearch engine through the whole database, across instruments, playing modes, pitches, etc. by \npreprocessed comparison of spectrally analyzed content only. Surprising results can be obtained and \nsounds detected that one would not have found by looking up the sound taxinomy [Hoffmann/Misdariis \n1998]. \nThis interface has been made much more intuitively by the introduction of evocative terms and the \nconcentration on 3 major perceptual categories of sound: brilliance, richness, and attack. Additional \nconstraints can be requested by the user on spectral energy and/or pitch, restricting the hits to a certain \ndistance in these parameters, and a distinction between percussive and non-percussive sounds can be \nenforced. Up to 50 found sounds can be compared to the original sound and added to the sound manager \nfor further treatment.  \n6. Technical Data of Studio Online 3.0 \nStudio Online 3.0 is what could be called an \"Internet Killer Application\" [Orfali/Harkey 1998]. It makes \nuse of the latest achievements in distributed computing to connect Internet clients to a sound server and to \nprovide a sophisticated graphical user interface for the remote query process, the sound transformations, \nthe remote managing of the sound files, and the retrieval of the sound data. After trying standard Internet \ntechnology like HTML pages and CGI scripts, it was found that only a distributed Client/Server \narchitecture could satisfactorily respond to the needs of interactively navigating in a large sound taxinomy, \nproviding a session oriented workspace, supporting intuitive graphical controls and diagrams, and \nallowing the user to configure his/her own persistent preferences of sound format, language, compression \nlevel, etc. [cf., e.g. Weisbecker/Bauer 1998]. \nThe version of Java used is Java 1.1.3, with the JFC/Swing 1.03 layer on the client side. The ORB \nsoftware used is Visibroker for Java 3.2 and Visibroker for C++ 3.1. The database used is the Oracle \n8.0.3.0 database accessed by JDBC 8.0.4.0.6 Level 2 drivers. \nThe Web server is Apache 1.2.4, and the dynamical sound conversion scripts are launched by CGI calls \nwith Perl 5.0.3. The conversion programs are IRCAM's STtools toolkit (updated and completed by the \nStudio Online Team). \nThe server machine is a Sun Microsystems Enterprise UltraSparc 3000 running Solaris 2.5.1. \n\fJIM 99     -     129 \nThe disk array is a Sun Microsystems Raid RSM 2000, configured Raid 5, with 31 disks \u00e0 9 GB each, \nplus two hot spare and a cold spare disk. This gives us, after formatting, a usable disk space of 190 GB. \nThe database disk (1 HD)is fully mirrored with RAID 0+1.  \nThe sound total is 113.823 sounds with 6 tracks each, sampled with 48k, 24 bit (ca. 130 GB of data, \nwhich correspond ca. 12 days of continuous listening). \n7. New Features in Studio Online 3.0 \nDuring 1997, brilliant developer Rolf W\u00f6hrmann created, in close collaboration with Guillaume Ballet, \nversions 1 through 2.6, gradually fixing the architecture as described above [W\u00f6hrmann 1997, 1999]. This \nversion was a fully working, albeit somewhat restricted prototype which already served the needs of a \nconstantly growing user group. During 1998, the sound database was completed to 16 instruments by the \nrecording and editing team, and the software system was enhanced, completed, and tuned by the new \ndevelopment team. Startup of the client applet was optimized by loading all classes \"on demand\". Full \nsupport of the Windows platform was added (WAVE sound file format, support of the Explorer way to \nhandle multimedia data, etc.), sound transformations became stereo and could be indefinitely chained. The \nclient interface was completely redesigned, became fully resizable and uniform on all platforms \n(Swing/JFC look and feel), graphically much enhanced by the hierarchical directory view in the sound \nmanager with indication of the download size, graphical break point function editors for time-dependent \ntransformations, menus and tab controls instead of buttons, etc. Many minor improvements were done to \nthe client, the servers, and the various administration tools. Some small but useful features were added, \nlike e.g. the progress messages during transformation processes and the possibility to abort them, the \npossibility to download multiple sounds in one archive file or to automatically order sounds on CD, and \nautomatic dithering of 8 bit sound. More information is to be found in the release notes [SOL]. \n8. Some Problems Encountered \nWe had much trouble when upgrading from the Java 1.0 AWT to the Swing/JFC library. All Swing GUI \naction is done in the user thread which blocks on synchronous remote method invocations. Since we \ncannot predict the response time of such remote calls we had to program our own threading policy in \norder to refresh the user interface during a remote call. We finally decided to launch a thread for each \nremote connection. But then we had the difficulty of synchronizing these threads, especially in order to \nprevent a user nervously clicking on the interface and flooding the server with newly opened threads (we \nrealized this problem when during testing, our JDBC drivers simply blocked the whole system without any \nerror message after we hectically clicked some hundred times in the interface). This considerably \ncomplicated the programming of the selector interface. We would have wished the Swing/JFC layer to \nimplement the same threading policy as the old AWT.  \nWe also had much trouble with a bug in the Gatekeeper which blocked without any error indication after a \ncouple of days. I shall not mention the dozens of minor bugs in the various Swing/JFC betas and other \nused software (especially our Java development tool). But the most annoying bugs and deficiencies were \nfound in the browser software: no resizing of the applet in Netscape, no upload of sounds possible with \nthe Explorer on the Mac, to name only the most flagrant ones. Microsoft did not correctly port their \ncurrent Java Virtual Machine to the MAC, and the Apple MRJ is so sloppily implemented that one has to \ninvent dozens of workarounds in order to be able to use it at all. See [SOL] for details. \n9. Future Work \nStudio Online is actually a project designed for the future. We used the latest technology available at the \ntime, much to the disenchantment of some of our users which were not able or ready to upgrade to the \nlatest Web Browser versions with a Java Virtual Machines fully compliant to the Java 1.1 API. We \nneeded the new Java version as well as Sunsoft's Swing/JFC classes for the advanced graphics in the \napplet's user interface. We even would have preferred to migrate to Java 1.2 if it had been available at the \ntime, for it integrates the ca. 2 MB of JFC class code that have to be downloaded on the first use of Studio \nOnline. When using Nescape Communicator which already integrates Visibroker's CORBA classes (albeit \n\fJIM 99     -     130 \nin an older version), the applet could even shrink again to its old size of some hundred KB (which at the \ntime gave it the nickname \"JORBA\" for \"just one really big applet\"3). Java 1.2 would also invite to \nreplace the current CGI driven downloading and playing of audio data by an integrated solution using (an \nimproved form of) the Java Media Framework, with its support of many more file formats, etc. \nDespite its success, Studio Online should be considered only the beginning of a much more ambitious \nproject of internetworked sound processing, transparently distributed sound storage and access, and the \ndesign of component software for music purposes. It has been shown that Studio Online technology can \nsolve some of the problems of a large and historically grown research institution as IRCAM, but there is \nstill a long way to go.  \nFor example, the current integration of IRCAM sound processing tools works by command line wrapping \nwhich is a tedious, limited and suboptimal way to expose them to remote use. There are 3 to 8 separate \nprocesses launched per transformation: the various sound conversion tools to feed the source sound into \nand to retrieve the processed sound from a command pipeline, the splitting of stereo sound into mono \nchannels for the Additive engine which itself is but a script executing command lines. Under these \nconditions, it was already an achievement to implement such basic remote controls as a gauge to monitor \nthe progress of a transformation and a button to remotely abort the transformation process!  \nInstead of launching shells executing assembled command line strings, the sound processing engines \nshould be encapsulated as multithreaded CORBA servers. Once there will be stable versions and welldefined control interfaces of these engines, it will be much easier to develop intuitive and fault-tolerant \nintegrated systems using them. It would then be feasible to develop unified graphic interfaces for expert \nconfiguration of these sound processing engines which have remarkable possibilities if used in advanced \nmode. \nStudio Online should develop into a testbed for advanced tool integration, sound internetworking, and \naudio research with the help of distributed objects. There is no lack of ideas: projects have been conceived \nof treating the integration of distributed databases, advanced content search in audio documents (instead \nof the current table lookup), integration of more IRCAM software, etc.  \n10. Conclusion \nStudio Online has been one of the few realizations answering the call for projects on the \"Information \nHighway\" that have been successfully completed in time. This fact makes it all the more deplorable that \nthere has not been any kind of immediate follow-up project. Aside from the fact that much more \nfunctionality could have been added to and on top of Studio Online, it is with the expertise gained during \nthis project that even more interesting inter/intranet applications of distributed processing for musical \npurposes could have been envisaged.  \n \n \nReferences \n \n[Ballet 1998] Guillaume Ballet, Vincent Puig, Hugues Vinet, Projet Studio en ligne, Rapport final, \nIRCAM, Nov. 1998, unpublished. \n[Ballet 1998] Guillaume Ballet, Rapport d'avancement du projet Studio en ligne I, II, III, \nhttp://sol.ircam.fr/~ballet/rapports/* and http://sol.ircam.fr/docs/sol3.0/ \n[Hoffmann 1998] Peter Hoffmann, Studio Online III: Distribution and Interaction.

This application offers high-quality instrumental sound \"online\" for music researchers, composers and professional audio studios. Studio Online is 3-tiered: a client applet runs in a standard Web browser and connects to a server hosted at IRCAM providing access to IRCAM sound transformation tools and to a large sound database. The uniqueness of Studio Online lies in its ambition to serve the needs of scientific music research, contemporary composition and pedagogical activity. The overall goal of the project was to provide an efficient and easy-to-use application for contemporary audio research, composition and music production with the exclusive use of non-proprietary software tools and open standards.\n\nKeywords: World Wide Web, Audio Databases, Sound Processing, Distributed Computing, Client/Server Architectures, CORBA.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nIRCAM is a world renowned institution with specific competencies in acoustics and psychoacoustics of instrumental sound, sound analysis and transformation software, and computer aided composition. As a major center of musical research and production, it has a special mission of archiving/documenting/teaching contemporary musical use of technology. Additional artistic competence is input by visiting composers and musicologists. Besides IRCAMs departments for research and documentation, there is also a large department for music production and pedagogy.\n\nAll of these departments are in constant need of high quality sound samples of musical instruments: the research departments need reference material for their various analyses, and the pedagogy needs specific sound samples for their music productions. Until recently, research and production had to laboriously produce their own sound material every time they needed it, as there was no centralized collection of instrumental sound readily available for their work. With Studio Online, high-quality instrumental sound can now be instantly downloaded at any time to the personal computer or workstation on the office desk.\n\nOne other problem tackled by Studio Online is the availability of advanced IRCAM sound processing software for the different users in the institute (composers, researchers, engineers, students) who are typically working on different computer hardware platforms (UNIX workstations, Macintoshes and PCs) and with different sound file formats (IRCAM's floating point format, Macintosh AIFF and AIFC, and Microsoft's WAVE format). All these people need a unified, and somewhat more user-friendly access to the power of IRCAM sound processing tools, without dwelling too much on their various versions, platform dependencies, specificities and intricacies of their handling. Not all IRCAM sound processing tools have graphical frontends like SVP, FTS, Diphone or Patchwork do, and these are only available on specific platforms (Audiosculpt, Diphone and Patchwork only on Macintoshes, jMAx only on some UNIXes).\n\nThis was probably part of the motivation for IRCAM to respond to a call by the French Ministry of Industry for proposals of a 3-years project on the \"Information Highway\", in 1996. After successful completion of the project by the end of 1998, IRCAM has at its disposal a versatile service for the various needs of the inhouse staff, visiting composers, and external users (e.g. Forum members). Moreover, Studio Online can be used by any computer connected to the internet. IRCAM technology can therefore be remotely accessed and evaluated from anywhere in the world. Studio Online permits an instantaneous, around-the-clock access to IRCAM sound archiving and processing power, a remotely configurable and controllable personal music studio for music professionals and laymen. Not only is it possible to download sound from the IRCAM database but also to upload own sound files to a private user space and have them treated by IRCAM processing tools. According to the international character of the Internet, Studio Online is entirely bilingual (English and French).\n\nAfter a first phase of consolidation, the Studio Online Team formed under the management of Guillaume Ballet and comprised developers Rolf Wohrmann (1997) and Rodolphe Bailly, Riccardo Borghesi and Peter Hoffmann (1998), artistic directors Joshua Fineberg (1997) and Fabien Levy (1998), sound engineers Francois Eckert (1997) and Verene Gribonval (1998), post production engineers Antoine Mercier, Gerard Elia (1997), and Cecile Lenoir (1998), and psychoacoustic research assistant Nicolas Misdariis, as well as a couple of interns. One other project, also supervised by Guillaume Ballet and funded by the Ministry of Culture, specifically used Studio Online sounds for a popular Web site of pedagogical vocation called \"Web Culture\". This site was developed by artistic director Fabrice Guedy and Web designer Guillaume Dimanche and is accessible at [http://sol.ircam.fr/instruments/](http://sol.ircam.fr/instruments/).\n\n## 2 Aims and Scope of the Project\n\nIt may be adequate to recall the ambitions and aims of the Studio Online Project as conceived by the Studio Online Team led by Guillaume Ballet [Ballet 1998]. One important technical ambition was the exclusive use of open standards (HTML, TCP/IP, CGI, CORBA, SQL) and non-proprietary technology (Java and C++ development under UNIX, standard CORBA tools1, JDBC). An integrated database client/server development system could probably have facilitated the task, but only at the expense of provider dependency, hardware/operating system limitations, or restricted availability by the internet community (additional client software or even hardware etc.)2 For using Studio Online, there is no dedicated hardware necessary, no encryption involved, no specific client software, no installation of the client, even no version control necessary, and no dependency on a specific carrier or provider. Everybody can connect: all one needs is a working internet connection (some of them are even free of charge!) and an up-to-date internet browser, which is a piece of free and ubiquitous software. Everybody who has a computer can have that.\n\nFootnote 1: Non-proprietary in the sense that the CORBA environment could be changed without any loss of functionality. The only exception is the \u201dGatekeeper\u201d proxy server, which is an added product of the Visibroker ORB (see below).\n\nFootnote 2: In fact, there was not even a usable Java/CORBA development tool available at the time of the beginning of the project being able to create multi-tiered CORBA applications.\n\nOne important artistic ambition was to cover contemporary aspects of instrumental sound of specific interest for contemporary electroacoustic composers and/or of specific pedagogical interest. For example, in Studio Online, most instruments (except those with a homogeneous timbre like the strings) are sampled in quarter tones. One can interactively search a large systematic collection of wind multiphonics, as well as some more 200 different 20th century playing modes and techniques as exotic as e.g. for woodwinds: \"jet whistle\", \"key clicks\", \"kiss sounds\", \"subtones\", breathing and singing through the instrument, and for strings such as rubbing with the finger nail, knocking on the instrument's body, pressure bowing, artificial harmonics (strings), to name but a few [Levy 1998]. Room acoustics are taken into account by providing 6 channels for each sample: 2 near and 2 far stereo microphone pairs as well as a near and an internal (built-in or contact) microphone.\n\n## 3 The Architecture of Studio Online\n\nStudio Online has been conceived as a 3-tiered internet application. A client applet (the front tier) runs in a Web browser and connects to a powerful server machine at IRCAM. Two server programs (the middle tier) connect the applet to a sound database as well as to a collection of audio processing tools (the back tier). In spite of being a Web application, on a fast machine and with a good Internet connection, Studio Online almost feels like a local program. The previewing and downloading of sounds and other data (even simultaneously) is managed by the browser so that the user can immediately go on working with the interface while the browser manages the retrieval of the data (even of several sources simultaneously) in the background.\n\nFor sound transfers, the applet uses the browser's capabilities of handling various multimedia data for previewing (by spawning appropriate helper applications) or downloading to the user's local hard drive for later use. All other communication is handled by an IIOP CORBA connection through a special proxy server, Visibroker's \"Gatekeeper\", which works around some of the applet's sandbox security restrictions. For example, it permits connecting to a different server interface than from where the applet was loaded, and it holds a callback connection allowing the server to recontact the applet on asynchronous events. (We use the callback feature to notify the user upon arrival of sounds uploaded to IRCAM and to constantly check the liveness of the client applet during the session.) For details, see [10].\n\nStudio Online has two main server processes: one server is written in Java and manages all session oriented aspects. Another server is written in C++ and manages the coordination of the various audio transactions like sound transformation, format conversion and downloading. Both servers are of course fully multithreaded and so handle multiple sessions and requests concurrently. The session server works between the client applet and the database containing all informations about user login and preferences and the sound taxonomy of Studio Online. The transaction server works between the client applet and several IRCAM sound processing and format conversion tools as well as a number of other tools for generating archives, checking the user's disk quota, etc.\n\nThe CORBA middleware enables a direct communication among objects distributed between the client applet and the two server programs as if it were just one single object-oriented program. The object distribution is not only perfectly transparent to the user but also to some degree to the programmer, a fact which allows much flexibility in design and implementation of a distributed C/S application.\n\nThe session server connects to the database via a JDBC bridge. This server program stands between the database and the client applet and provides a convenient functional layer of abstraction to the SQL database communication. The applet, for its part, presents to the user an even more intuitive visual interface for navigation within the sound taxonomy stored in the database. In an iterative, interactive process, the user is invited to incrementally refine his/her choices on a number of aspects of the sound (instrument, playing mode, pitch, etc.) while the interface constantly updates in order to present to the user the number and the aspects of the sounds that are still available. Behind the scenes, every choice of the user in the interface is converted by the applet into a request over the internet to the session server which sends a corresponding SQL query to the database, evaluates the result and returns the information necessary in order to update the applet interface. Thanks to an efficient implementation of the remote querying process, the interactive sound selection game almost feels as if one had to do with a local installation (provided the Internet access is not too bad).\n\nThe actual sound data are not stored in the database itself but on a large RAID disk array. It was found that it was easier to handle them on a file system, as no prediction could be obtained at the time of how the database would eventually behave when loaded with hundreds of Gigabyte of data. In addition, we needed direct access to the sounds during development time and, last but not least, the database BLOB primitives were bugged in Oracle 8. So the database only references the sounds by an identification number which is passed by the applet to the transaction server. The transaction server dynamically creates Perl scripts which contain the sequence of command lines for various tools accessing the sound files on the RAID file system and converting them according to the user's preferences concerning the microphone configuration (near-mono, internal, stereo-near, stereo-far and their left and right channels), the preferred sound file format, sampling rate, quantization and the volume compression of the sounds. On sound download by the browser, the Perl scripts generated by the transaction server are executed through a CGI invocation and transparently convert the desired sound \"on the fly\" according to the user's specification. The user's preferences are configurable at any time and persistent between different sessions.\n\nStudio Online sounds have not been subjected to any audio compression with possible data loss. The main concern was 100% uncompromised sound quality, and we did not want to trade it off against accelerated downloading time. It is also in order to ease access and to avoid dependency on proprietary compression formats.\n\n## 4 Related Work\n\nOther projects have been and are being undertaken around the world to use the Internet as an easy and direct way to access large sound collections. EastWest (www.soundsonline.com) serves 16 bit, 44.1k, WAVE and AIFF sound (over 20,000 instrumental sound samples). Search is done by standard HTML forms on categories and keywords. The sound can be previewed in Real Audio. Download is accelerated by E-magic ZIP compression (30% without data loss) after online payment. However, sound quality is not above standard CD quality. In comparison to Studio Online's 120,000 sounds, the repertoire is limited.\n\nSound Dogs (www.sounddogs.com) serves over 60,000 sounds and special effects for the cinema (more than 110 GB of data). Search is by categories and keywords, but there is no sound preview yet. Downloading is not interactive at all, for sound is sent by e-mail. The sounds are of a high quality (up to 24 bit, 48k sampling rate) and many different formats are available. These services, however, are not interactive as Studio Online is in the sense that an HTML request is sent and then the user waits for the answer. In Studio Online, client-server interaction is immediate and two-way.\n\n\"Studio On Line\" (www.audiosoft.com), not to be confounded with Studio Online, serves 16 bit 44.1k sounds and samples for post production studios and professionals. Specific hardware is needed to use this service: a dedicated Client Computer of a specific brand is preconfigured with a Digital Video Broadcast Card, which decrypts audio data from a dedicated satellite connection (Astra Net) in real time. The immediate access (faster than Studio Online, which is not real time) must be paid, in addition to the renting of the service, by proprietary technology and dependency on a specific connection service.\n\nFigure 1: The Studio Online 3 Distributed Architecture\n\nNone of the mentioned sites are really musical sites with an artistic vocation but commercial delivery services of some big players in the audio and multimedia market. There are no sound transformations offered as in Studio Online, no interactive navigation on the content of the sound databases or graphical control of parameter configurations as there are in Studio Online like Break Point Functions, compression graphs, and the like, which are only possible through Java programming.\n\n## 5 A Typical Session With Studio Online\n\nOne should not try to connect to Studio Online with an outmoded computer and obsolete browser software. Required is a fast Pentium or comparable processing power, sufficient memory on top of what is already consumed by the operating system and browser software (which is much), Microsoft Explorer 4.01 (build no. 4.72.xxxx.xx) or Netscape Communicator 4.5.\n\n### Startup\n\nOn visiting the Studio Online Web page containing the client applet ([http://sol.ircam.fr/external/joba](http://sol.ircam.fr/external/joba)) a new browser window opens, the Java Virtual Machine starts up and the compressed Java archive (ca. 3 MB) is loaded. It takes additional time until the classes (a couple of hundreds) are verified by the Java security system and instantiated. This can take a while, and both Netscape and Explorer do not really indicate the progress of this procedure, so one must be patient. (Netscape seems almost frozen during this period, while with Explorer one can easily go on surfing in another browser window.) If the user has configured a sufficiently large Browser cache (10 MB, say) to keep all the loaded Java classes on the local machine, the applet will start up within seconds the next time. This is because the browser then just checks if the local classes are up to date and if so, verification and download of code is skipped.\n\n### Selecting Sounds\n\nThe applet first presents the user a login screen where he/she can type a user name and a password. (On a first visit, the user just enters a user name and a password of his/her own choice in order to identify him/herself on later logins.) On pressing the login button, the applet instantiates the ORB classes, connects to the IRCAM server and opens a session. The user preferences of the last session are retrieved (default is AIFF/16 bit/44.1 kHz as sound format and English as language). The user is first presented with a \"sound selector\" screen which actually is a graphical frontend to the database containing the sound taxonomy. The user selects the attributes of the desired sounds among a number of categories (instrument, playing mode, dynamic, pitch(es), octave(s), channel configuration, etc.) and sees how the selector interface updates in order to show the choices that remain, until the number of hits is reduced to less than or equal to 24 sounds (e.g. a quarter tone octave).\n\n### Managing Sounds: Downloading, Uploading, and Transforming\n\nThe user can then load the set of these sounds into the \"sound manager\". This is a directory view on the user's workspace and the central part of the application. From here the user can transform selected sounds and recursively create subdirectories containing the results of these transformations (which we call \"productions\": the resulting sound file(s), some analysis files, the parameters of the transformation and a log file). The directory structure thus reflects the transformation \"history\" of an original sound. The transformation result is automatically previewed by the audio helper application the user has configured in the browser's preferences as soon as the transformation is done.\n\nAn interesting chain of transformations, for example, is to split off the noise part of a noisy instrumental sound (e.g. a sul ponticello on a double bass or a flutter tongue on a trombone) with additive resynthesis, to transpose it two octaves higher and to time stretch it by a factor of four. The result is a most interesting sound which has lost almost all similarity to an instrumental sound, while it still benefits from the complexity and richness of a natural acoustic phenomenon. The user can also be interested in downloading the spectral analysis data, and use them on his/her own computer by displaying them graphically with standard software or even inputting them into his/her own software.\n\nThe user can upload his/her own sounds up to 20 MB per file to a private directory on the IRCAM server. WAVE, AIFF, AIFC (uncompressed) and IRCAM floating point/short sample sound file formats are recognized. These sounds can be transformed in the same way as the database sounds and downloadedagain, or left on the server for the next session with Studio Online. Up to 300 MB of disk space can be claimed by the user. The transformation results are stored on the server in IRCAM floating point format in order to preserve a maximum of sound quality, so this quota might be reached after some transformations of lengthy sound files. In this case, the user is invited to delete some unwanted results before he/she can proceed producing new sound data or uploading more sounds.\n\n### 5.4. Configuring User Preferences: Language, Sound File Format, and Compression of Sound Dynamics\n\nAt any time, the user can reconfigure his/her preferences in order to adapt to his/her specific local environment (typically PC/MAC/UNIX), linguistic background (English or French speaking), and audio system (does it support Studio Online's extreme 24 bit dynamic resolution?). Pianissimo sounds from Studio Online can be extremely weak when played back on a 16 bit audio system, so we devised a graphical static compressor which permits to directly define a compression curve (linear compression and an optional constant offset) to adapt 24 bit dynamics (about 144 dB) to, say, the 16 bit range (about 96 dB). All of these configurations are immediately taken into account. For example, as soon as the user switches e.g. from English to French, the configuration interface itself becomes French at once (with all accents, of course), as does the rest of the client applet. The same holds for sound transactions: if the user changes from AIFF to WAVE, the next sound downloaded comes as WAVE with Mime Type \"audio/wav\", and spawns the corresponding application configured in the browser's preferences.\n\n### 5.5. Search by Psychoacoustic Similarity\n\nThis interface complements the systematic choice of the sound selector interface. It is a very powerful search engine through the whole database, across instruments, playing modes, pitches, etc. by preprocessed comparison of spectrally analyzed content only. Surprising results can be obtained and sounds detected that one would not have found by looking up the sound taxonomy [Hoffmann/Misdariis 1998].\n\nThis interface has been made much more intuitively by the introduction of evocative terms and the concentration on 3 major perceptual categories of sound: brilliance, richness, and attack. Additional constraints can be requested by the user on spectral energy and/or pitch, restricting the hits to a certain distance in these parameters, and a distinction between percussive and non-percussive sounds can be enforced. Up to 50 found sounds can be compared to the original sound and added to the sound manager for further treatment.\n\n## 6. Technical Data of Studio Online 3.0\n\nStudio Online 3.0 is what could be called an \"Internet Killer Application\" [Orfali/Harkey 1998]. It makes use of the latest achievements in distributed computing to connect Internet clients to a sound server and to provide a sophisticated graphical user interface for the remote query process, the sound transformations, the remote managing of the sound files, and the retrieval of the sound data. After trying standard Internet technology like HTML pages and CGI scripts, it was found that only a distributed Client/Server architecture could satisfactorily respond to the needs of interactively navigating in a large sound taxonomy, providing a session oriented workspace, supporting intuitive graphical controls and diagrams, and allowing the user to configure his/her own persistent preferences of sound format, language, compression level, etc. [cf., e.g. Weisbecker/Bauer 1998].\n\nThe version of Java used is Java 1.1.3, with the JFC/Swing 1.03 layer on the client side. The ORB software used is Visibroker for Java 3.2 and Visibroker for C++ 3.1. The database used is the Oracle 8.0.3.0 database accessed by JDBC 8.0.4.0.6 Level 2 drivers.\n\nThe Web server is Apache 1.2.4, and the dynamical sound conversion scripts are launched by CGI calls with Perl 5.0.3. The conversion programs are IRCAM's STtools toolkit (updated and completed by the Studio Online Team).\n\nThe server machine is a Sun Microsystems Enterprise UltraSparc 3000 running Solaris 2.5.1.\n\nThe disk array is a Sun Microsystems Raid RSM 2000, configured Raid 5, with 31 disks a 9 GB each, plus two hot spare and a cold spare disk. This gives us, after formatting, a usable disk space of 190 GB. The database disk (1 HD)is fully mirrored with RAID 0+1.\n\nThe sound total is 113.823 sounds with 6 tracks each, sampled with 48k, 24 bit (ca. 130 GB of data, which correspond ca. 12 days of continuous listening).\n\n## 7 New Features in Studio Online 3.0\n\nDuring 1997, brilliant developer Rolf Wohrmann created, in close collaboration with Guillaume Ballet, versions 1 through 2.6, gradually fixing the architecture as described above [Wohrmann 1997, 1999]. This version was a fully working, albeit somewhat restricted prototype which already served the needs of a constantly growing user group. During 1998, the sound database was completed to 16 instruments by the recording and editing team, and the software system was enhanced, completed, and tuned by the new development team. Startup of the client applet was optimized by loading all classes \"on demand\". Full support of the Windows platform was added (WAVE sound file format, support of the Explorer way to handle multimedia data, etc.), sound transformations became stereo and could be indefinitely chained. The client interface was completely redesigned, became fully resizable and uniform on all platforms (Swing/JFC look and feel), graphically much enhanced by the hierarchical directory view in the sound manager with indication of the download size, graphical break point function editors for time-dependent transformations, menus and tab controls instead of buttons, etc. Many minor improvements were done to the client, the servers, and the various administration tools. Some small but useful features were added, like e.g. the progress messages during transformation processes and the possibility to abort them, the possibility to download multiple sounds in one archive file or to automatically order sounds on CD, and automatic dithering of 8 bit sound. More information is to be found in the release notes [SOL].\n\n## 8 Some Problems Encountered\n\nWe had much trouble when upgrading from the Java 1.0 AWT to the Swing/JFC library. All Swing GUI action is done in the user thread which blocks on synchronous remote method invocations. Since we cannot predict the response time of such remote calls we had to program our own threading policy in order to refresh the user interface during a remote call. We finally decided to launch a thread for each remote connection. But then we had the difficulty of synchronizing these threads, especially in order to prevent a user nervously clicking on the interface and flooding the server with newly opened threads (we realized this problem when during testing, our JDBC drivers simply blocked the whole system without any error message after we heectically clicked some hundred times in the interface). This considerably complicated the programming of the selector interface. We would have wished the Swing/JFC layer to implement the same threading policy as the old AWT.\n\nWe also had much trouble with a bug in the Gatekeeper which blocked without any error indication after a couple of days. I shall not mention the dozens of minor bugs in the various Swing/JFC betas and other used software (especially our Java development tool). But the most annoying bugs and deficiencies were found in the browser software: no resizing of the applet in Netscape, no upload of sounds possible with the Explorer on the Mac, to name only the most flagrant ones. Microsoft did not correctly port their current Java Virtual Machine to the MAC, and the Apple MRI is so sloppily implemented that one has to invent dozens of workarounds in order to be able to use it at all. See [SOL] for details.\n\n## 9 Future Work\n\nStudio Online is actually a project designed for the future. We used the latest technology available at the time, much to the disenchantment of some of our users which were not able or ready to upgrade to the latest Web Browser versions with a Java Virtual Machines fully compliant to the Java 1.1 API. We needed the new Java version as well as Sunsoft's Swing/JFC classes for the advanced graphics in the applet's user interface. We even would have preferred to migrate to Java 1.2 if it had been available at the time, for it integrates the ca. 2 MB of JFC class code that have to be downloaded on the first use of Studio Online. When using Nescape Communicator which already integrates Visibroker's CORBA classes (albeitin an older version), the applet could even shrink again to its old size of some hundred KB (which at the time gave it the nickname \"JORBA\" for \"**just one** really **big** applet\"3). Java 1.2 would also invite to replace the current CGI driven downloading and playing of audio data by an integrated solution using (an improved form of) the Java Media Framework, with its support of many more file formats, etc.\n\nFootnote 3: Another possible sense of the JORBA acronym could be the combination of **J**ava and **CORBA** technology.\n\nDespite its success, Studio Online should be considered only the beginning of a much more ambitious project of internetworked sound processing, transparently distributed sound storage and access, and the design of component software for music purposes. It has been shown that Studio Online technology can solve some of the problems of a large and historically grown research institution as IRCAM, but there is still a long way to go.\n\nFor example, the current integration of IRCAM sound processing tools works by command line wrapping which is a tedious, limited and suboptimal way to expose them to remote use. There are 3 to 8 separate processes launched per transformation: the various sound conversion tools to feed the source sound into and to retrieve the processed sound from a command pipeline, the splitting of stereo sound into mono channels for the Additive engine which itself is but a script executing command lines. Under these conditions, it was already an achievement to implement such basic remote controls as a gauge to monitor the progress of a transformation and a button to remotely abort the transformation process!\n\nInstead of launching shells executing assembled command line strings, the sound processing engines should be encapsulated as multithreaded CORBA servers. Once there will be stable versions and well-defined control interfaces of these engines, it will be much easier to develop intuitive and fault-tolerant integrated systems using them. It would then be feasible to develop unified graphic interfaces for expert configuration of these sound processing engines which have remarkable possibilities if used in advanced mode.\n\nStudio Online should develop into a testbed for advanced tool integration, sound internetworking, and audio research with the help of distributed objects. There is no lack of ideas: projects have been conceived of treating the integration of distributed databases, advanced content search in audio documents (instead of the current table lookup), integration of more IRCAM software, etc.\n\n## 10 Conclusion\n\nStudio Online has been one of the few realizations answering the call for projects on the \"Information Highway\" that have been successfully completed in time. This fact makes it all the more deplorable that there has not been any kind of immediate follow-up project. Aside from the fact that much more functionality could have been added to and on top of Studio Online, it is with the expertise gained during this project that even more interesting inter/intranet applications of distributed processing for musical purposes could have been envisaged.\n\n## References\n\n* [Ballet 1998] Guillaume Ballet, Vincent Puig, Hugues Vinet, _Projet Studio en ligne, Rapport final_, IRCAM, Nov. 1998, unpublished.\n* [Ballet 1998] Guillaume Ballet, _Rapport d'avancement du projet Studio en ligne I, II, III_, [http://sol.ircam.fr/~ballet/rapports/](http://sol.ircam.fr/~ballet/rapports/)* and [http://sol.ircam.fr/docs/sol3.0/](http://sol.ircam.fr/docs/sol3.0/)\n* [Hoffmann 1998] Peter Hoffmann, Studio Online III: Distribution and Interaction.

The modular approach of the project allows \nmusicians and researchers to write simple scripts rapidly \nand reuse them in other projects. The toolkit aims to provide powerful software tools integrated with sophisticated \nmusical knowledge to both musicians with little programming experience (especially musicologists) and to \nprogrammers with only modest music theory skills. \nThis paper introduces the music21 system, demonstrating how to use it and the types of problems it is wellsuited toward advancing. We include numerous examples \nof its power and flexibility, including demonstrations of \ngraphing data and generating annotated musical scores. \n1. INTRODUCTION: WHY MUSIC21?\nComputers have transformed so many aspects of musicology\u2014from writing and editing papers, to studying \nmanuscripts with digital files, to creating databases of \ncomposers\u2019 letters, to typesetting editions\u2014that it is incredible that most analytical tasks that music historians \nperform remain largely untouched by technology. The \nstudy of the rich troves of musical data in scores, \nsketches, intabulations, lead-sheets, and other sources of \nsymbolic music data is still done almost exclusively by \nhand. Even when databases and spreadsheets are employed, they are usually created for a single purpose. \nSuch specialized approaches cannot easily be reused. \nComputer scientists often assume that, compared to \nworking with scanned images of scores or sound files, \nmanipulating symbolic data should be a cinch. Most of \nthe information from a score can easily be converted to \ntext-based or numeric formats that general-purpose statistical or information-retrieval tools can manipulate. In \npractice the complexities of music notation and theory \nresult in these tools rarely being sufficient. \nFor instance, a researcher might want to compare \nhow closely the music of two composers adheres to a particular scale (say, the major scale). What begins as a \nstraightforward statistical problem requiring little musical \nknowledge\u2014simply encode which notes are in the scale \nof the piece\u2019s key and which are not\u2014can quickly grow \nbeyond the capabilities of general statistics packages. \nSuppose that after some initial work, our researcher decides that notes on stronger beats should be weighed \nmore heavily than those on weaker beats. Now she must \neither add the information about beats by hand to each \nnote or write a new algorithm that labels the beats. Beat \nlabeling is another task that initially seems easy but rapidly becomes extremely troublesome for several reasons.  \nAre grace-notes accented or unaccented? Only a musically-trained ear that also knows the norms of an era can tell. \nIncompletely-filled measures, such as pickup measures \nand mid-bar repeats, present problems for algorithms. As \nthe researcher\u2019s corpus expands, the time spent on metaresearch expands with it. What began as a straightforward \nproject becomes a set of tedious separate labors: transforming data from multiple formats into one, moving \ntransposing instruments into sounding pitch, editorial accidentals in early music, or finding ways of visualizing \ntroublesome moments for debugging. \nResearchers in other fields can call upon generalpurpose toolkits to deal with time-consuming yet largely \nsolved problems. For instance, a scientist working with a \nlarge body of text has easy access to open-source libraries \nfor removing punctuation, converting among textencoding formats, correcting spelling, identifying parts of \nspeech, sentence diagramming, automatic translation, and \nof course rendering text in a variety of media. Libraries \nand programs to help with the musical equivalents of \neach of these tasks do exist, but few exchange data with \neach other in standardized formats. Even fewer are designed in modern, high-level programming languages. As \na result of these difficulties, computational solutions to \nmusicological problems are rarely employed even when \nthey would save time, expand the scope of projects, or \nquickly find important exceptions to overly broad pronouncements. \nThe music21 project (http://web.mit.edu/music21) \nexpands the audience for computational musicology by \ncreating a new toolkit built from the ground up with intuitive simplicity and object-oriented design throughout. \n(The \u201c21\u201d in the title comes from the designation for \nMIT\u2019s classes in Music, Course 21M.) The advantages of \nobject-oriented design have led to its wide adoption in \nmany realms of software engineering. These design principles have been employed in music synthesis and generation systems over the past 25 years [2, 9, 10] but have \nnot been thoroughly integrated into packages for the \nanalysis of music as symbolic data. Humdrum, the most \nwidely adopted software package [6], its contemporary \nports [7, 11], and publications using these packages show \nthe great promise of computational approaches to music \ntheory and musicology. Yet Humdrum can be difficult to \nuse: both programmers and non-programmers alike may \nfind its reliance on a chain of shell-scripts, rather than object-oriented libraries, limiting and not intuitive.  \nNicholas Cook has called upon programmers to \ncreate for musicologists \u201ca modular approach involving \n637\n11th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2010)\n\fan unlimited number of individual software tools\u201d [3]. A \nframework built with intuitive, reusable, and expandable \nobjects satisfies Cook\u2019s call without sacrificing power for \nmore complex tasks. \nAs a new, open-source, cross-platform toolkit written \nin Python, music21 provides such a modular approach, \nmelding object-oriented music representation and analysis with a concise and simple programming interface. \nSimplicity of use, ease of expansion, and access to existing data are critical to the design of music21. The toolkit \nimports Humdrum/Kern, MusicXML [4], and userdefined formats (with MIDI and MuseData forthcoming). \nBecause it is written in Python, music21 can tap into \nmany other libraries, integrating internet resources (such \nas geomapping with Google Maps), visualization software, and sophisticated database searches with musical \nanalysis. \nThis brief paper gives an overview of the music21\ntoolkit. Through examples of musicological applications \nthat the system enables, the main distinguishing features \nare illustrated: simplicity of use and expansion. \n2. SCRIPTING AND OBJECTS \nMusic21 is built in Python, a well-established programming language packaged with Macintosh and Unix computers and freely downloadable for Windows users.  The \ntoolkit adds a set of related libraries, providing sophisticated musical knowledge to Python. As shown in Figure \n1, after adding the system with \u201cfrom music21    \nimport *\u201d, straightforward tasks such as displaying or \nplaying a short melody, getting a twelve-tone matrix, or \nconverting from Humdrum\u2019s Kern format to MusicXML \ncan each be accomplished with a single line of code. \nDisplay a simple melody in musical notation:\n  tinyNotation.TinyNotationStream( \n        \"c4 d8 f g16 a g f#\", \"3/4\").show() \nPrint the twelve-tone matrix for a tone row (in this case the \nopening of Schoenberg\u2019s Fourth String Quartet): \nprint(serial.rowToMatrix( \n            [2,1,9,10,5,3,4,0,8,7,6,11]) )  \nor since most of the 2nd-Viennese school rows are already \navailable as objects, you could instead type:   \nprint(serial.RowSchoenbergOp37().matrix() ) \nConvert a file from Humdrum\u2019s **kern data format to MusicXML for editing in Finale or Sibelius: \n  parse('/users/documents/composition.krn'). \n      write('xml') \nFigure 1. Three simple examples of one-line music21 scripts. \nThough single-line tasks are simpler to accomplish in \nmusic21 than in existing packages, the full power of the \nnew toolkit comes from bringing together and extending \nhigh-level objects. The framework includes many objects, \nincluding Pitches, Chords, Durations, TimeSignatures, \nIntervals, Instruments, and standard Ornaments. Through \nmethod calls, objects can perform their own analyses and \ntransformations. For instance, Chords can find their own \nroots, create closed-position versions of themselves, \ncompute their Forte prime forms, and so on. Researchers \ncan extend objects for their own needs, such as altering \nthe pitch of open Violin strings to study scordatura, specializing (subclassing) the Note class into MensuralNote \nfor studying Renaissance Music, or grouping Measures \ninto Hypermeters. The object-oriented design of music21 simplifies writing these extensions. \n3. STREAMS: POWERFUL, NESTABLE, \nCONTAINERS OF TIMED ELEMENTS \nAt the core of music21 is a novel grouping of musical \ninformation into Streams: nestable containers that allow \nresearchers to quickly find simultaneous events, follow a \nvoice, or represent instruments playing in different tempi \nand meters. Elements within Streams are accessed with \nmethods such as getElementById(), an approach similarly to the Document Object Model (DOM) of retrieving \nelements from within XML and HTML documents. Like \nnearly every music21 object, Streams can immediately \nbe visually displayed in Lilypond or with programs that \nimport MusicXML (such as Finale and Sibelius).  \nThrough the Stream model, a program can find notes or \nchords satisfying criteria that change from section to section of a piece, such as all notes that are the seventhdegree of the current key (as identified either manually or \nwith an included key-detection algorithm) and then retrieve information such as the last-defined clef, dynamic, \nor metrical accent level at that point. \n Many tools to visualize, process, and annotate \nStreams come with the music21 framework. These tools \ninclude graphing modules, analytical tools, and convenience routines for metrical analysis [8], phrase extraction, \nand identification of non-harmonic tones. Figure 2 demonstrates the use of metrical analysis, derived from \nnested hierarchical subdivisions of the time signature [1], \nto annotate two Bach chorales in different meters. \nfrom music21.analysis import metrical \n# load a Bach Chorale from the music21 corpus of supplied pieces \nbwv30_6 = corpus.parseWork('bach/bwv30.6.xml') \n# get just the bass part using DOM-like method calls\nbass = bwv30_6.getElementById('Bass') \n# get measures 1 through 10\nexcerpt = bass.getMeasureRange(1,10) \n# apply a Lerdahl/Jackendoff-style metrical analysis to the piece.\nmetrical.labelBeatDepth(excerpt) \n# display measure 0 (pickup) to measure 6 in the default viewer  \n# (here Finale Reader 2009)\nexcerpt.show() \n638\n11th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2010)\n\f#\nb\na\ne\nm\ne\nF\nla\nS\ntw\nw\nm\nta\np\na\nlo\na\nw\n# perform the same\nbwv11_6 = cor\nalto = bwv11_\nexcerpt = alt\nmetrical.labe\nexcerpt.show(\nFigure 2.

Among his other writings, the \nearly-fifteenth century music theorist Nicolaus of Capua \ngave a set of regulae, or rules, for creating musica ficta\n[5]. Musica ficta, simply put, was a way of avoiding tritones and other undesirable intervals and create more \nconclusive cadences through the use of unwritten accidentals that performers would know to sing. Unlike the \nrules of most other theorists of his time, Nicolaus\u2019s four \nrules rely solely on the melodic intervals of one voice. \nHerlinger\u2019s study of Nicolaus\u2019s rules suggested that they \ncould be extremely successful at eliminating harmonic \nproblems while at the same time being easy enough for \nany musician to master. However, as is conventional in \nmusicology, this study was performed by hand on a few \nexcerpts of music by a single composer, Antonio Zachara \nda Teramo. Using music21 we have been able to automatically apply Nicolaus\u2019s rules to a much wider set of \nencoded music, the complete incipits and cadences of all \nTrecento ballate (about 10,000 measures worth of music) \nand then automatically evaluate the quality of harmonic \nchanges implied by these rules. Figure 7 shows an excerpt of the code for a single rule, that a descending major second (\u201cM-2\u201d) immediately followed by an ascending major second (\u201cM2\u201d) should be transformed into two \nhalf-steps by raising the middle note: \n# n1, n2, and n3 are three consecutive notes \n# i1 is the interval between n1 and n2\n# i2 is the interval between n2 and n3\ni1 = generateInterval(n1,n2) \ni2 = generateInterval(n2,n3) \n# we test if the two intervals are the ones fitting the rule\nif i1.directedName == \"M-2\" and \\ \n   i2.directedName == \"M2\":\n  # since the intervals match , we add an editorial accidental\n  n2.editorial.ficta = \\  \n         Accidental(\"sharp\")\n641\n11th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2010)\n\f# we also color the affected notes so that if we display the music \n  # the notes stick out.

The modular approach of the project allows musicians and researchers to write simple scripts rapidly and reuse them in other projects. The toolkit aims to provide powerful software tools integrated with sophisticated musical knowledge to both musicians with little programming experience (especially musicologists) and to programmers with only modest music theory skills.\n\nThis paper introduces the music21 system, demonstrating how to use it and the types of problems it is well-suited toward advancing. We include numerous examples of its power and flexibility, including demonstrations of graphing data and generating annotated musical scores.\n\nMusic21 Music21 Music21 Music21 Music21 Music21 Music21 Music21 Music21 Music21 Music21 Music21 Music21 Music21 Music21\n\n## 1 Introduction: Why Music21?\n\nComputers have transformed so many aspects of musicology--from writing and editing papers, to studying manuscripts with digital files, to creating databases of composers' letters, to typesetting editions--that it is incredible that most analytical tasks that music historians perform remain largely untouched by technology. The study of the rich troves of musical data in scores, sketches, intabulations, lead-sheets, and other sources of symbolic music data is still done almost exclusively by hand. Even when databases and spreadsheets are employed, they are usually created for a single purpose. Such specialized approaches cannot easily be reused.\n\nComputer scientists often assume that, compared to working with scanned images of scores or sound files, manipulating symbolic data should be a cinch. Most of the information from a score can easily be converted to text-based or numeric formats that general-purpose statistical or information-retrieval tools can manipulate. In practice the complexities of music notation and theory result in these tools rarely being sufficient.\n\nFor instance, a researcher might want to compare how closely the music of two composers adheres to a particular scale (say, the major scale). What begins as a straightforward statistical problem requiring little musical knowledge--simply encode which notes are in the scale of the piece's key and which are not--can quickly grow beyond the capabilities of general statistics packages. Suppose that after some initial work, our researcher decides that notes on stronger beats should be weighed more heavily than those on weaker beats. Now the must either add the information about beats by hand to each note or write a new algorithm that labels the beats. Beat labeling is another task that initially seems easy but rapidly becomes extremely troublesome for several reasons. Are grace-notes accented or unaccented? Only a musical-ly-trained ear that also knows the norms of an era can tell. Incompletely-filled measures, such as pickup measures and mid-bar repeats, present problems for algorithms. As the researcher's corpus expands, the time spent on measurement expands with it. What began as a straightforward project becomes a set of tedious separate labors: transforming data from multiple formats into one, moving transposing instruments into sounding pitch, editorial accidentals in early music, or finding ways of visualizing troublesome moments for debugging.\n\nResearchers in other fields can call upon general-purpose toolkits to deal with time-consuming yet largely solved problems. For instance, a scientist working with a large body of text has easy access to open-source libraries for removing punctuation, converting among text-encoding formats, correcting spelling, identifying parts of speech, sentence diagramming, automatic translation, and of course rendering text in a variety of media. Libraries and programs to help with the musical equivalents of each of these tasks do exist, but few exchange data with each other in standardized formats. Even fewer are designed in modern, high-level programming languages. As a result of these difficulties, computational solutions to musicological problems are rarely employed even when they would save time, expand the scope of projects, or quickly find important exceptions to overly broad pronouncements.\n\nThe music21 project ([http://web.mit.edu/music21](http://web.mit.edu/music21)) expands the audience for computational musicology by creating a new toolkit built from the ground up with intuitive simplicity and object-oriented design throughout. (The \"21\" in the title comes from the designation for MIT's classes in Music, Course 21M, The advantages of object-oriented design have led to its wide adoption in many realms of software engineering. These design principles have been employed in music synthesis and generation systems over the past 25 years [2, 9, 10] but have not been thoroughly integrated into packages for the analysis of music as symbolic data. Hundrum, the most widely adopted software package [6], its contemporary ports [7, 11], and publications using these packages show the great promise of computational approaches to music theory and musicology. Yet Hundrum can be difficult to use: both programmers and non-programmers alike may find its reliance on a chain of shell-scripts, rather than object-oriented libraries, limiting and not intuitive.\n\nNicholas Cook has called upon programmers to create for musicologists \"a modular approach involving\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:2]\n\n## 4 Further Features\n\nIn addition to providing sophisticated resources in a modern programming language, the music21 package takes advantage of some of the best contemporary approaches to software distribution, licensing, development, and documentation. These approaches assure both the longevity of the system across multiple platforms as well as the ability of the system to grow and incorporate the work of contributors.\n\n### An Integrated and Virtual Corpus of Music for Researchers\n\nMusic21 comes with a corpus package, a large collection of freely-distributable music for analysis and testing, including a complete collection of the Bach Chorales, numerous Bechwine String Quartets, and examples of Renaissance polyphony. The virtual corpus extends the corpus package even further. Similar to a collection of URL bookmarks to music resources, additional repertoires, available online, can be automatically downloaded when first requested and then made available to the researcher for future use. The corpus includes both Kern and MusicXML files. Future system expansions will not only grow the tools for analysis, but also the breadth and depth of the corpus of works.\n\n### Permissive License and Full Documentation\n\nMusic21 is a toolkit: a collection of tools that work together in a wide range of contexts. The promise of a toolkit is only achieved if users can expand and integrate software components in their own work. Thus, music21 is released under the Lesser General Public License (LGPL), allowing its use within both free and commercial software. So that implementation and documentation stay synchronized, the toolkit also features high-quality, indexed, and searchable documentation of all modules and classes, automatically created from the source code and test routines. The music21 site ([http://web.mit.edu/music21](http://web.mit.edu/music21)) hosts up-to-date information, documentation and release links. Code browsing, feature requests, and bug reports are housed at Google Code.\n\n## 5 Examples\n\nBetter than an explanation of high-level features, a few specific examples illustrate the toolkit's promise. These examples are chosen for both their novel and practical utility.\n\n### Finding Chords within Melodic Fragments\n\nThe script in Figure 3 searches the entire second violin part of a MusicXML score of Bechowen's _Grofe Fuge_, op. 133, to find measures that medically express dominant seventh chords in consecutive notes. It then displays the chord in closed position, the surrounding measure, and the Forte prime form. (Running the same query across barlines would add just a few lines of code).\n\nop133 = corpus.parseMork{'beethoven/opus133.xml'} violin2 = op133.getElementById('2nd Violin')\n\n_# an empty container for later display_ display = stream.Stream()\n\n**for** thisMeasure**in** violin2.measures:\n\n_# got a list of consecutive notes, skipping unions, octaves, #and runs (and run putting nothing in their places)_ notes = thisMeasure.ritolConnecutiveNotes( skipUnions=True, skipOtaves=True, skipBests=True, noNone=True)\n\npitches = stream.Stream(notes).pitches\n\nFigure 2: Analytical tools, such as this metrical accent labeler, are included with music21 and work with most Streams (including Scores and Parts). Here, excerpts of two Bach chorales, each in a different meter, are labeled with dots corresponding to their metric strengths.\n\n### Distributions of Notes by Pitch and Duration\n\nFigure 4 demonstrates the ability of music21 graphs to help visualize trends that are otherwise difficult to discern. These graphs plot three features: pitch, duration of notes, and how frequently these pitches and durations are used. From two small excepts of pieces in 3/4 by Mozart (a minur, in red) and by Chopin (a maxurka, in blue), it can be seen that pitches in the Mozart example follow a type of bell-curve distribution, with few high notes, few low notes, and many notes toward the middle of the registral space. Chopin's usage jumps throughout the piano. The differences in pitch usage suggest that this line of inquiry is worth pursuing further, but no connection between duration and pitch appears. Music21's easy-to-use graphing methods help researchers find the best visualization tool for their data, easily switching among diverse formats.\n\n```\nfrommusic21.musicom1importtestFilesasxml frommusic21.humdrumimporttestFilesaskern\n```\n#display3Dgraphsofcount,pitch,andduration mozartStream=music21.parse() xml.mozartFlor658Iklecar.notes=mozartStream.flat.stripTries() q=graph.Plot3DBarsaPitchSpaceQuarterLength(notes,colors=['r']) q.process() ```\n\nThe Mozart and Chopin examples, while showing distinctive individual usage, show little correlation between pitch and duration. Many other pieces do. An extreme example is Messian's \"Mode de valeurs et d'intensities\" from _Quatre eudes de rythme_, perhaps the first work of total serialism. A perfect correlation between pitch and duration, as found in the middle voice (isolated for clarity), is plotted in Figure 5. An aspect of\n\nFigure 4: Differences in pitch distribution between Mozart and Chopin.\n\nFigure 3: The results of a search for chords expressed melodically.\n\nthe composition that is difficult to observe in the score but easy to see in this graph is the cubic shape (:-x) made through the choice of pitches and rhythms. This shape is not at all explained by the serial method of the piece. Also easily seen is that, although Messiainen uses lower notes less often, there is not a perfect correlation between pitch and frequency of use (e.g., 21 B-flats vs. 22 A-flats).\n\n### Pitch Class Density Over Time\n\nIn Figure 6, pitch class usage, over the duration of the composition in the cello part of a MusicXML score of Beethoven's _Grose Fuge_, is graphed.

Ferreira\nUniversity of California, Santa Cruz\nDepartment of Computational Media\nJim Whitehead\nUniversity of California, Santa Cruz\nDepartment of Computational Media\nABSTRACT\nDeep Learning models have shown very promising results in automatically composing polyphonic music pieces.\nHowever, it is very hard to control such models in order to\nguide the compositions towards a desired goal. We are interested in controlling a model to automatically generate\nmusic with a given sentiment. This paper presents a generative Deep Learning model that can be directed to compose music with a given sentiment. Besides music generation, the same model can be used for sentiment analysis\nof symbolic music. We evaluate the accuracy of the model\nin classifying sentiment of symbolic music using a new\ndataset of video game soundtracks. Results show that our\nmodel is able to obtain good prediction accuracy. A user\nstudy shows that human subjects agreed that the generated\nmusic has the intended sentiment, however negative pieces\ncan be ambiguous.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nMusic Generation is an important application domain of\nDeep Learning in which models learn musical features\nfrom a dataset in order to generate new, interesting music.\nSuch models have been capable of generating high quality\npieces of different styles with strong short-term dependencies 1 [2]. A major challenge of this domain consists of\ndisentangling these models to generate compositions with\ngiven characteristics. For example, one can\u2019t easily control a model trained on classical piano pieces to compose\na tense piece for a horror scene of a movie. Being able\nto control the output of the models is specially important\nfor the field of Affective Music Composition, whose major\ngoal is to automatically generate music that is perceived\nto have a specific emotion or to evoke emotions in listeners [19]. Applications involve generating soundtracks for\nmovies and video-games [18], sonification of biophysical\ndata [3] and generating responsive music for the purposes\nof music therapy and palliative care [9].\nRecently, Radford et al. [13] showed that a generative Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network can\n1 Supporting strong long-term dependencies (music form) is still an\nopen problem.\n\u00a9 Lucas N.

When\ncombined to a Logistic Regression, this LSTM achieves\nstate-of-the-art sentiment analysis accuracy on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset and can match the performance of previous supervised systems using 30-100x\nfewer labeled examples.\nThis LSTM stores almost all\nof the sentiment signal in a distinct \u201csentiment neuron\u201d,\nwhich can be used to control the LSTM to generate sentences with a given sentiment. In this paper, we explore\nthis approach with the goal of composing symbolic music\nwith a given sentiment. We also explore this approach as a\nsentiment classifier for symbolic music.\nIn order to evaluate this approach, we need a dataset of\nmusic in symbolic format that is annotated by sentiment.\nEven though emotion detection is an important topic in\nmusic information retrieval [7], it is typically studied on\nmusic in audio format. To the best of our knowledge, there\nare no datasets of symbolic music annotated according to\nsentiment. Therefore, we created a new dataset composed\nof 95 MIDI labelled piano pieces (966 phrases of 4 bars)\nfrom video game soundtracks. Each piece is annotated by\n30 human subjects according to a valence-arousal (dimensional) model of emotion [15]. The sentiment of each piece\nis then extracted by summarizing the 30 annotations and\nmapping the valence axis to sentiment. The same dataset\nalso contains another 728 non-labelled pieces, which were\nused for training the generative LSTM.\nWe combine this generative LSTM with a Logistic\nRegression and analyse its sentiment prediction accuracy\nagainst a traditional classification LSTM trained in a fullysupervised way. Results showed that our model (generative LSTM with Logistic Regression) outperformed the supervised LSTM by approximately 30%. We also analysed\nthe generative capabilities of our model with a user study.\nHuman subjects used an online annotation tool to label 3\npieces controlled to be negative and 3 pieces controlled to\nbe positive. Results showed human annotators agree the\ngenerated positive pieces have the intended sentiment. The\ngenerated negative pieces appear to be ambiguous, having\nboth negative and positive parts.\nWe believe this paper is the first work to explore sentiment analysis in symbolic music and it presents the first\ndisentangled Deep Learning model for music generation\nwith sentiment. Another contribution of this paper is a labelled dataset of symbolic music annotated according to\nsentiment. These contributions open several direction for\narXiv:2103.06125v1  [cs.LG]  9 Mar 2021\n\ffuture research, specially music generation with emotions\nas both a multi-class problem and as a regression problem. Moreover, these methods could be applied to create\nsoundtrack generation systems for films, video games, interactive narratives, audio books, etc.\n2. RELATED WORK\nThis paper is related to previous work on Affective Algorithmic Music Composition, more specifically to works\nthat process music in symbolic form in order to generate\nmusic with a given emotion. A common approach for this\nproblem consists of designing a rule-based system to map\nmusical features to a given emotion in a categorical or dimensional space [19]. For example, Williams et al. [18]\npropose a system to generate soundtracks for video games\nwhere each game\u2019s scene graph (defining all the possible branching of scenes in the game) is annotated according to a valence-arousal model. A second-order Markov\nmodel is used to learn melodies from a dataset and are\nthen transformed by a rule-based system to fit the annotated emotions in the graph. Davis and Mohammad [4]\nfollow a similar approach in TransPose, a system that composes piano melodies for novels. TransPose uses a lexiconbased approach to automatically detect emotions (categorical model) in novels and a rule-based technique to create\npiano melodies with these emotions.\nThere are a few other approaches in the literature to\ncompose music with a given emotion. Scirea et al. [16]\nrecently presented a framework called MetaCompose designed to create background music for games in real-time.\nMetaCompose generates music by (i) randomly creating\na chord sequence from a pre-defined chord progression\ngraph, (ii) evolving a melody for this chord sequence using a genetic algorithm and (iii) producing an accompaniment for the melody/chord sequence combination. Monteith et al. [10] approaches Affective Algorithmic Music\nComposition from a Machine Learning perspective to learn\nmelodies and rhythms from a corpus of music labeled according to a categorical model of emotion. Individual Hidden Markov models and n-grams are trained for each category to generate pitches and underlying harmonies, respectively. Rhythms are sampled randomly from examples of a\ngiven category.\nDeep Learning models have recently achieved highquality results in music composition with short-term dependencies [2]. These models normally are trained on a\ncorpus of MIDI files to predict the next note to be played\nbased on a given note. In general, these models can\u2019t be\nmanipulated to generate music with a given emotion. For\nexample, in the system DeepBach, Hadjeres et al. [5] use a\ndependency network and a Gibbs-like sampling procedure\nto generate high-quality four-part chorales in the style of\nBach. Roberts et at. [14] train recurrent variational autoencoder (VAEs) to reproduce short musical sequences and\nwith a novel hierarchical decoder they are able to model\nlong sequences with musical structure for both individual\ninstruments and a three-piece band (lead, bass, and drums).\nThe majority of the deep learning models are trained\nto generate musical scores and not performances. Oore et\nal. [11] tackles this problem by training an LSTM with a\nnew representation that supports tempo and velocity events\nfrom MIDI files. This model was trained on the Yamaha\ne-Piano Competition [1], which contains MIDI captures\nof ~1400 performances by skilled pianists.\nWith this\nnew representation and dataset, Oore et al. [11] generated\nmore human-like performances when compared to previous models.\n3. MODEL\nWe propose a Deep Learning method for affective algorithmic composition that can be controlled to generate music\nwith a given sentiment. This method is based on the work\nof Radford et al. [13] which generates product reviews (in\ntextual form) with sentiment. Radford et al. [13] used a\nsingle-layer multiplicative long short-term memory (mLSTM) network [8] with 4096 units to process text as a sequence of UTF-8 encoded bytes (character-based language\nmodeling). For each byte, the model updates its hidden\nstate of the mLSTM and predicts a probability distribution\nover the next possible byte.\nThis mLSTM was trained on the Amazon product review dataset, which contains over 82 million product reviews from May 1996 to July 2014 amounting to over 38\nbillion training bytes [6].\nRadford et al. [13] used the\ntrained mLSTM to encode sentences from four different\nSentiment Analysis datasets. The encoding is performed\nby initializing the the states to zeros and processing the sequence character-by-character. The final hidden states of\nthe mLSTM are used as a feature representation. With the\nencoded datasets, Radford et al. [13] trained a simple logistic regression classifier with L1 regularization and outperformed the state-of-the-art methods at the time using\n30-100x fewer labeled examples.\nBy inspecting the relative contributions of features on\nvarious datasets, Radford et al. [13] discovered a single\nunit within the mLSTM that directly corresponded to sentiment. Because the mLSTM was trained as a generative\nmodel, one can simply set the value of the sentiment unit\nto be positive or negative and the model generates corresponding positive or negative reviews.\n3.1 Data Representation\nWe use the same combination of mLSTM and logistic regression to compose music with sentiment. To do this, we\ntreat the music composition problem as a language modeling problem. Instead of characters, we represent a music\npiece as a sequence of words and punctuation marks from a\nvocabulary that represents events retrieved from the MIDI\nfile. Sentiment is perceived in music due to several features\nsuch as melody, harmony, tempo, timbre, etc [7]. Our data\nrepresentation attempts to encode a large part of these features 2 using a small set of words:\n\u2022 \u201cn_[pitch]\u201d: play note with given pitch number: any\ninteger from 0 to 127.\n2 Constrained by the features one can extract from MIDI data.\n\ft_120 v_76 d_whole_0 n_50 n_54 n_57\nv_92 d_eighth n_86 . . v_84\nd_quarter_1 n_81 . .\nFigure 1: A short example piece encoded using our proposed representation. The encoding represents the first two\ntime steps of the shown measure.\n\u2022 \u201cd_[duration]_[dots]\u201d: change the duration of the\nfollowing notes to a given duration type with a given\namount of dots. Types are breve, whole, half, quarter, eighth, 16th and 32nd. Dots can be any integer\nfrom 0 to 3.\n\u2022 \u201cv_[velocity]\u201d: change the velocity of the following\nnotes to a given velocity (loudness) number. Velocity is discretized in bins of size 4, so it can be any\ninteger in the set V = 4, 8, 12, . . . , 128.\n\u2022 \u201ct_[tempo]\u201d: change the tempo of the piece to a\ngiven tempo in bpm. Tempo is also discretized in\nbins of size 4, so it can be any integer in the set\nT = 24, 28, 32, . . . , 160.\n\u2022 \u201c.\u201d: end of time step. Each time step is one sixteenth\nnote long.\n\u2022 \u201c\\n\u201d: end of piece.\nFor example, Figure 1 shows the encoding of the first\ntwo time steps of the first measure of the Legend of Zelda\n- Ocarina of Time\u2019s Prelude of Light. The first time step\nsets the tempo to 120bpm, the velocity of the following\nnotes to 76 and plays the D Major Triad for the duration\nof a whole note. The second time step sets the velocity\nto 84 and plays a dotted quarter A5 note. The total size\nof this vocabulary is 225 and it represents both the composition and performance elements of a piece (timing and\ndynamics).\n4. SENTIMENT DATASET\nIn order to apply the Radford et al. [13] method to compose music with sentiment, we also need a dataset of MIDI\nfiles to train the LSTM and another one to train the logistic regression. There are many good datasets of music\nin MIDI format in the literature. However, to the best of\nour knowledge, none are labelled according to sentiment.\nThus, we created a new dataset called VGMIDI which is\ncomposed of 823 pieces extracted from video game soundtracks in MIDI format. We choose video game soundtracks\nbecause they are normally composed to keep the player\nin a certain affective state and thus they are less subjective pieces. All the pieces are piano arrangements of the\nsoundtracks and they vary in length from 26 seconds to\n3 minutes. Among these pieces, 95 are annotated according to a 2-dimensional model that represents emotion using\na valence-arousal pair. Valence indicates positive versus\nnegative emotion, and arousal indicates emotional intensity [17].\nWe use this valence-arousal model because it allows continuous annotation of music and because of its\nflexibility\u2014one can directly map a valence-arousal (v-a)\npair to a multiclass (happy, sad, surprise, etc) or a binary\n(positive/negative) model. Thus, the same set of labelled\ndata permits the investigation of affective algorithmic music composition as both a classification (multiclass and/or\nbinary) and as a regression problem. The valence-arousal\nmodel is also one of the most common dimensional models\nused to label emotion in music [17].\nAnnotating a piece according to the v-a model consists\nof continuously listening to the piece and deciding what\nvalence-arousal pair best represents the emotion of that\npiece in each moment, producing a time-series of v-a pairs.\nThis task is subjective, hence there is no single \u201ccorrect\u201d\ntime-series for a given piece. Thus, we decided to label\nthe pieces by asking several human subjects to listen to the\npieces and then considering the average time-series as the\nground truth. This process was conducted online via Amazon Mechanical Turk, where each piece was annotated by\n30 subjects using a web-based tool we designed specifically for this task. Each subject annotated 2 pieces out of\n95, and got rewarded USD $0.50 for performing this task.\n4.1 Annotation Tool and Data Collection\nThe tool we designed to annotate the video game soundtracks in MIDI format is composed of five steps, each one\nbeing a single web-page. These steps are based on the\nmethodology proposed by Soleymani et al. [17] for annotating music pieces in audio waveform. First, participants\nare introduced to the annotation task with a short description explaining the goal of the task and how long it should\ntake in average. Second, they are presented to the definitions of valence and arousal.\nIn the same page, they\nare asked to play two short pieces and indicate whether\narousal and valence are increasing or decreasing. Moreover, we ask the annotators to write two to three sentences\ndescribing the short pieces they listened to. This page is\nintended to measure their understanding of the valencearousal model and willingness to perform the task. Third,\na video tutorial was made available to the annotators explaining how to use the annotation tool. Fourth, annotators\nare exposed to the main annotation page.\nThis main page has two phases: calibration and annotation. In the calibration phase, annotators listen to the first\n15 seconds of the piece in order to get used to it and to define the starting point of the annotation circle. In the anno-\n\fFigure 2: Screenshot of the annotation tool.\ntation phase they listen to the piece from beginning to end\nand label it using the annotation circle, which starts at the\npoint defined during the calibration phase. Figure 2 shows\nthe annotation interface for valence and arousal, where annotators click and hold the circle (with the play icon) inside\nthe v-a model (outer circle) indicating the current emotion\nof the piece. In order to maximize annotators\u2019 engagement\nin the task, the piece is only played while they maintain a\nclick on the play circle. In addition, basic instructions on\nhow to use the tool are showed to the participants along\nwith the definitions of valence and arousal. A progression\nbar is also showed to the annotators so they know how far\nthey are from completing each phase. This last step (calibration and annotation) is repeated for a second piece. All\nof the pieces the annotators listened to are MIDI files synthesized with the \u201cYamaha C5 Grand\" soundfont. Finally,\nafter the main annotation step, participants provide demographic information including gender, age, location (country), musicianship experience and whether they previously\nknew the pieces they annotated.\n4.2 Data Analysis\nThe annotation task was performed by 1425 annotators,\nwhere 55% are female and 42% are male. The other 3%\nclassified themselves as transgender female, transgender\nmale, genderqueer or choose not to disclose their gender.\nAll annotators are from the United States and have an average age of approximately 31 years. Musicianship experience was assessed using a 5-point Likert scale where 1\nmeans \u201cI\u2019ve never studied music theory or practice\u201d and\n5 means \u201cI have an undergraduate degree in music\u201d. The\naverage musicianship experience is 2.28. They spent on\naverage 12 minutes and 6 seconds to annotate the 2 pieces.\nThe data collection process provides a time series of\nvalence-arousal values for each piece, however to create a\nmusic sentiment dataset we only need the valence dimension, which encodes negative and positive sentiment. Thus,\nwe consider that each piece has 30 time-series of valence\nvalues. The annotation of each piece was preprocessed,\nsummarized into one time-series and split into \u201cphrases\u201d of\nsame sentiment. The preprocessing is intended to remove\nnoise caused by subjects performing the task randomly to\nget the reward as fast as possible. The data was preprocessed by smoothing each annotation with moving average\nFigure 3: Data analysis process used to define the final\nlabel of the phrases of a piece.\nand clustering all 30 time-series into 3 clusters (positive,\nnegative and noise) according to the dynamic time-warping\ndistance metric.\nWe consider the cluster with the highest variance to be\nnoise cluster and so we discard it. The cluster with more\ntime series among the two remaining ones is then selected\nand summarized by the mean of its time series. We split\nthis mean into several segments with the same sentiment.\nThis is performed by splitting the mean at all the points\nwhere the valence changes from positive to negative or\nvice-versa. Thus, all chunks with negative valence are considered phrases with negative sentiment and the ones with\npositive valence are positive phrases. Figure 3 shows an\nexample of this three-steps process performed on a piece.\nAll the phrases that had no notes (i.e. silence phrases) were\nremoved. This process created a total of 966 phrases: 599\npositive and 367 negative.\n5. SENTIMENT ANALYSIS EVALUATION\nTo evaluate the sentiment classification accuracy of our\nmethod (generative mLSTM + logistic regression), we\ncompare it to a baseline method which is a traditional\nclassification mLSTM trained in a supervised way. Our\nmethod uses unlabelled MIDI pieces to train a generative\nmLSTM to predict the next word in a sequence. An additional logistic regression uses the hidden states of the\ngenerative mLSTM to encode the labelled MIDI phrases\nand then predict sentiment. The baseline method uses only\nlabelled MIDI phrases to train a classification mLSTM to\npredict the sentiment for the phrase.\nThe unlabelled pieces used to train the generative mLSTM were transformed in order to create additional training examples, following the methodology of Oore et al.\n[11]. The transformations consist of time-stretching (making each piece up to 5% faster or slower) and transposition\n(raising or lowering the pitch of each piece by up to a major third). We then encoded all these pieces and transformations according to our word-based representation (see\nSection 3.1). Finally, the encoded pieces were shuffled and\n\f90% of them were used for training and 10% for testing.\nThe training set was divided into 3 shards of similar size\n(approximately 18500 pieces each \u2013 325MB) and the testing set was combined into 1 shard (approximately 5800\npieces \u2013 95MB).\nWe trained the generative mLSTM with 6 different sizes\n(number of neurons in the mLSTM layer): 128, 256, 512,\n1024, 2048 and 4096. For each size, the generative mLSTM was trained for 4 epochs using the 3 training shards.\nWeights were updated with the Adam optimizer after processing sequences of 256 words on mini-batches of size\n32. The mLSTM hidden and cell states were initialized\nto zero at the beginning of each shard. They were also\npersisted across updates to simulate full-backpropagation\nand allow for the forward propagation of information outside of a given sequence [13]. Each sequence is processed\nby an embedding layer (which is trained together with the\nmLSTM layer) with 64 neurons before passing through the\nmLSTM layer. The learning rate was set to 5 \u2217 10\u22126 at the\nbeginning and decayed linearly (after each epoch) to zero\nover the course of training.\nWe evaluated each variation of the generative mLSTM\nwith a forward pass on test shard using mini-batches of size\n32. Table 1 shows the average 3 cross entropy loss for each\nvariation of the generative mLSTM.\nmLSTM Neurons\nAverage Cross Entropy Loss\n128\n1.80\n256\n1.61\n512\n1.41\n1024\n1.25\n2048\n1.15\n4096\n1.11\nTable 1: Average cross entropy loss of the generative mLSTM with different amount of neurons.\nThe average cross entropy loss decreases as the size of\nthe mLSTM increases, reaching the best result (loss 1.11)\nwhen size is equal to 4096. Thus, we used the variation\nwith 4096 neurons to proceed with the sentiment classification experiments.\nFollowing the methodology of Radford et al. [13], we\nre-encoded each of the 966 labelled phrases using the final\ncell states (a 4096 dimension vector) of the trained generative mLSTM-4096. The states are calculated by initializing\nthem to zero and processing the phrase word-by-word. We\nplug a logistic regression into the mLSTM-4096 to turn it\ninto a sentiment classifier. This logistic regression model\nwas trained with regularization \u201cL1\u201d to shrink the least important of the 4096 feature weights to zero. This ends up\nhighlighting the generative mLSTM neurons that contain\nmost of the sentiment signal.\nWe compared this generative mLSTM + logistic regression approach against our baseline, the supervised mLSTM. This is an mLSTM with exactly the same architecture and size of the generative version, but trained in a\n3 Each mini-batch reports one loss.\nfully supervised way. To train this supervised mLSTM,\nwe used the word-based representation of the phrases, but\nwe padded each phrase with silence (the symbol \u201c.\u201d) in\norder to equalize their length. Training parameters (learning rate and decay, epochs, batch size, etc) were the same\nones of the the generative mLSTM. It is important to notice\nthat in this case the mini-batches are formed of 32 labelled\nphrases and not words. We evaluate both methods using a\n10-fold cross validation approach, where the test folds have\nno phrases that appear in the training folds. Table 2 shows\nthe sentiment classification accuracy of both approaches.\nMethod\nTest Accuracy\nGen. mLSTM-4096 + Log. Reg.\n89.83 \u00b1 3.14\nSup. mLSTM-4096\n60.35 \u00b1 3.52\nTable 2: Average (10-fold cross validation) sentiment classification accuracy of both generative (with logistic regression) and supervised mLSTMs.\nThe\ngenerative\nmLSTM\nwith\nlogistic\nregression\nachieved an accuracy of 89.83%, outperforming the supervised mLSTM by 29.48%. The supervised mLSTM accuracy of 60.35% suggests that the amount of labelled data\n(966 phrases) was not enough to learn a good mapping between phrases and sentiment. The accuracy of our method\nshows that the generative mLSTM is capable of learning,\nin an unsupervised way, a good representation of sentiment\nin symbolic music.\nThis is an important result, for two reasons. First, since\nthe higher accuracy of generative mLSTM is derived from\nusing unlabeled data, it will be easier to improve this over\ntime using additional (less expensive) unlabeled data, instead of the supervised mLSTM approach which requires\nadditional (expensive) labeled data. Second, because the\ngenerative mLSTM was trained to predict the next word\nin a sequence, it can be used as a music generator. Since\nit is combined with a sentiment predictor, it opens up the\npossibility of generating music consistent with a desired\nsentiment. We explore this idea in the following section.\n6. GENERATIVE EVALUATION\nTo control the sentiment of the music generated by our mLSTM, we find the subset of neurons that contain the sentiment signal by exploring the weights of the trained logistic\nregression model. Since each of the 10 generative models\nderived from the 10 fold splits in Table 2 are themselves\na full model, we use the model with the highest accuracy.\nAs shown in Figure 4, the logistic regression trained with\nregularization \u201cL1\u201d uses 161 neurons out of 4096. Unlike\nthe results of Radford et al. [13], we don\u2019t have one single\nneuron that stores most of the sentiment signal. Instead, we\nhave many neurons contributing in a more balanced way.\nTherefore, we can\u2019t simply change the values of one neuron to control the sentiment of the output music.\nWe used a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize the\nweights of the 161 L1 neurons in order to lead our mL-\n\fFigure 4: Weights of 161 L1 neurons.\nNote multiple\nprominent positive and negative neurons.\nSTM to generate only positive or negative pieces. Each\nindividual in the population of this GA has 161 real-valued\ngenes representing a small noise to be added to the weights\nof the 161 L1 neurons.\nThe fitness of an individual is\ncomputed by (i) adding the genes of the individual to the\nweights (vector addition) of the 161 L1 neurons of the generative mLSTM, (ii) generating P pieces with this mLSTM, (iii) using the logistic regression model to predict\nthese P generated pieces and (iv) calculating the mean\nsquared error of the P predictions given a desired sentiment s \u2208 S = {0, 1}.\nThe GA starts with a random population of size 100\nwhere each gene of each individual is an uniformly sampled random number \u22122 \u2264 r \u2264 2. For each generation,\nthe GA (i) evaluates the current population, (ii) selects 100\nparents via a roulette wheel with elitism, (iii) recombines\nthe parents (crossover) taking the average of their genes\nand (iv) mutates each new recombined individual (new\noffspring) by randomly setting each gene to an uniformly\nsampled random number \u22122 \u2264 r \u2264 2.\nWe performed two independent executions of this GA,\none to optimize the mLSTM for generating positive pieces\nand another one for negative pieces. Each execution optimized the individuals during 100 epochs with crossover\nrate of 95% and mutation rate of 10%. To calculate the\nfitness of each individual, we generated P=30 pieces with\n256 words each, starting with the symbol \u201c.\u201d (end of time\nstep). The optimization for positive and negative generation resulted in best individuals with fitness 0.16 and 0.33,\nrespectively. This means that if we add the genes of the\nbest individual of the final population to the weights of the\ngenerative mLSTM, we generate positive pieces with 84%\naccuracy and negative pieces with 67% accuracy.\nAfter these two optimization processes, the genes of\nthe best final individual of the positive optimization were\nadded to the weights of the 161 L1 neurons of the trained\ngenerative mLSTM. We then generated 30 pieces with\n1000 words starting with the symbol \u201c.\u201d (end of time step)\nand randomly selected 3 of them. The same process was\nrepeated using the genes of the best final individual of the\nnegative execution. We asked annotators to label this 6\ngenerated pieces via Amazon MTurk, using the the same\nmethodology described in Section 4.1.\nFigure 5 shows\nthe average valence per measure of each of the generated\npieces.\nFigure 5: Average valence of the 6 generated pieces, as\ndetermined by human annotators. with least variance.\nWe observe that the human annotators agreed that the\nthree positive generated pieces are indeed positive.

However, it is very hard to control such models in order to guide the compositions towards a desired goal. We are interested in controlling a model to automatically generate music with a given sentiment. This paper presents a generative Deep Learning model that can be directed to compose music with a given sentiment. Besides music generation, the same model can be used for sentiment analysis of symbolic music. We evaluate the accuracy of the model in classifying sentiment of symbolic music using a new dataset of video game soundtracks. Results show that our model is able to obtain good prediction accuracy. A user study shows that human subjects agreed that the generated music has the intended sentiment, however negative pieces can be ambiguous.\n\nLucas N. Ferreira University of California, Santa Cruz\n\nDepartment of Computational Media\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nMusic Generation is an important application domain of Deep Learning in which models learn musical features from a dataset in order to generate new, interesting music. Such models have been capable of generating high quality pieces of different styles with strong short-term dependencies 1[2]. A major challenge of this domain consists of disentangling these models to generate compositions with given characteristics. For example, one can't easily control a model trained on classical piano pieces to compose a tense piece for a horror scene of a movie. Being able to control the output of the models is specially important for the field of Affective Music Composition, whose major goal is to automatically generate music that is perceived to have a specific emotion or to evoke emotions in listeners [19]. Applications involve generating soundtracks for movies and video-games [18], sonification of biophysical data [3] and generating responsive music for the purposes of music therapy and palliative care [9].\n\nFootnote 1: Supporting strong long-term dependencies (music form) is still an open problem.\n\nRecently, Radford et al. [13] showed that a generative Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network can learn an excellent representation of sentiment (positive-negative) on text, despite being trained only to predict the next character in the Amazon reviews dataset [6]. When combined to a Logistic Regression, this LSTM achieves state-of-the-art sentiment analysis accuracy on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset and can match the performance of previous supervised systems using 30-100x fewer labeled examples. This LSTM stores almost all of the sentiment signal in a distinct \"sentiment neuron\", which can be used to control the LSTM to generate sentences with a given sentiment. In this paper, we explore this approach with the goal of composing symbolic music with a given sentiment. We also explore this approach as a sentiment classifier for symbolic music.\n\nIn order to evaluate this approach, we need a dataset of music in symbolic format that is annotated by sentiment. Even though emotion detection is an important topic in music information retrieval [7], it is typically studied on music in audio format. To the best of our knowledge, there are no datasets of symbolic music annotated according to sentiment. Therefore, we created a new dataset composed of 95 MIDI labelled piano pieces (966 phrases of 4 bars) from video game soundtracks. Each piece is annotated by 30 human subjects according to a valence-arousal (dimensional) model of emotion [15]. The sentiment of each piece is then extracted by summarizing the 30 annotations and mapping the valence axis to sentiment. The same dataset also contains another 728 non-labelled pieces, which were used for training the generative LSTM.\n\nWe combine this generative LSTM with a Logistic Regression and analyse its sentiment prediction accuracy against a traditional classification LSTM trained in a fully-supervised way. Results showed that our model (generative LSTM with Logistic Regression) outperformed the supervised LSTM by approximately 30%. We also analysed the generative capabilities of our model with a user study. Human subjects used an online annotation tool to label 3 pieces controlled to be negative and 3 pieces controlled to be positive. Results showed human annotators agree the generated positive pieces have the intended sentiment. The generated negative pieces appear to be ambiguous, having both negative and positive parts.\n\nWe believe this paper is the first work to explore sentiment analysis in symbolic music and it presents the first disentangled Deep Learning model for music generation with sentiment. Another contribution of this paper is a labelled dataset of symbolic music annotated according to sentiment. These contributions open several direction forfuture research, specially music generation with emotions as both a multi-class problem and as a regression problem. Moreover, these methods could be applied to create soundtrack generation systems for films, video games, interactive narratives, audio books, etc.\n\n## 2 Related Work\n\nThis paper is related to previous work on Affective Algorithmic Music Composition, more specifically to works that process music in symbolic form in order to generate music with a given emotion. A common approach for this problem consists of designing a rule-based system to map musical features to a given emotion in a categorical or dimensional space [19]. For example, Williams et al. [18] propose a system to generate soundtracks for video games where each game's scene graph (defining all the possible branching of scenes in the game) is annotated according to a valence-arousal model. A second-order Markov model is used to learn melodies from a dataset and are then transformed by a rule-based system to fit the annotated emotions in the graph. Davis and Mohammad [4] follow a similar approach in TransPose, a system that composes piano melodies for novels. TransPose uses a lexicon-based approach to automatically detect emotions (categorical model) in novels and a rule-based technique to create piano melodies with these emotions.\n\nThere are a few other approaches in the literature to compose music with a given emotion. Scirea et al. [16] recently presented a framework called MetaCompose designed to create background music for games in real-time. MetaCompose generates music by (i) randomly creating a chord sequence from a pre-defined chord progression graph, (ii) evolving a melody for this chord sequence using a genetic algorithm and (iii) producing an accompaniment for the melody/chord sequence combination. Monteith et al. [10] approaches Affective Algorithmic Music Composition from a Machine Learning perspective to learn melodies and rhythms from a corpus of music labeled according to a categorical model of emotion. Individual Hidden Markov models and n-grams are trained for each category to generate pitches and underlying harmonies, respectively. Rhythms are sampled randomly from examples of a given category.\n\nDeep Learning models have recently achieved high-quality results in music composition with short-term dependencies [2]. These models normally are trained on a corpus of MIDI files to predict the next note to be played based on a given note. In general, these models can't be manipulated to generate music with a given emotion. For example, in the system DeepBach, Hadjeres et al. [5] use a dependency network and a Gibbs-like sampling procedure to generate high-quality four-part chorales in the style of Bach. Roberts et at. [14] train recurrent variational autoencoder (VAEs) to reproduce short musical sequences and with a novel hierarchical decoder they are able to model long sequences with musical structure for both individual instruments and a three-piece band (lead, bass, and drums).\n\nThe majority of the deep learning models are trained to generate musical scores and not performances. Oore et al. [11] tackles this problem by training an LSTM with a new representation that supports tempo and velocity events from MIDI files. This model was trained on the Yamaha e-Piano Competition [1], which contains MIDI captures of ~1400 performances by skilled pianists. With this new representation and dataset, Oore et al. [11] generated more human-like performances when compared to previous models.\n\n## 3 Model\n\nWe propose a Deep Learning method for affective algorithmic composition that can be controlled to generate music with a given sentiment. This method is based on the work of Radford et al. [13] which generates product reviews (in textual form) with sentiment. Radford et al. [13] used a single-layer multiplicative long short-term memory (mLSTM) network [8] with 4096 units to process text as a sequence of UTF-8 encoded bytes (character-based language modeling). For each byte, the model updates its hidden state of the mLSTM and predicts a probability distribution over the next possible byte.\n\nThis mLSTM was trained on the Amazon product review dataset, which contains over 82 million product reviews from May 1996 to July 2014 amounting to over 38 billion training bytes [6]. Radford et al. [13] used the trained mLSTM to encode sentences from four different Sentiment Analysis datasets. The encoding is performed by initializing the the states to zeros and processing the sequence character-by-character. The final hidden states of the mLSTM are used as a feature representation. With the encoded datasets, Radford et al. [13] trained a simple logistic regression classifier with L1 regularization and outperformed the state-of-the-art methods at the time using 30-100x fewer labeled examples.\n\nBy inspecting the relative contributions of features on various datasets, Radford et al. [13] discovered a single unit within the mLSTM that directly corresponded to sentiment. Because the mLSTM was trained as a generative model, one can simply set the value of the sentiment unit to be positive or negative and the model generates corresponding positive or negative reviews.\n\n### Data Representation\n\nWe use the same combination of mLSTM and logistic regression to compose music with sentiment. To do this, we treat the music composition problem as a language modeling problem. Instead of characters, we represent a music piece as a sequence of words and punctuation marks from a vocabulary that represents events retrieved from the MIDI file. Sentiment is perceived in music due to several features such as melody, harmony, tempo, timbre, etc [7]. Our data representation attempts to encode a large part of these features 1 using a small set of words:\n\nFootnote 1: Constrained by the features one can extract from MIDI data.\n\n* \"n_[pitch]\": play note with given pitch number: any integer from 0 to 127.\n\n* \"d_[duration]_[dots]\": change the duration of the following notes to a given duration type with a given amount of dots. Types are breve, whole, half, quarter, eighth, 16th and 32nd. Dots can be any integer from 0 to 3.\n* \"v_[velocity]\": change the velocity of the following notes to a given velocity (loudness) number. Velocity is discretized in bins of size 4, so it can be any integer in the set \\(V=4,8,12,\\ldots,128\\).\n* \"t_[tempo]\": change the tempo of the piece to a given tempo in bpm. Tempo is also discretized in bins of size 4, so it can be any integer in the set \\(T=24,28,32,\\ldots,160\\).\n* \"\": end of time step. Each time step is one sixteenth note long.\n* \"u\": end of piece.\n\nFor example, Figure 1 shows the encoding of the first two time steps of the first measure of the Legend of Zelda - Ocarina of Time's Prelude of Light. The first time step sets the tempo to 120bpm, the velocity of the following notes to 76 and plays the D Major Triad for the duration of a whole note. The second time step sets the velocity to 84 and plays a dotted quarter A5 note. The total size of this vocabulary is 225 and it represents both the composition and performance elements of a piece (timing and dynamics).\n\n## 4 Sentiment Dataset\n\nIn order to apply the Radford et al. [13] method to compose music with sentiment, we also need a dataset of MIDI files to train the LSTM and another one to train the logistic regression. There are many good datasets of music in MIDI format in the literature. However, to the best of our knowledge, none are labelled according to sentiment. Thus, we created a new dataset called VGMIDI which is composed of 823 pieces extracted from video game soundtracks in MIDI format. We choose video game soundtracks because they are normally composed to keep the player in a certain affective state and thus they are less subjective pieces. All the pieces are piano arrangements of the soundtracks and they vary in length from 26 seconds to 3 minutes. Among these pieces, 95 are annotated according to a 2-dimensional model that represents emotion using a valence-arousal pair. Valence indicates positive versus negative emotion, and arousal indicates emotional intensity [17].\n\nWe use this valence-arousal model because it allows continuous annotation of music and because of its flexibility--one can directly map a valence-arousal (v-a) pair to a multiclass (happy, sad, surprise, etc) or a binary (positive/negative) model. Thus, the same set of labelled data permits the investigation of affective algorithmic music composition as both a classification (multiclass and/or binary) and as a regression problem. The valence-arousal model is also one of the most common dimensional models used to label emotion in music [17].\n\nAnnotating a piece according to the v-a model consists of continuously listening to the piece and deciding what valence-arousal pair best represents the emotion of that piece in each moment, producing a time-series of v-a pairs. This task is subjective, hence there is no single \"correct\" time-series for a given piece. Thus, we decided to label the pieces by asking several human subjects to listen to the pieces and then considering the average time-series as the ground truth. This process was conducted online via Amazon Mechanical Turk, where each piece was annotated by 30 subjects using a web-based tool we designed specifically for this task. Each subject annotated 2 pieces out of 95, and got rewarded USD $0.50 for performing this task.\n\n### Annotation Tool and Data Collection\n\nThe tool we designed to annotate the video game soundtracks in MIDI format is composed of five steps, each one being a single web-page. These steps are based on the methodology proposed by Soleymani et al. [17] for annotating music pieces in audio waveform. First, participants are introduced to the annotation task with a short description explaining the goal of the task and how long it should take in average. Second, they are presented to the definitions of valence and arousal. In the same page, they are asked to play two short pieces and indicate whether arousal and valence are increasing or decreasing. Moreover, we ask the annotators to write two to three sentences describing the short pieces they listened to. This page is intended to measure their understanding of the valence-arousal model and willingness to perform the task. Third, a video tutorial was made available to the annotators explaining how to use the annotation tool. Fourth, annotators are exposed to the main annotation page.\n\nThis main page has two phases: calibration and annotation. In the calibration phase, annotators listen to the first 15 seconds of the piece in order to get used to it and to define the starting point of the annotation circle. In the anno\n\nFigure 1: A short example piece encoded using our proposed representation. The encoding represents the first two time steps of the shown measure.\n\ntation phase they listen to the piece from beginning to end and label it using the annotation circle, which starts at the point defined during the calibration phase. Figure 2 shows the annotation interface for valence and arousal, where annotators click and hold the circle (with the play icon) inside the v-a model (outer circle) indicating the current emotion of the piece. In order to maximize annotators' engagement in the task, the piece is only played while they maintain a click on the play circle. In addition, basic instructions on how to use the tool are showed to the participants along with the definitions of valence and arousal. A progression bar is also showed to the annotators so they know how far they are from completing each phase. This last step (calibration and annotation) is repeated for a second piece. All of the pieces the annotators listened to are MIDI files synthesized with the \"Yamaha C5 Grand\" soundfont. Finally, after the main annotation step, participants provide demographic information including gender, age, location (country), musicianship experience and whether they previously knew the pieces they annotated.\n\n### Data Analysis\n\nThe annotation task was performed by 1425 annotators, where 55% are female and 42% are male. The other 3% classified themselves as transgender female, transgender male, genderqueer or choose not to disclose their gender. All annotators are from the United States and have an average age of approximately 31 years. Musicianship experience was assessed using a 5-point Likert scale where 1 means \"I've never studied music theory or practice\" and 5 means \"I have an undergraduate degree in music\". The average musicianship experience is 2.28. They spent on average 12 minutes and 6 seconds to annotate the 2 pieces.\n\nThe data collection process provides a time series of valence-arousal values for each piece, however to create a music sentiment dataset we only need the valence dimension, which encodes negative and positive sentiment. Thus, we consider that each piece has 30 time-series of valence values. The annotation of each piece was preprocessed, summarized into one time-series and split into \"phrases\" of same sentiment. The preprocessing is intended to remove noise caused by subjects performing the task randomly to get the reward as fast as possible. The data was preprocessed by smoothing each annotation with moving average and clustering all 30 time-series into 3 clusters (positive, negative and noise) according to the dynamic time-warping distance metric.\n\nWe consider the cluster with the highest variance to be noise cluster and so we discard it. The cluster with more time series among the two remaining ones is then selected and summarized by the mean of its time series. We split this mean into several segments with the same sentiment. This is performed by splitting the mean at all the points where the valence changes from positive to negative or vice-versa. Thus, all chunks with negative valence are considered phrases with negative sentiment and the ones with positive valence are positive phrases. Figure 3 shows an example of this three-steps process performed on a piece. All the phrases that had no notes (i.e. silence phrases) were removed. This process created a total of 966 phrases: 599 positive and 367 negative.\n\n## 5 Sentiment Analysis Evaluation\n\nTo evaluate the sentiment classification accuracy of our method (generative mLSTM + logistic regression), we compare it to a baseline method which is a traditional classification mLSTM trained in a supervised way. Our method uses unlabelled MIDI pieces to train a generative mLSTM to predict the next word in a sequence. An additional logistic regression uses the hidden states of the generative mLSTM to encode the labelled MIDI phrases and then predict sentiment. The baseline method uses only labelled MIDI phrases to train a classification mLSTM to predict the sentiment for the phrase.\n\nThe unlabelled pieces used to train the generative mLSTM were transformed in order to create additional training examples, following the methodology of Oore et al. [11]. The transformations consist of time-stretching (making each piece up to 5% faster or slower) and transposition (raising or lowering the pitch of each piece by up to a major third). We then encoded all these pieces and transformations according to our word-based representation (see Section 3.1). Finally, the encoded pieces were shuffled and\n\nFigure 3: Data analysis process used to define the final label of the phrases of a piece.\n\nFigure 2: Screenshot of the annotation tool.\n\n90% of them were used for training and 10% for testing. The training set was divided into 3 shards of similar size (approximately 18500 pieces each - 325MB) and the testing set was combined into 1 shard (approximately 5800 pieces - 95MB).\n\nWe trained the generative mLSTM with 6 different sizes (number of neurons in the mLSTM layer): 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048 and 4096. For each size, the generative mLSTM was trained for 4 epochs using the 3 training shards. Weights were updated with the Adam optimizer after processing sequences of 256 words on mini-batches of size 32. The mLSTM hidden and cell states were initialized to zero at the beginning of each shard. They were also persisted across updates to simulate full-backpropagation and allow for the forward propagation of information outside of a given sequence [13]. Each sequence is processed by an embedding layer (which is trained together with the mLSTM layer) with 64 neurons before passing through the mLSTM layer. The learning rate was set to \\(5*10^{-6}\\) at the beginning and decayed linearly (after each epoch) to zero over the course of training.\n\nWe evaluated each variation of the generative mLSTM with a forward pass on test shard using mini-batches of size 32. Table 1 shows the average 3 cross entropy loss for each variation of the generative mLSTM.\n\nFootnote 3: Each mini-batch reports one loss.\n\nThe average cross entropy loss decreases as the size of the mLSTM increases, reaching the best result (loss 1.11) when size is equal to 4096. Thus, we used the variation with 4096 neurons to proceed with the sentiment classification experiments.\n\nFollowing the methodology of Radford et al. [13], we re-encoded each of the 966 labelled phrases using the final cell states (a 4096 dimension vector) of the trained generative mLSTM-4096. The states are calculated by initializing them to zero and processing the phrase word-by-word. We plug a logistic regression into the mLSTM-4096 to turn it into a sentiment classifier. This logistic regression model was trained with regularization \"L1\" to shrink the least important of the 4096 feature weights to zero. This ends up highlighting the generative mLSTM neurons that contain most of the sentiment signal.\n\nWe compared this generative mLSTM + logistic regression approach against our baseline, the supervised mLSTM. This is an mLSTM with exactly the same architecture and size of the generative version, but trained in a fully supervised way. To train this supervised mLSTM, we used the word-based representation of the phrases, but we padded each phrase with silence (the symbol \".\") in order to equalize their length. Training parameters (learning rate and decay, epochs, batch size, etc) were the same ones of the the generative mLSTM. It is important to notice that in this case the mini-batches are formed of 32 labelled phrases and not words. We evaluate both methods using a 10-fold cross validation approach, where the test folds have no phrases that appear in the training folds. Table 2 shows the sentiment classification accuracy of both approaches.\n\nThe generative mLSTM with logistic regression achieved an accuracy of 89.83%, outperforming the supervised mLSTM by 29.48%. The supervised mLSTM accuracy of 60.35% suggests that the amount of labelled data (966 phrases) was not enough to learn a good mapping between phrases and sentiment. The accuracy of our method shows that the generative mLSTM is capable of learning, in an unsupervised way, a good representation of sentiment in symbolic music.\n\nThis is an important result, for two reasons. First, since the higher accuracy of generative mLSTM is derived from using unlabeled data, it will be easier to improve this over time using additional (less expensive) unlabeled data, instead of the supervised mLSTM approach which requires additional (expensive) labeled data. Second, because the generative mLSTM was trained to predict the next word in a sequence, it can be used as a music generator. Since it is combined with a sentiment predictor, it opens up the possibility of generating music consistent with a desired sentiment. We explore this idea in the following section.\n\n## 6 Generative Evaluation\n\nTo control the sentiment of the music generated by our mLSTM, we find the subset of neurons that contain the sentiment signal by exploring the weights of the trained logistic regression model. Since each of the 10 generative models derived from the 10 fold splits in Table 2 are themselves a full model, we use the model with the highest accuracy. As shown in Figure 4, the logistic regression trained with regularization \"L1\" uses 161 neurons out of 4096. Unlike the results of Radford et al. [13], we don't have one single neuron that stores most of the sentiment signal. Instead, we have many neurons contributing in a more balanced way. Therefore, we can't simply change the values of one neuron to control the sentiment of the output music.\n\nWe used a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize the weights of the 161 L1 neurons in order to lead our mL\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c} \\hline \\hline\n**mLSTM Neurons** & **Average Cross Entropy Loss** \\\\ \\hline\n128 & 1.80 \\\\\n256 & 1.61 \\\\\n512 & 1.41 \\\\\n1024 & 1.25 \\\\\n2048 & 1.15 \\\\\n4096 & 1.11 \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: Average cross entropy loss of the generative mLSTM with different amount of neurons.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c} \\hline \\hline\n**Method** & **Test Accuracy** \\\\ \\hline Gen. mLSTM-4096 + Log.

For each generation, the GA (i) evaluates the current population, (ii) selects 100 parents via a roulette wheel with elitism, (iii) recombines the parents (crossover) taking the average of their genes and (iv) mutates each new recombined individual (new offspring) by randomly setting each gene to an uniformly sampled random number \\(-2\\leq r\\leq 2\\).\n\nWe performed two independent executions of this GA, one to optimize the mLSTM for generating positive pieces and another one for negative pieces. Each execution optimized the individuals during 100 epochs with crossover rate of 95% and mutation rate of 10%. To calculate the fitness of each individual, we generated \\(P\\)=30 pieces with 256 words each, starting with the symbol \":\" (end of time step). The optimization for positive and negative generation resulted in best individuals with fitness \\(0.16\\) and \\(0.33\\), respectively. This means that if we add the genes of the best individual of the final population to the weights of the generative mLSTM, we generate positive pieces with 84% accuracy and negative pieces with 67% accuracy.\n\nAfter these two optimization processes, the genes of the best final individual of the positive optimization were added to the weights of the 161 L1 neurons of the trained generative mLSTM. We then generated 30 pieces with 1000 words starting with the symbol \":\" (end of time step) and randomly selected 3 of them. The same process was repeated using the genes of the best final individual of the negative execution. We asked annotators to label this 6 generated pieces via Amazon MTurk, using the the same methodology described in Section 4.1. Figure 5 shows the average valence per measure of each of the generated pieces.\n\nWe observe that the human annotators agreed that the three positive generated pieces are indeed positive. The generated negative pieces are more ambiguous, having both negative and positive measures. However, as a whole the negative pieces have lower valence than the positive ones. This suggests that the best negative individual (with fitness \\(0.33\\)) encountered by the GA wasn't good enough to control the mLSTM to generate complete negative pieces. Moreover, the challenge to optimize the L1 neurons suggests that there are more positive pieces than negative ones in the 3 shards used to train the generative mLSTM.\n\n## 7 Conclusion and Future Work\n\nThis paper presented a generative mLSTM that can be controlled to generate symbolic music with a given sentiment. The mLSTM is controlled by optimizing the weights of specific neurons that are responsible for the sentiment signal. Such neurons are found plugging a Logistic Regression to the mLSTM and training the Logistic Regression to classify sentiment of symbolic music encoded with the mLSTM hidden states. We evaluated this model both as a generator and as a sentiment classifier. Results showed that our model obtained good classification accuracy, outperforming a equivalent LSTM trained in a fully supervised way. Moreover, a user study showed that humans agree that our model can generate positive and negative music, with the caveat that the negative pieces are more ambiguous.\n\nIn the future, we plan to improve our model to generate less ambiguous negative pieces. Another future work consists of expanding the model to generate music with a given emotion (e.g. happy, sad, suspenseful, etc.) as well as with a given valence-arousal pair (real numbers). We also plan to use this model to compose soundtracks in real-time for oral storytelling experiences [12].\n\nFigure 4: Weights of 161 L1 neurons.

In this paper,\nwe present a comparative study evaluating and comparing the performance of a set\nof canonical approaches to this task, including a template matching based model, a\nhidden Markov based model, a genetic algorithm based model, and two deep learning\nbased models. The evaluation is conducted on a dataset of 9,226 melody/chord\npairs we newly collect for this study, considering up to 48 triad chords, using a\nstandardized training/test split. We report the result of an objective evaluation\nusing six different metrics and a subjective study with 202 participants.\nKEYWORDS\nSymbolic music generation; automatic melody harmonization; functional harmony\n1. Introduction\nAutomatic\nmelody\nharmonization,\na\nsub-task\nof\nautomatic\nmusic\ngeneration\n(Fern\u00b4andez & Vico, 2013), refers to the task of creating computational models that\ncan generate a harmonic accompaniment for a given melody (Chuan & Chew, 2007;\nSimon, Morris, & Basu, 2008). Here, the term harmony, or harmonization, is used to\nrefer to chordal accompaniment, where an accompaniment is defined relative to the\nmelody as the supporting section of the music. Figure 1 illustrates the inputs and\noutputs for a melody harmonization model.\nMelody harmonization is a challenging task as there are multiple ways to harmonize\nthe same melody; what makes a particular harmonization pleasant is subjective, and\noften dependent on musical genre and other contextual factors. Tonal music, which\nencompasses most of Western music, defines specific motivic relations between chords\nbased on scales such as those defined in functional harmony (Riemann, 1893). While\nthese relations still stand and are taught today, their application towards creating\nYeh, Hsiao, Liu, Dong and Yang are with Academia Sinica, Taiwan ({ycyeh, wayne391, paul115236,\nsalu133445,\nyang}@citi.sinica.edu.tw);\nFukayama\nis\nwith\nNational\nInstitute\nof\nAdvanced\nIndustrial\nScience\nand\nTechnology,\nJapan\n(satoru\ns.fukayama@aist.go.jp);\nKitahara\nis\nwith\nNihon\nUniversity,\nJapan\n(kitahara@chs.nihon-u.ac.jp);\nGenchel\nis\nwith\nGeorgia\nInstitute\nof\nTechnology,\nUSA\n(benjiegenchel@gmail.com);\nChen\nand\nLeong\nare\nwith\nKKBOX\nInc.,\nTaiwan\n(annchen@kkbox.com,\nterenceleong@kkboxgroup.com)\narXiv:2001.02360v3  [cs.SD]  27 Apr 2021\n\fFigure 1.\nDiagram of the slightly modified version of the bidirectional long short-term memory network\n(BiLSTM) based model (Lim et al., 2017) for melody harmonization. The input to the model is a melody\nsequence. With two layers of BiLSTM and one fully-connected (FC) layer, the model generates as output a\nsequence of chord labels (e.g., Cm or B chords), one for each half bar. See Section 2.4 for details.\npleasant music often depends on subtleties, long term dependencies and cultural contexts which may be readily accessible to a human composer, but very difficult to learn\nand detect for a machine. While a particular harmonization may be deemed technically\ncorrect in some cases, it can also be seen as uninteresting in a modern context.\nThere have been several efforts made towards this task in the past (Makris, Kayrdis,\n& Sioutas, 2016). Before the rise of deep learning, the most actively employed approach\nis based on hidden Markov models (HMMs). For example, Paiement, Eck, and Bengio (2006) proposed a tree-structured HMM that allows for learning the non-local\ndependencies of chords, and encoded probabilities for chord substitution taken from\npsycho-acoustics. They additionally presented a novel representation for chords that\nencodes relative scale degrees rather than absolute note values, and included a subgraph in their model specifically for processing it. Tsushima, Nakamura, Itoyama,\nand Yoshii (2017) similarly presented a hierarchical tree-structured model combining\nprobabilistic context-free grammars (PCFG) for chord symbols and HMMs for chord\nrhythms. Temperley (2009) presented a statistical model that would generate and\nanalyze music along three sub-structures: metrical structure, harmonic structure, and\nstream structure. In the generative portion of this model, a metrical structure defining\nthe emphasis of beats and sub-beats is first generated, and then harmonic structure\nand progression are generated conditioned on that metrical structure.\nThere are several previous works which attempt to formally and probabilistically\nanalyze tonal harmony and harmonic structure. For example, Rohrmeier and Cross\n(2008) applied a number of statistical techniques to harmony in Bach chorales in order\nto uncover a proposed underlying harmonic syntax that naturally produces common\nperceptual and music theoretic patterns including functional harmony. Jacoby, Tishby,\nand Tymoczko (2015) attempted to categorize common harmonic symbols (scale degrees, roman numerals, or sets of simultaneous notes) into higher level functional\n2\n\fgroups, seeking underlying patterns that produce and generalize functional harmony.\nTsushima, Nakamura, Itoyama, and Yoshii (2018) used unsupervised learning in training generative HMM and PCFG models for harmonization, showing that the patterns\nlearned by these models match the categorizations presented by functional harmony.\nMore lately, people have begun to explore the use of deep learning for a variety of\nmusic generation tasks (Briot, Hadjeres, & Pachet, 2017). For melody harmonication,\nLim et al. (2017) proposed a model that employed two bidirectional long short-term\nmemory (BiLSTM) recurrent layers (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) and one fullyconnected layer to learn the correspondence between pairs of melody and chord sequences. The model architecture is depicted in Figure 1. According to the experiments\nreported in (Lim et al., 2017), this model outperforms a simple HMM model and a\nmore complicated DNN-HMM model (Hinton et al., 2012) for melody harmonization\nwith major and minor triad chords.\nMoreover, melody harmonization is also relevant to four-part chorale harmonization (Allan & Williams, 2005; Ebcio\u02c7glu, 1988; Hadjeres & Pachet, 2017; C.Z. A. Huang, Cooijmans, Roberts, Courville, & Eck, 2017) and accompaniment generation (Chuan & Chew, 2007; Dong, Hsiao, Yang, & Yang, 2018; Simon et al., 2008).\nAlthough these three tasks share the same input, monophonic melodies, they have\ndistinct outputs\u2014lead sheets, four-part chorales and full arrangements, respectively.\nAnother relevant topic is harmonic analysis (T.-P. Chen & Su, 2018; De Haas, Magalh\u02dcaes, Wiering, & Veltkamp, 2014; Harte, Sandler, & Gasser, 2006; Raphael & Stoddard, 2004; Temperley, 2009). Despite having similar input and output spaces, melody\nharmonization is fundamentally different from harmonic analysis. On one hand, harmonic analysis takes polyphonic music as inputs, while melody harmonization takes\nmonophonic melodies as inputs and is considered more difficult as less harmonic information is given. On the other hand, there is in general a correct answer for harmonic\nanalysis, while there are no strict answers for melody harmonization.\nWe note that, while many new models are being proposed for melody harmonization,\nat present there is no comparative study evaluating a wide array of different approaches\nfor this task, using the same training set and test set. Comparing models trained on\ndifferent training sets is problematic as it is hard to have a standardized definition of\nimprovement and quality. Moreover, as there is to date no standardized test set for\nthis task, it is hard to make consistent comparison between different models.\nIn this paper, we aim to bridge this gap with the following three contributions:\n(1) We implement in total five melody harmonization models that span a number of\ncanonical approaches to the task, including template matching, hidden Markov\nmodel (HMM) (Simon et al., 2008), genetic algorithm (GA) (Kitahara, Giraldo,\n& Ramirez, 2018), and two variants of deep recurrent neural network (RNN)\nmodels (Lim et al., 2017). We then present a comparative study comparing the\nperformance of these models. To our best knowledge, a comparative study that\nconsiders such a diverse set of approaches for melody harmonization using a\nstandardized dataset has not been attempted before.\nAs we follow fairly faithfully the implementation proposed in the original\npublications, these models differ in terms of not only the model architectures but\nalso the employed features. Therefore, we have to admit that our study cannot\ndecouple the effects of the model architectures and the features. Yet, we note\nthat the comparison of the first four models is an architecture-vs-architecture\ncomparison, while the comparison of the two RNN models is a feature-vs-feature\ncomparison.\n3\n\f(2) We compile a new dataset, called the Hooktheory Pianoroll Triad Dataset\n(HTPD3), to evaluate the implemented models over well-annotated lead sheet\nsamples of music. A lead sheet is a form of musical notation that specifies the\nessential elements of a song\u2014the melody, harmony, and where present, lyrics\n(Liu & Yang, 2018). HTPD3 provides melody lines and accompanying chords\nspecifying both chord symbol and harmonic function useful for our study. We\nconsider 48 triad chords in this study, including major, minor, diminished, and\naugmented triad chords.\nWe use the same training split of HTPD3 to train the implemented models\nand evaluate them on the same test split.\n(3) We employ six objective metrics for evaluating the performance of melody harmonization models. These metrics consider either the distribution of chord labels\nin a chord sequence, or how the generated chord sequence fits with the given\nmelody. In addition, we conduct an online user study and collect the feedback\nfrom 202 participants around the world to assess the quality of the generated\nchordal accompaniment.\nWe discuss the findings of comparative study, hoping to gain insights into the\nstrength and weakness of the evaluated methods. Moreover, we show that incorporating the idea of functional harmony (T.-P. Chen & Su, 2018) while harmonizing\nmelodies greatly improves the result of the model presented by (Lim et al., 2017).\nIn what follows, we present in Section 2 the models we consider and evaluate in\nthis comparative study. Section 3 provides the details of the HTPD3 dataset we build\nfor this study, and Section 4 the objective metrics we consider. Section 5 presents the\nsetup and result of the study. We discuss the findings and limtiations of this study in\nSection 6, and then conclude the paper in Section 7.\n2. Automatic Melody Harmonization Models\nA melody harmonization model takes a melody sequence of T bars as input and generates a corresponding chord sequence as output. Chord Sequence is defined here as a\nseries of chord labels Y = y1, y2, . . . , yM, where M denotes the length of the sequence.\nIn this work, each model predicts a chord label for every half bar, i.e. M = 2T. Each\nlabel yj is chosen from a finite chord vocabulary C. To reduce the complexity of this\ntask, we consider here only the triad chords, i.e., chords composed of three notes.\nSpecifically, we consider major, minor, diminished, and augmented triad chords, all\nin root position. We also consider No Chord (N.C.), or rest, so the size of the chord\nvocabulary is |C| = 49. Melody Sequence is a time-series of monophonic musical notes\nin MIDI format. We compute a sequence of features as X = x1, x2, . . . , xN to represent\nthe melody and use them as the inputs to our models. Unless otherwise specified, we\nset N = M, computing a feature vector for each half bar.\nGiven a set of melody and corresponding chord sequences, a melody harmonization\nmodel f(\u00b7) can be trained by minimizing the loss computed between the ground truth\nY\u2217 and the model output \u02c6Y\u2217 = f(X\u2217), where X\u2217 is the input melody.\nWe consider three non-deep learning based and two deep learning based models in\nthis study. While the majority are adaptation of existing methods, one (deep learning\nbased) is a novel method which we introduce in this paper (see Section 2.5). All models\nare carefully implemented and trained using the training split of HTPD3. We present\nthe technical details of these models below.\n4\n\f2.1. Template Matching-based Model\nThis model is based on an early work on audio-based chord recognition (Fujishima,\n1999). The model segments training melodies into half-bars, and constructs a pitch\nprofile for each segment. The chord label for a new segment is then selected based on\nthe label for the training segment whose pitch profile it most closely matches. When\nthere is more than one possible chord template that has the highest matching score,\nwe choose a chord randomly based on uniform distribution among the possibilities. We\nrefer to this model as template matching-based as the underlying method compares\nthe profile of a given melody segment with those of the template chords.\nWe use Fujishima\u2019s pitch class profile (PCP) (Fujishima, 1999) as the pitch profile\nrepresenting respectively the melody and chord for each half-bar. A PCP is a 12dimensional feature vector x \u2208 [0, 1]12 where each element corresponds to the activity\nof a pitch class. The PCP for each of the |C| chord labels is constructed by setting\nthe elements corresponding to the pitch classes that are part of the chord to one, and\nall the others to zero. Because we consider only triad chords in this work, there will\nbe exactly three one\u2019s in the PCP of a chord label for each half bar. The PCP for\nmelody is constructed similarly, but additionally considering the duration of notes.\nSpecifically, the activity of the k-th pitch class, i.e., xk \u2208 [0, 1], is set by the ratio of\ntime the pitch class is active during the corresponding half bar.\nThe result of this model are more conservative by design, featuring intensive use\nof chord tones. And, this model sets the chord label independently for each half bar,\nwithout considering the neighboring chord labels, or the chord progression over time.\nWe note that, to remove the effect of the input representations on the harmonization\nresult, we use PCP as the model input representation for all the other models we\nimplement for melody harmonizationm.\n2.2. HMM-based Model\nHMM is a probabilistic framework for modeling sequences with latent or hidden variables. Our HMM-based harmonization model regards chord labels as latent variables\nand estimates the most likely chord sequence for a given set of melody notes. Unlike\nthe template matching-based model, this model considers the relationship between\nneighboring chord labels. HMM-based models similar to this one were widely used in\nchord generation and melody harmonization research before the current era of deep\nlearning (Raczy\u00b4nski, Fukayama, & Vincent, 2013; Simon et al., 2008).\nWe adopt a simple HMM architecture employed in (Lim et al., 2017). This model\nmakes the following assumptions:\n1. The observed melody sequence X = x1, . . . , xM is statistically biased due to the\nhidden chord sequence Y = y1, . . . , yM, which is to be estimated.\n2. xm depends on only ym, \u2200m \u2208 [1, M].\n3. ym depends on only ym\u22121, \u2200m \u2208 [2, M].\nThe task is to estimate the most likely hidden sequence \u02c6Y = \u02c6y1, . . . , \u02c6yM given X. This\namounts to maximizing the posterior probability:\n\u02c6Y\n=\narg max\nY\nP(Y |X) = arg max\nY\nP(X|Y )P(Y )\n=\narg max\nY\nM\n\ufffd\nm=1\nP(xm|ym)P(ym|ym\u22121),\n(1)\n5\n\fwhere P(y1|y0) is equal to P(y1). The term P(xm|ym) is also called the emission probability, and the term P(ym|ym\u22121) is called the transition probability. This optimization\nproblem can be solved by the Viterbi algorithm (Forney, 1973).\nDeparting from the HMM in (Lim et al., 2017), our implementation uses the PCPs\ndescribed in Section 2.1 to represent melody notes, i.e., to compute xm. Accordingly,\nwe use multivariate Gaussian distributions to model the emission probabilities, as\ndemonstrated by Fujishima (Sheh & Ellis, 2003). For each chord label, we set the\ncovariance matrix of the corresponding Gaussian distribution to be a diagonal matrix,\nand calculate the mean and variance for each dimension from the PCP features of\nmelody segments that are associated with that chord label in the training set.\nTo calculate the transition probabilities, we count the number of transitions between\nsuccessive chord labels (i.e., bi-grams), then normalize those counts to sum to one\nfor each preceding chord label. A uniform distribution is used when there is no bigram count for the preceding chord label. To avoid zero probabilities, we smooth the\ndistribution by interpolating P(ym|ym\u22121) with the prior probability P(ym) as follows,\nP \u2032(ym|ym\u22121) = (1 \u2212 \u03b2)P(ym) + \u03b2P(ym|ym\u22121) ,\n(2)\nyielding the revised transition probability P \u2032(ym|ym\u22121). The hyperparameter \u03b2 is empirically set to 0.08 via experiments on a random 10% subset of the training set.\n2.3. Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based Model\nA GA is a flexible algorithm that generally maximizes an objective function or fitness\nfunction. GAs have been used for melody generation and harmonization in the past\n(de Le\u00b4on, I\u02dcnesta, Calvo-Zaragoza, & Rizo, 2016; Phon-Amnuaisuk & Wiggins, 1999),\njustifying their inclusion in this study. A GA can be used in both rule-based and probabilistic approaches. In the former case, we need to design a rule set of what conditions\nmust be satisfied for musically acceptable melodies or harmonies\u2014the fitness function\nis formulated based on this rule set. In the latter, the fitness function is formulated\nbased on statistics of a data set.\nHere, we design a GA-based melody harmonization model by adapting the GAbased melody generation model proposed by (Kitahara et al., 2018). Unlike the other\nimplemented models, the GA-based model takes as input a computed feature vector\nfor every 16-th note (i.e., 1/4 beats). Thus, the melody representation has a temporal\nresolution 8 times that of the chord progression (i.e., N = 8M). This means that x8m\nand ym point to the same temporal position.\nOur model uses a probabilistic approach, determining a fitness function based on\nthe following elements. First, the (logarithmic) conditional probability of the chord\nprogression given the melody is represented as:\nF1(X, Y ) =\nN\n\ufffd\nn=1\nlog P(y\u2308n/8\u2309|xn),\n(3)\nwhere \u2308 \u2309 is the ceiling function. The chord transition probability is computed as:\nF2(Y ) =\nM\n\ufffd\nm=3\nlog P(ym|ym\u22122, ym\u22121) .\n(4)\n6\n\fThe conditional probability of each chord given its temporal position is defined as:\nF3(Y ) =\nM\n\ufffd\nm=1\nlog P(ym|Posm) ,\n(5)\nwhere Posm is the temporal position of the chord ym. For simplicity, we defined Posm =\nmod(m, 8), where mod is the modulo function. With this term, the model may learn\nthat the tonic chord tends to appear at the first half of the first bar, while the dominant\n(V ) chord tends to occur at the second half of the second bar.\nFinally, we use the entropy to evaluate a chord sequence\u2019s complexity, which should\nnot be too low as to avoid monotonous chord sequences. The entropy is defined as\nE(Y ) = \u2212 \ufffd\nci\u2208C P(Y = ci) log P(Y = ci). In the fitness function, we evaluate how\nlikely this entropy E(Y ) is in a given data set.\nF4(Y ) = log P(E = E(Y )) ,\n(6)\nwhere E is the random variable of the entropy of chord progressions and is discritized\nby 0.25. Its probability distribution is obtained from the training data.\nThe fitness function F(Y ) is calculated as:\nF(Y ) = w1F1(X, Y ) + w2F2(Y ) + w3F3(Y ) + w4F4(Y ) .\n(7)\nWe simply set all the weights w1, w2, w3, w4 to 1.0 here.\n2.4. Deep BiLSTM-based Model\nThis first deep learning model is adapted from the one proposed by (Lim et al.,\n2017), which uses BiLSTM layers. This model extracts contextual information from\nthe melody sequentially from both the positive and negative time directions. The original model makes chord prediction for every bar, using a vocabulary of only the major\nand minor triad chords (i.e., |C| = 24). We slightly extend this model such that the\nharmonic rhythm is a half bar, and the output chord vocabulary includes diminished\nand augmented chords, and the N.C. symbol (i.e., |C| = 49).\nAs shown in Figure 1, this model has two BiLSTM layers, followed by a fullyconnected layer. Dropout (Srivastava, Hinton, Krizhevsky, Sutskever, & Salakhutdinov, 2014) is applied with probability 0.2 at the output layer. This dropout rate, as\nwell as the number of hidden layers and hidden units, are empirically chosen by maximizing the chord prediction accuracy on a random held-out subset of the training set.\nWe train the model using minibatch gradient descent with categorical cross entropy as\nthe the cost function. We use Adam as the optimizer and regularize by early stopping\nat the 10-th epoch to prevent over-fitting.\n2.5. Deep Multitask Model: MTHarmonizer\nFrom our empirical observation on the samples generated by the aforementioned BiLSTM model, we find that the model has two main defects for longer phrases:\n(1) overuse of common chords\u2014common chords like C, F, and G major are\nrepeated and overused, making the chord progression monotonous.\n7\n\f(2) incorrect phrasing\u2014non-congruent phrasing between the melody and chords\nsimilarly results from the frequent occurrence of common chords. The resulting\nfrequent occurrence of progressions like F\u2192C or G\u2192C in generated sequences\nimplies a musical cadence in an unfit location, potentially bringing an unnecessary sense of ending in the middle of a chord sequence.\nWe propose an extension of the BiLSTM model to address these two defects. The\ncore idea is to train the model to predict not only the chord labels but also the chord\nfunctions (T.-P. Chen & Su, 2018), as illustrated in Figure 2. We call the resulting\nmodel a deep multitask model, or MTHarmonizer, since it deals with two tasks at the\nsame time. We note that the use of the chord functions for melody harmonization has\nbeen found useful by Tsushima et al. (2018), using an HMM-based model.\nFunctional harmony elaborates the relationship between chords and scales, and\ndescribes how harmonic motion guides musical perception and emotion (T.-P. Chen &\nSu, 2018). While a chord progression consisting of randomly selected chords generally\nfeels aimless, chord progressions which follow the rules of functional harmony establish\nor contradict a tonality. Music theorists annotate each scale degree into functions,\nsuch as tonic and dominant, based on the association between chord and degree in a\nparticular scale. These functions explain the role a given scale degree, and its associated\nchord relative to the scale, plays in musical phrasing and composition. Specifically, we\nconsider the following functions:\n\u2022 The tonic function serves to stabilize and reinforce the tonal center.\n\u2022 The dominant function provides a strong sense of motion back to tonal center.\nFor example, a progression that moves from a dominant function scale degree\nchord to a tonal scale degree chord first creates tension, then resolves it.\n\u2022 The others that encompasses all the other chords that are neither tonic nor\ndominant, such as the subdominant chords.\nAs will be introduced in Section 3, all the pieces in HTPD3 are in either C Major\nor c minor. Therefore, all chords share the same tonal center. We can directly map the\nchords into \u2018tonic,\u2019 \u2018dominant,\u2019 and \u2018others\u2019 functional groups, by name, without worrying about their relative functions in other keys, for other tonal centers. Specifically,\nwe consider C, Am, Cm, A as tonic chords, and G and B diminished as dominant\nchords. The other chords all fall into the others category.\nWe identify two potential benefits of adding chord functions to the target output.\nFirst, in contrast to the distribution of chord labels, the distribution of chord functions\nis relatively balanced, making it easier for the model to learn the chord functions.\nSecond, as the chord functions and chord labels are interdependent, adding the chord\nfunctions as a target informs the model which chord labels share the same function and\nmay therefore be interchangeable. We hypothesize that this multi-task learning will\nhelp our model learn proper functional progression, which in turn will produce better\nharmonic phrasing relative to the melody. Specifically, the loss function is defined as:\nL\u2217\n=\nLchord + \u03b3Lfunction\n=\nH( \u02c6Ychord, Ychord) + \u03b3H( \u02c6Yfunction, Yfunction)\n=\nH(f(X), Ychord) + \u03b3H(g(X), Yfunction) ,\n(8)\nwhere H(\u00b7) denotes the categorical cross entropy function, f(\u00b7) the chord label prediction branch, and g(\u00b7) the chord function prediction branch. When \u03b3 = 0, the model\nreduces to the uni-task model proposed by Lim et al. (2017), and we can simply write\n8\n\fFigure 2.\nDiagram of the proposed MTHarmonizer, a deep multitask model extended from the model (Lim\net al., 2017) depicted in Figure 1. See Section 2.5 for details.\nYchord as Y . In our work, we set \u03b3 = 1.5 to ensure the loss value from Lchord and\nLfunction are equally scaled. The two branches f and g share the two BiLSTM layers\nbut not the fully-connected layer. Empirically, we found that if \u03b3 is too small, the\nmodel will tend to harmonize the melody with the chords with tonic and dominant\nfunctions; the resulting chord sequences would therefore lack diversity.\nThe outputs of f and g are likelihood values for each chord label and chord function\ngiven an input melody. As Figure 2 shows, in predicting the final chord sequence, we\nrely on a weighted combination of the outputs of f and g in the following way:\n\u02c6Y = arg max\n\u02c6y1,\u02c6y2,...,\u02c6yM\nM\n\ufffd\nm=1\n(P(\u02c6ym = f(xm)) \u2217 \u03b1mP(\u02c6ym = h(g(xm)))) ,\n(9)\nwhere h(\u00b7) is simply a look-up table that maps the three chord functions to the |C|\nchord labels, and \u03b1m is a pre-defined hyperparameter that allows us to boost the\nimportance of correctly predicting the chord function over that of correctly predicting\nthe chord label, for each chord. In our implementation, we set \u03b1m = 1.0 for the tonic\nand dominant chords, and \u03b1m = 1.8 for the other chords, to encourage the model to\nselect chord labels that have lower likelihood, i.e., to use the \u201cothers\u201d chords. This\nwould more likely affect the middle part of a chord sequence, because this is where the\nlikelihood to observe a chord from the three functions to be likely similar, so applying\ndifferent \u03b1m makes a difference. In contrast, in the beginning or the end of a phrase,\nthe likelihood of observing the \u201cothers\u201d chords would tend to be low anyway, even\nafter we boost it with \u03b1m. As we will mainly add diversity to the middle part of a\nchord sequence, we would not compromise the overall chord progression and phrasing.\n9\n\f3. Proposed Dataset\nFor the purpose of this study, we firstly collect a new dataset called the Hooktheory Lead Sheet Dataset (HLSD), which consists of lead sheet samples scraped from\nthe online music theory forum called TheoryTab, hosted by Hooktheory (https://\nwww.hooktheory.com/theorytab), a company that produces pedagogical music software and books. The majority of lead sheet samples found on TheoryTab are usercontributed.1 Each piece contains high-quality, human-transcribed melodies alongside\ntheir corresponding chord progressions, which are specified by both literal chord symbols (e.g., Gmaj7), and chord functions (e.g., VI7) relative to the provided key.Chord\nsymbols specify inversion if applicable, and the full set of chord extensions (e.g., #9,\nb11). The metric timing/placement of the chords is also provided. Due to copyright\nconcerns, TheoryTab prohibits uploading full length songs. Instead, users upload snippets of a song (here referred to as lead sheet samples), which they voluntarily annotate\nwith structural labels (e.g. \u201cIntro,\u201d \u201cVerse,\u201d and \u201cChorus\u201d) and genre labels. A music\npiece can be associated with multiple genres.\nAs the samples in this dataset are segments of pop songs, e.g., a verse or a chorus,\ntemporary changes of the tonal center should be rare.\nWe note that HLSD contains music of various genres, and only a few of them are\nclassical music.2 As discussed in (de Clercq & Temperley, 2011), the rules of classical\nharmony are much less often followed in pop music. In addition, melodies in pop/rock\nmusic are more independent of the harmony than the case in classical music (Nobile,\n2015; Temperley, 2007). It therefore remains to be studied whether the consideration\nof functional harmony improves our task here.\nHLSD contains 11,329 lead sheets samples, all in 4/4 time signature. It contains up\nto 704 different chord classes, which is deemed too many for the current study. We\ntherefore take the following steps to process and simplify HLSD, resulting in the final\nHTPD3 dataset employed in the performance study.\n\u2022 We remove lead sheet samples that do not contain a sufficient number of notes.\nSpecifically, we remove samples whose melodies comprise of more than 40% rests\n(relative to their lengths). One can think of this as correcting class imbalance,\nanother common issue for machine learning models\u2014if the model sees too much\nof a single event, it may overfit and only produce or classify that event.\n\u2022 We then filter out lead sheets that are less than 4 bars and longer than 32 bars, so\nthat 4 \u2264 T \u2264 32. This is done because 4 bars is commonly seen as the minimum\nlength for a complete musical phrase in 4/4 time signature. At the other end, 32\nbars is a common length for a full lead sheet, one that is relatively long. Hence,\nas the majority of our dataset consists of mere song sections, we are inclined for\nnot including samples longer than 32 bars.\n\u2022 The HLSD provides the key signatures of every samples. We transpose every\nsamples to either C major or c minor based on the provided key signatures.\n\u2022 In general, a chord label can be specified by the pitch class of its root note (among\n1We note that we do not own the copyrights of the lead sheets so we cannot further redistribute them. We\ncollected the lead sheets only for academic research.\n2Here is a random sample of 10 songs from the dataset: Love Grows Where My Rosemary Goes by Edison\nLighthouse (1972), La Bamba by Ritchie Valen (1987), Palm Tree Paradise-Wario Land 4 by Ryoji Yoshitomi\n(2001), Forever and Always by Taylor Swift (2008), Trails of the Past by Sbtrkt (2011), I\u2019ve Run Away to\nJoin the Fairies by Magnetic Fields (2012), Semi Automatic by Twenty One Pilots (2013), Adventure of A\nLifetime by Coldplay (2015), Same Drugs by Chance the Rapper (2016), Feel Good-Brooks Remix by Gryffin\nAnd Illenium (2017).\n10\n\f12 possible pitch classes, i.e., C, C#, . . . , B, in a chromatic scale), and its chord\nquality, such as \u2018triad\u2019, \u2018sixths\u2019, \u2018sevenths\u2019, and \u2018suspended.\u2019 HLSD contains 704\npossible chord labels, including inversions. However, the distribution of these\nlabels is highly skewed. In order to even out the distribution and simplify our\ntask, we reduce the chord vocabulary by converting each label to its root position\ntriad form, i.e., the major, minor, diminished, and augmented chords without\n7ths or additional extensions. Suspended chords are mapped to the major and\nminor chords. As a result, only 48 chord labels (i.e., 12 root notes by 4 qualities)\nand N.C. are considered (i.e., |C| = 49).\n\u2022 We standardize the dataset so that a chord change can occur only every bar or\nevery half bar.\nWe do admit that this simplification can decrease the chord color and reduce the\nintensity of tension/release patterns, and can sometimes convert a vibrant, subtle\nprogression into a monotonous one (e.g., because both CMaj7 and C7 are mapped to\nC chord). We plan to make full use of the original chord vocabulary in future works.\nHaving pre-defined train and test splits helps to facilitate the use of HTPD3 for\nevaluating new models of melody harmonization via the standardization of training\nprocedure. As HTPD3 includes paired melody and chord sequences, it can also be\nused to evaluate models for chord-conditioned melody generation as well. With these\nuse cases in mind, we split the dataset so that the training set contains 80% of the\npieces, and the test set contains 10% of the pieces. There are in total 923 lead sheet\nsamples in the test set. The remaining 10% is reserved for future use. When splitting,\nwe imposed the additional requirement that lead sheet samples from the same song\nare in the same subset.\n4. Proposed Objective Metrics\nTo our knowledge, there are at present no standardized, objective evaluation metrics\nfor the melody harmonization task. The only objective metric adopted by (Lim et al.,\n2017), in evaluating the models they built is a categorical cross entropy-based chord\nprediction error, representing the discrepancy between the ground truth chords Y\u2217\nand predicted chords \u02c6Y\u2217 = f(X\u2217). The chord prediction error is calculated for each\nhalf bar individually and then got averaged, not considering the chord sequence as\na whole. In addition, it does not directly measure how the generated chord sequence\nfits with the given melody. What\u2019s more, when calculating the chord prediction error,\nthe underlying assumption is that the \u201cground truth\u201d chord sequence Y\u2217 is the only\nfeasible one to harmonize the given melody X\u2217. This is not true in general.\nFor the comparative study, we introduce here a set of six objective metrics defined\nbelow. These metrics are split into two categories, namely three chord progression\nmetrics and three chord/melody harmonicity metrics. Please note that we do not\nevaluate the melody itself, as the melody is provided by the ground truth data.\nChord progression metrics evaluate each chord sequence as a whole, independent\nfrom the melody, and relate to the distribution of chord labels in a sequence.\n\u2022 Chord histogram entropy (CHE): Given a chord sequence, we create a histogram of chord occurrences with |C| bins. Then, we normalize the counts to sum\n11\n\fto 1, and calculate its entropy:\nH = \u2212\n|C|\n\ufffd\ni=1\npi log pi ,\n(10)\nwhere pi is the relative probability of the i-th bin. The entropy is greatest when\nthe histogram follows a uniform distribution, and lowest when the chord sequence\nuses only one chord throughout.\n\u2022 Chord coverage (CC): The number of chord labels with non-zero counts in the\nchord histogram in a chord sequence.\n\u2022 Chord tonal distance (CTD): The tonal distance proposed by (Harte et al.,\n2006) is a canonical way to measure the closeness of two chords. It is calculated by\nfirstly calculating the PCP features of two chords, projecting the PCP features to\na derived 6-D tonal space, and finally calculating the Euclidean distance between\nthe two 6-D feature vectors. CTD is the average value of the tonal distance\ncomputed between every pair of adjacent chords in a given chord sequence. The\nCTD is highest when there are abrupt changes in the chord progression (e.g.,\nfrom C chord to B chord).\nChord/melody harmonicity metrics, on the other hand, aims to evaluate the degree\nto which a generated chord sequence successfully harmonizes a given melody sequence.\n\u2022 Chord tone to non-chord tone ratio (CTnCTR): In reference to the chord\nsequence, we count the number of chord tones, and non-chord tones in the melody\nsequence. Chord tones are defined as melody notes whose pitch class are part of\nthe current chord (i.e., one of the three pitch classes that make up a triad) for\nthe corresponding half bar. All the other melody notes are viewed as non-chord\ntones. One way to measure the harmonicity is to simply computing the ratio\nof the number of the chord tones (nc) to the number of the non-chord tones\n(nn). However, we find it useful to further take into account the number of a\nsubset of non-chord tones (np) that are two semitones within the notes which\nare right after them, where subscript p denotes a \u201cproper\u201d non-chord tone. We\ndefine CTnCTR as\nnc + np\nnc + nn\n.\n(11)\nCTnCTR equals one when there are no non-chord tones at all, or when np = nn.\n\u2022 Pitch consonance score (PCS): For each melody note, we calculate a consonance score with each of the three notes of its corresponding chord label. The\nconsonance scores are computed based on the musical interval between the pitch\nof the melody notes and the chord notes, assuming that the pitch of the melody\nnotes is always higher. This is always the case in our implementation, because we\nalways place the chord notes lower than the melody notes. The consonance score\nis set to 1 for consonance intervals including unison, major/minor 3rd, perfect\n5th, major/minor 6th, set to 0 for a perfect 4th, and set to \u20131 for other intervals,\nwhich are considered dissonant. PCS for a pair of melody and chord sequences\nis computed by averaging these consonance scores across a 16th-note windows,\nexcluding rest periods.\n\u2022 Melody-chord tonal distance (MCTD): Extending the idea of tonal distance,\nwe represent a melody note by a PCP feature vector (which would be a one-hot\n12\n\fFigure 3.\nA harmonization example (in major key) from The Beatles: Hey Jude. We can see that, while the\nnon-deep learning models change the harmonization in different phrases, the MTharmonizer generates a V-I\nprogression nicely to close the phrase.\nvector) and compare it against the PCP of a chord label in the 6-D tonal space\n(Harte et al., 2006) to calculate the closeness between a melody note and a chord\nlabel. MCTD is the average of the tonal distance between every melody note and\ncorresponding the chord label calculated across a melody sequence, with each\ndistance weighted by the duration of the corresponding melody note.\n5. Comparative Study\nWe train all the five models described in Section 2 using the training split of HTPD3\nand then apply them to the test split of HTPD3 to get the predicted chord sequences\nfor each melody sequence. Examples of the harmonization result of the evaluated\nmodels can be found in Figures 3 and 4.\nWe note that, since one cannot judge the full potential of each algorithm only\nfrom our simplified setting of melody harmonization, we do not intend to find what\nmethod is the best in general. We rather attempt a challenge to compare different\nharmonization method which have not been directly compared because of the different\ncontext that each approach assumes.\nIn what follows, we use the harmonization result for a random subset of the test\nset comprising 100 pieces in a user study for subjective evaluation. The result of\nthis subjective evaluation is presented in Section 5.1. Then, in Section 5.2, we report\nthe results of an objective evaluation wherein we compute the mean values of the\nchord/melody harmonicity and chord progression metrics presented in Section 4 for\nthe harmonization results for each test set piece.\n13\n\fFigure 4.\nA harmonization example (in minor key) from ABBA: Gimme Gimme Gimme A Man After\nMidnight. Similar to the example shown in Figure 3, the result of the MTHarmonizer appears to be more\ndiverse and functionally correct. We also see that the result of GA is quite \u201cinteresting\u201d\u2014e.g., with nondiatonic chord D flat Major and close the music phrase with Picardy third (i.e., a major chord of the tonic at\nthe end of a chord sequence that is in a minor key). We also see that the non-deep learning methods seem to\nbe weaker in handling the tonality of music.\n5.1. Subjective Evaluation\nWe conducted an online survey where we invited human subjects to listen to and assess\nthe harmonization results of different models. The subjects evaluated the harmonizations in terms of the following criteria:\n\u2022 Harmonicity: The extent to which a chord progression successfully or pleasantly harmonizes a given melody. This is designed to correspond to what the\nmelody/chord harmonicity metrics described in Section 4 aim to measure.\n\u2022 Interestingness: The extent to which a chord progression sounds exciting, unexpected and/or generates \u201cpositive\u201d stimulation. This criterion corresponds to\nthe chord-related metrics described in Section 4. Please note that we use a less\ntechnical term \u201cinterestingness\u201d here since we intend to solicit feedback from\npeople either with or without musical backgrounds.\n\u2022 The Overall quality of the given harmonization.\nGiven a melody sequence, we have in total six candidate chord sequences to accompany it: those generated by the five models presented in Section 2, and the humancomposed, ground-truth progression retrieved directly from the test set. We intend\nto compare the results of the automatically generated progression with the original\nhuman-composed progression. Yet, given the time and cognitive load required, it was\nnot possible to ask each subject to evaluate the results of every model for every piece\nof music in the test set (there are 6 \u00d7 923 = 5, 538 sequences in total). We describe\nbelow how our user study is designed to make the evaluation feasible.\n14\n\f5.1.1. Design of the User Study\nFirst, we randomly select 100 melodies from the test set of HTPD3. For each human\nsubject, we randomly select three melody sequences from this pool, and present to the\nsubject the harmonization results of two randomly selected models for each melody\nsequence. For each of the three melodies, the subject listens to the melody without\naccompaniment first, and then the sequence with two different harmonizations. Thus,\nthe subject has to listen to nine music pieces in total: three melody sequences and the\nsix harmonized ones. As we have six methods for melody harmonization (including\nthe original human-composed harmonization), we select methods for each set of music\nsuch that each method is presented once and only once to each subject. The subjects\nare not aware of which harmonization is generated by which method, but are informed\nthat at least one of the harmonized sequence is human-composed.\nIn each set, the subject has to listen to the two harmonized sequences and decide\nwhich version is better according to the three criteria mentioned earlier. This ranking\ntask is mandatory. In addition, the subject can choose to further grade the harmonized\nsequences in a five-point Likert scale with respect to the criteria mentioned earlier.\nHere, we break \u201charmonicity\u201d into the following two criteria in order to get more\nfeedback from subjects:\n\u2022 Coherence: the coherence between the melody and the chord progression in\nterms of harmonicity and phrasing.\n\u2022 Chord Progression: how coherent, pleasant, or reasonable the chord progression is on its own, independent of the melody.\nThis optional rating task thus has four criteria in total.\nThe user study opens to an \u201cinstructions\u201d page, that informs the subjects that we\nconsider only root-positioned triad chords in the survey. Moreover, they are informed\nthat there is no \u201cground truth\u201d in melody harmonization\u2014the task is by nature subjective. After collecting a small amount of relevant personal information from the\nsubjects, we present them with a random audio sample and encourage them to put\non their headsets and adjust the volume to a comfortable level. After that, they are\nprompted to begin evaluating the three sets (i.e., one set for each melody sequence),\none-by-one on consecutive pages.\nWe spread the online survey over the Internet openly, without restriction, to solicit voluntary, non-paid participation. The webpage of the survey can be found at\nhttps://musicai.citi.sinica.edu.tw/survey mel harm/.\n5.1.2. User Study Results\nIn total, 202 participants from 16 countries took part in the survey. We had more\nmale participants than female (ratio of 1.82:1), and the average age of participants\nwas 30.8 years old. 122 participants indicated that they have music background, and\n69 of them are familiar with or expertise in the harmonic theory. The participants\ntook on average 14.2 minutes to complete the survey.\nWe performed the following two data cleaning steps: First, we discarded both the\nranking and rating results from participants who spent less than 3 minutes to complete\nthe survey, which is considered too short. Second, we disregarded rating results when\nthe relative ordering of the methods contradicted that from the ranking results. As a\nresult, 9.1% and 21% of the ranking and rating records were removed, respectively.\nWe first discuss the results of the pairwise ranking task, which is shown in Figure\n5. The following observations are made:\n15\n\f(a) Harmonicities\n(b) Interestingness\n(c) Overall\nFigure 5.\n\u201cWin probabilities\u201d of different model pairs. Each entry represents the probability that the model\nin that column scores higher than the model in that row.\n16\n\fFigure 6.\nThe mean rating scores in subjective evaluation, along with the standard deviation (the error bars).\n\u2022 The human-composed progressions have the highest \u201cwin probabilities\u201d on average in all the three ranking criteria. It performs particularly well in Harmonicity.\n\u2022 In general, the deep learning methods have higher probabilities to win over the\nnon-deep learning methods in Harmonicity and Overall.\n\u2022 For Interestingness, GA performs the best among the five automatic methods,\nwhich we suspect stems from its entropy term (Eq. (6)).\n\u2022 Among the two deep learning methods, the MTHarmonizer consistently outperforms the BiLSTM in all ranking criteria, especially for Interestingness. We\n(subjectively) observe that MTHarmonizer indeed generates more diverse chord\nprogressions compared to the vanilla BiLSTM, perhaps due to the consideration\nof functions.\nThe results of the rating task shown in Figure 6, on the other hand, lead to the\nfollowing observations:\n\u2022 Congruent with the results of the ranking task, the MTHarmonzer model\nachieves the second best performance here, only losing out to the original humancomposed chord progressions. The MTHarmonzier consistently outperforms the\nother four automatic methods in all the four metrics. With a paired t-test, we\nfind that there is significant performance difference between the MTHarmonzer\nprogressions and the original human-composed progressions in terms of Coherence and Chord Progression (p-value<0.005), but no significant difference in\nterms of Interestingness and Overall.\n\u2022 Among the four metrics, the original human-composed progressions score higher\nin Coherence (3.81) and Overall (3.78), and the lowest in Interestingness (3.43).\nThis suggests that the way we simplify the data (e.g., using only root-positioned\ntriad chords) may have limited the perceptual qualities of the music, in particular\nits diversity.\n\u2022 Generally speaking, the results in Chord Progression (i.e., the coherence of the\nchord progression on its own) seems to correlate better with the results in Coherence (i.e., the coherence between the melody and chord sequences) than the\nInterestingness of the chord progression. This suggests that a chord progression\nrated as being interesting may not sound coherent.\n\u2022 Although the GA performs worse than the MTHarmonizer on all the four metrics, it actually performs fairly well in Interestingness (3.23), as we have observed\nfrom the ranking result. A paired t-test showed no significant performance difference between the GA generated progressions and original human-composed\nprogressions in Interestingness. A hybrid model that combines GA and deep\nlearning may be a promising direction for future research.\nFrom the rating and ranking tasks, we see that, in terms of harmonicity, automatic\n17\n\fMelody/chord harmonicity metrics\nCTnCTR\nPCS\nMCTD\nHuman-composed\n0.74\n1.42\n1.03\nTemplate matching\n0.91\n1.97\n0.83\nHMM (adapted from (Lim et al., 2017))\n0.89\n1.93\n0.85\nGA-based (adapted from (Kitahara et al., 2018))\n0.74\n0.43\n1.31\nBiLSTM (adapted from (Lim et al., 2017))\n0.87\n1.84\n0.91\nMTHarmonizer (proposed here)\n0.82\n1.77\n0.94\nChord progression metrics\nCHE\nCC\nCTD\nHuman-composed\n1.28\n2.62\n0.88\nTemplate matching\n1.01\n1.70\n0.65\nHMM (adapted from (Lim et al., 2017))\n0.88\n1.89\n0.56\nGA-based (adapted from (Kitahara et al., 2018))\n1.58\n2.47\n0.96\nBiLSTM (adapted from (Lim et al., 2017))\n1.07\n2.07\n0.71\nMTHarmonizer (proposed here)\n1.29\n2.31\n1.02\nTable 1.\nObjective evaluation scores for different melody harmonization models.

And, 1) higher values in CTnCTR and PCS\nand lower values in MCTD may suggest that the melody/chord harmonicity is high; 2) higher values in CHE\nand CC and lower values in CTD may suggest that the diversity (which can be related to the interestingness)\nof the chord progression is high. See Section 4 for the definitions of the metrics.\nmethods still fall behind the human composition. However, the results of the two deep\nlearning based methods are closer to that of the human-composed ones.\n5.2. Objective Evaluation\nThe results are displayed in Table 1. We discuss the result of the melody/chord harmonicity metrics first. We can see that the results for the two deep learning methods\nare in general closer to the results for the original human-composed progressions than\nthose of the three non-deep learning methods for all three harmonicity metrics, most\nsignificantly on the latter two. The template matching-based and HMM-based methods scores high in PCS and low in MCTD, indicating that the harmonization these two\nmethods generate may be too conservative. In contrast, the GA scores low in PCS and\nhigh in MCTD, indicating overly low harmonicity. These results are consistent with\nthe subjective evaluation, suggesting that these metrics can perhaps reflect human\nperception of the harmonicity between melody and chords.\nFrom the result of the chord progression metrics, we also see from CHE and CC that\nthe progressions generated by the template matching-based and HMM-based methods\nseem to lack diversity. In contrast, the output of GA features high diversity.\nAs the GA based method was rated lower than the template matching and HMM\nmethods in terms of the Overall criterion in our subjective evaluation, it seems that\nthe subjects care more about the harmonicity than the diversity of chord progressions.\nComparing the two deep learning methods, we see that the MTHarmonizer uses\nmore non-chord tones (smaller CTnCTR) and uses a greater number of unique chords\n18\n\f(larger CC) than the BiLSTM model. The CHE of the MTHarmonizer is very close\nto that of the original human-composed progressions.\nIn general, the results of the objective evaluation appear consistent with those of the\nsubjective evaluation. It is difficult to quantify which metrics are better for what purposes, and how useful and accurate these metrics are overall. Therefore, our suggestion\nis to use them mainly to gain practical insights into the results of automatic melody\nharmonization models, rather than to judge their quality. As pointed out by (Dong et\nal., 2018), objective metrics can be used to track the performance of models during\ndevelopment, before committing to running the user study. Yet, human evaluations\nare still needed to evaluate the quality of the generated music.\nFinally, although we have argued earlier that there is no ground truth in melody\nharmonization and that it is not adequate to rely solely on chord prediction error to\nevaluate the models, we find that the MTHarmonizer also achieves the lowest chord\nprediction error (i.e., a 48-class classification problem) and chord function prediction\nerror (a 3-class classification problem). On the test set, the chord prediction accuracy\nfor the five models (template matching, HMM, GA, BiLSTM, and MTHarmonizer) is\n29%, 31%, 20%, 35%, and 38%, respectively, while the accuracy for a random guess\nbaseline is only 2%. And, the chord function prediction accuracy is 62%, 61%, 55%,\n65%, 69%, respectively, while the accuracy for a random guess baseline is 51%.\n6. Discussions\nWe admit that the comparative study presented above has some limitations. First,\nbecause of the various preprocessing steps taken for data cleaning and for making\nthe melody harmonization task manageable (cf. Section 3), the \u201chuman-composed\u201d\nharmonizations are actually simplified versions of those found on TheoryTab. We considered triad chords only, and we did not consider performance-level attributes such\nas velocity and rhythmic pattern of chords. This limits the perceptual quality of the\nhuman-composed chord progression, and therefore also limits the results that can be\nachieved by automatic methods. The reduction from extended chords to triads reduces\nthe \u201ccolor\u201d of the chords and creates many innacurate chord repetitions in the dataset\n(e.g., both the alternated CMaj7 and C7 will be reduced to C triad chord). We believe\nit is important to properly inform the human subjects of such limitations as we did in\nthe instruction phase of our user study. We plan to compile other datasets from HLSD\nto extend the comparative study in the future.\nSecond, in our user study we asked human subjects to rank and rate the results\nof two randomly chosen methods in each of the three presented sets. After analyzing\nthe results, we found that the subject\u2019s ratings are in fact relative. For example, the\nMTHarmonizer\u2019s average score in Overall is 3.04 when presented alongside the humancomposed progressions, and 3.57 when confronted with the genetic algorithm-based\nmodel. We made sure in our user study that all the methods are equally likely to be\npresented together with every other method, so the average rating scores presented in\nFigure 6 do not favor a particular method. Still, caution is needed when interpreting\nthe rating scores. Humans may not have a clear idea of how to consistently assign a\nscore to a harmonization. While it is certainly easier to objectively compare multiple\nmethods with the provided rating scores, we still recommended asking human subjects\nto make pairwise rankings in order to make the result more reliable.\nThird, as the aim of this paper is to sample representative models from the literature, the current setting cannot decouple the effects of the model architectures (e.g.,\n19\n\fHMMs, GAs and BiLSTMs) and the music knowledge induced into the model (e.g.,\nthe concept of functional harmonic in MTHarmonizer). Moreover, for similar reasons,\nthe models we implemented in this paper do not include extensions that might lead\nto better performance. For example, we could further improve the HMM model by\nusing trigrams or extending the hidden layers as discussed in the literature (Paiement\net al., 2006; Temperley, 2009; Tsushima et al., 2017). It may also be possible to incorporate some of the proposed objective metrics (such as the chord tone to non-chord\ntone ratio) as additional loss terms. The aim of this paper is to observe how different\ncategories of models characterize the harmonization results rather than to explore the\nfull potentials of each presented model.\nReviewing the properties of harmonization algorithms which imitate styles in a\ndataset as in our research still holds its importance, although recent music generation research is shifting towards measuring how systems can generate content that\nextrapolates meaningfully from what the model have learned (Zacharakis, KaliakatsosPapakostas, Tsougras, & Cambouropoulos, 2018). Extrapolation could be based on the\nmodel which also achieves interpolation or maintaining particular styles among data\npoints. We believe we can further discuss extrapolation based on the understanding\nof how methods imitate data.\n7. Conclusion\nIn this paper, we have presented a comparative study implementing and evaluating a\nnumber of canonical methods and one new method for melody harmonization, including deep learning and non-deep learning based approaches. The evaluation has been\ndone using a lead sheet dataset we newly collected for training and evaluating melody\nharmonization. In addition to conducting a subjective evaluation, we employed in total six objective metrics with which to evaluate a chord progression given a melody.\nOur evaluation shows that deep learning models indeed perform better than non-deep\nlearning ones in a variety of aspects, including harmonicity and interestingness. Moreover, a deep learning model that takes the function of chords into account reaches the\nbest result among the evaluated models.\nFuture work can be directed toward at least the following three directions. First, it is\nimportant to extend the chord vocabulary to include more complicated chords. Second,\nas self-attention based neural sequence models such as the Transformers (Vaswani\net al., 2017) have been shown powerful alternatives to RNNs for various automatic\nmusic generation tasks (Y.-H. Chen, Huang, Hsiao, & Yang, 2020; Donahue, Mao, Li,\nCottrell, & McAuley, 2019; Y.-S. Huang & Yang, 2020; Ren et al., 2020), it might be\ninteresting to investigate Transformer-based models for melody harmonization. Finally,\nother than the melody harmonization task (i.e., generating chords given a melody)\naddressed in the paper, it would also be interesting to study chord-conditioned melody\ngeneration (i.e., generating a melody given chords) (Genchel, Pati, & Lerch, 2019; Trieu\n& Keller, 2018; Yang, Chou, & Yang, 2017), or simultaneously generating both melody\nand harmony from scratch (Jiang, Xia, Carlton, Anderson, & Miyakawa, 2020; Liu &\nYang, 2018; Wu & Yang, 2020).\nReferences\nAllan, M., & Williams, C.

In this paper, we present a comparative study evaluating and comparing the performance of a set of canonical approaches to this task, including a template matching based model, a hidden Markov based model, a genetic algorithm based model, and two deep learning based models. The evaluation is conducted on a dataset of 9,226 melody/chord pairs we newly collect for this study, considering up to 48 triad chords, using a standardized training/test split. We report the result of an objective evaluation using six different metrics and a subjective study with 202 participants.\n\nS +\nFootnote \u2020: Yeh, Hsiao, Liu, Dong and Yang are with Academia Sinica, Taiwan ({ycyeb, wayne391, paul115236, salu133445, yang}@citi.sinica.edu.tw); Fukayama is with National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Japan (satoru s.fukayama@aist.go.jp); Kitahara is with Nihon University, Japan (kitahara@chs.nihon-u.ac.jp); Genchel is with Georgia Institute of Technology, USA (ben-jigenchel@gmail.com); Chen and Leong are with KKBOX Inc., Taiwan (annchen@kkbox.com, terenceleong@kkboxgroup.com)\n\nSymbolic music generation; automatic melody harmonization; functional harmony\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nAutomatic melody harmonization, a sub-task of automatic music generation (Fernandez and Vico, 2013), refers to the task of creating computational models that can generate a harmonic accompaniment for a given melody (Chuan and Chew, 2007; Simon et al., 2008). Here, the term harmony, or harmonization, is used to refer to chordal accompaniment, where an accompaniment is defined relative to the melody as the supporting section of the music. Figure 1 illustrates the inputs and outputs for a melody harmonization model.\n\nMelody harmonization is a challenging task as there are multiple ways to harmonize the same melody; what makes a particular harmonization pleasant is subjective, and often dependent on musical genre and other contextual factors. Tonal music, which encompasses most of Western music, defines specific motivic relations between chords based on scales such as those defined in functional harmony (Riemann, 1893). While these relations still stand and are taught today, their application towards creatingpleasant music often depends on subtleties, long term dependencies and cultural contexts which may be readily accessible to a human composer, but very difficult to learn and detect for a machine. While a particular harmonization may be deemed technically correct in some cases, it can also be seen as uninteresting in a modern context.\n\nThere have been several efforts made towards this task in the past (Makris, Kayrdis, & Sioutas, 2016). Before the rise of deep learning, the most actively employed approach is based on hidden Markov models (HMMs). For example, Paiement, Eck, and Bengio (2006) proposed a tree-structured HMM that allows for learning the non-local dependencies of chords, and encoded probabilities for chord substitution taken from psycho-acoustics. They additionally presented a novel representation for chords that encodes relative scale degrees rather than absolute note values, and included a subgraph in their model specifically for processing it. Tsushima, Nakamura, Itoyama, and Yoshii (2017) similarly presented a hierarchical tree-structured model combining probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFG) for chord symbols and HMMs for chord rhythms. Temperley (2009) presented a statistical model that would generate and analyze music along three sub-structures: metrical structure, harmonic structure, and stream structure. In the generative portion of this model, a metrical structure defining the emphasis of beats and sub-beats is first generated, and then harmonic structure and progression are generated conditioned on that metrical structure.\n\nThere are several previous works which attempt to formally and probabilistically analyze tonal harmony and harmonic structure. For example, Rohrmeier and Cross (2008) applied a number of statistical techniques to harmony in Bach chorales in order to uncover a proposed underlying harmonic syntax that naturally produces common perceptual and music theoretic patterns including functional harmony. Jacoby, Tishby, and Tymoczko (2015) attempted to categorize common harmonic symbols (scale degrees, roman numerals, or sets of simultaneous notes) into higher level functional\n\nFigure 1: Diagram of the slightly modified version of the bidirectional long short-term memory network (BiLSTM) based model (Lim et al., 2017) for melody harmonization. The input to the model is a melody sequence. With two layers of BiLSTM and one fully-connected (FC) layer, the model generates as output a sequence of chord labels (e.g., Cm or B chords), one for each half bar. See Section 2.4 for details.\n\ngroups, seeking underlying patterns that produce and generalize functional harmony. Tsushima, Nakamura, Itoyama, and Yoshii (2018) used unsupervised learning in training generative HMM and PCFG models for harmonization, showing that the patterns learned by these models match the categorizations presented by functional harmony.\n\nMore lately, people have begun to explore the use of deep learning for a variety of music generation tasks (Briot, Hadjeres, & Pachet, 2017). For melody harmonization, Lim et al. (2017) proposed a model that employed two bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) recurrent layers (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) and one fully-connected layer to learn the correspondence between pairs of melody and chord sequences. The model architecture is depicted in Figure 1. According to the experiments reported in (Lim et al., 2017), this model outperforms a simple HMM model and a more complicated DNN-HMM model (Hinton et al., 2012) for melody harmonization with major and minor triad chords.\n\nMoreover, melody harmonization is also relevant to four-part chorale harmonization (Allan & Williams, 2005; Ebcioglu, 1988; Hadjeres & Pachet, 2017; C.-Z. A. Huang, Cooijmans, Roberts, Courville, & Eck, 2017) and accompaniment generation (Chuan & Chew, 2007; Dong, Hsiao, Yang, & Yang, 2018; Simon et al., 2008). Although these three tasks share the same input, monophonic melodies, they have distinct outputs--lead sheets, four-part chorales and full arrangements, respectively. Another relevant topic is harmonic analysis (T.-P. Chen & Su, 2018; De Haas, Magalhaes, Wiering, & Veltkamp, 2014; Harte, Sandler, & Gasser, 2006; Raphael & Stoddard, 2004; Temperley, 2009). Despite having similar input and output spaces, melody harmonization is fundamentally different from harmonic analysis. On one hand, harmonic analysis takes polyphonic music as inputs, while melody harmonization takes monophonic melodies as inputs and is considered more difficult as less harmonic information is given. On the other hand, there is in general a correct answer for harmonic analysis, while there are no strict answers for melody harmonization.\n\nWe note that, while many new models are being proposed for melody harmonization, at present there is no comparative study evaluating a wide array of different approaches for this task, using the same training set and test set. Comparing models trained on different training sets is problematic as it is hard to have a standardized definition of improvement and quality. Moreover, as there is to date no standardized test set for this task, it is hard to make consistent comparison between different models.\n\nIn this paper, we aim to bridge this gap with the following three contributions:\n\n1. We implement in total five melody harmonization models that span a number of canonical approaches to the task, including template matching, hidden Markov model (HMM) (Simon et al., 2008), genetic algorithm (GA) (Kitahara, Giraldo, & Ramirez, 2018), and two variants of deep recurrent neural network (RNN) models (Lim et al., 2017). We then present a comparative study comparing the performance of these models. To our best knowledge, a comparative study that considers such a diverse set of approaches for melody harmonization using a standardized dataset has not been attempted before.\n\nAs we follow fairly faithfully the implementation proposed in the original publications, these models differ in terms of not only the model architectures but also the employed features. Therefore, we have to admit that our study cannot decouple the effects of the model architectures and the features. Yet, we note that the comparison of the first four models is an architecture-vs-architecture comparison, while the comparison of the two RNN models is a feature-vs-feature comparison.\n\n2. We compile a new dataset, called the Hooktheory Pianoroll Triad Dataset (HTPD3), to evaluate the implemented models over well-annotated lead sheet samples of music. A lead sheet is a form of musical notation that specifies the essential elements of a song--the melody, harmony, and where present, lyrics (Liu Yang, 2018). HTPD3 provides melody lines and accompanying chords specifying both chord symbol and harmonic function useful for our study. We consider 48 triad chords in this study, including major, minor, diminished, and augmented triad chords. We use the same training split of HTPD3 to train the implemented models and evaluate them on the same test split.\n3. We employ six objective metrics for evaluating the performance of melody harmonization models. These metrics consider either the distribution of chord labels in a chord sequence, or how the generated chord sequence fits with the given melody. In addition, we conduct an online user study and collect the feedback from 202 participants around the world to assess the quality of the generated chordal accompaniment.\n\nWe discuss the findings of comparative study, hoping to gain insights into the strength and weakness of the evaluated methods. Moreover, we show that incorporating the idea of functional harmony (T.-P. Chen and Su, 2018) while harmonizing melodies greatly improves the result of the model presented by (Lim et al., 2017).\n\nIn what follows, we present in Section 2 the models we consider and evaluate in this comparative study. Section 3 provides the details of the HTPD3 dataset we build for this study, and Section 4 the objective metrics we consider. Section 5 presents the setup and result of the study. We discuss the findings and limtiations of this study in Section 6, and then conclude the paper in Section 7.\n\n## 2 Automatic Melody Harmonization Models\n\nA melody harmonization model takes a melody sequence of \\(T\\) bars as input and generates a corresponding chord sequence as output. _Chord Sequence_ is defined here as a series of chord labels \\(Y=y_{1},y_{2},\\ldots,y_{M}\\), where \\(M\\) denotes the length of the sequence. In this work, each model predicts a chord label for every half bar, i.e. \\(M=2T\\). Each label \\(y_{j}\\) is chosen from a finite chord vocabulary \\(\\mathcal{C}\\). To reduce the complexity of this task, we consider here only the triad chords, i.e., chords composed of three notes. Specifically, we consider major, minor, diminished, and augmented triad chords, all in root position. We also consider _No Chord_ (N.C.), or rest, so the size of the chord vocabulary is \\(|\\mathcal{C}|=49\\). _Melody Sequence_ is a time-series of monophonic musical notes in MIDI format. We compute a sequence of features as \\(X=\\mathbf{x}_{1},\\mathbf{x}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{x}_{N}\\) to represent the melody and use them as the inputs to our models. Unless otherwise specified, we set \\(N=M\\), computing a feature vector for each half bar.\n\nGiven a set of melody and corresponding chord sequences, a melody harmonization model \\(f(\\cdot)\\) can be trained by minimizing the loss computed between the ground truth \\(Y_{*}\\) and the model output \\(\\hat{Y}_{*}=f(X_{*})\\), where \\(X_{*}\\) is the input melody.\n\nWe consider three non-deep learning based and two deep learning based models in this study. While the majority are adaptation of existing methods, one (deep learning based) is a novel method which we introduce in this paper (see Section 2.5). All models are carefully implemented and trained using the training split of HTPD3. We present the technical details of these models below.\n\n### Template Matching-based Model\n\nThis model is based on an early work on audio-based chord recognition (Fujishima, 1999). The model segments training melodies into half-bars, and constructs a _pitch profile_ for each segment. The chord label for a new segment is then selected based on the label for the training segment whose pitch profile it most closely matches. When there is more than one possible chord template that has the highest matching score, we choose a chord randomly based on uniform distribution among the possibilities. We refer to this model as _template matching-based_ as the underlying method compares the profile of a given melody segment with those of the _template_ chords.\n\nWe use Fujishima's _pitch class profile_ (PCP) (Fujishima, 1999) as the pitch profile representing respectively the melody and chord for each half-bar. A PCP is a 12-dimensional feature vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\in[0,1]^{12}\\) where each element corresponds to the activity of a pitch class. The PCP for each of the \\(|\\mathcal{C}|\\) chord labels is constructed by setting the elements corresponding to the pitch classes that are part of the chord to one, and all the others to zero. Because we consider only triad chords in this work, there will be exactly three one's in the PCP of a chord label for each half bar. The PCP for melody is constructed similarly, but additionally considering the duration of notes. Specifically, the activity of the \\(k\\)-th pitch class, i.e., \\(x_{k}\\in[0,1]\\), is set by the ratio of time the pitch class is active during the corresponding half bar.\n\nThe result of this model are more conservative by design, featuring intensive use of chord tones. And, this model sets the chord label independently for each half bar, without considering the neighboring chord labels, or the chord progression over time.\n\nWe note that, to remove the effect of the input representations on the harmonization result, we use PCP as the model input representation for all the other models we implement for melody harmonizationm.\n\n### HMM-based Model\n\nHMM is a probabilistic framework for modeling sequences with latent or hidden variables. Our HMM-based harmonization model regards chord labels as latent variables and estimates the most likely chord sequence for a given set of melody notes. Unlike the template matching-based model, this model considers the relationship between neighboring chord labels. HMM-based models similar to this one were widely used in chord generation and melody harmonization research before the current era of deep learning (Raczynski, Fukayama, & Vincent, 2013; Simon et al., 2008).\n\nWe adopt a simple HMM architecture employed in (Lim et al., 2017). This model makes the following assumptions:\n\n1. The observed melody sequence \\(X=\\mathbf{x}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbf{x}_{M}\\) is statistically biased due to the hidden chord sequence \\(Y=y_{1},\\ldots,y_{M}\\), which is to be estimated.\n2. \\(\\mathbf{x}_{m}\\) depends on only \\(y_{m}\\), \\(\\forall m\\in[1,M]\\).\n3. \\(y_{m}\\) depends on only \\(y_{m-1}\\), \\(\\forall m\\in[2,M]\\).\n\nThe task is to estimate the most likely hidden sequence \\(\\hat{Y}=\\hat{y}_{1},\\ldots,\\hat{y}_{M}\\) given \\(X\\). This amounts to maximizing the posterior probability:\n\n\\[\\hat{Y} = \\arg\\max_{Y}P(Y|X)\\ =\\ \\arg\\max_{Y}P(X|Y)P(Y) \\tag{1}\\] \\[= \\arg\\max_{Y}\\prod_{m=1}^{M}P(\\mathbf{x}_{m}|y_{m})P(y_{m}|y_{m-1 }),\\]where \\(P(y_{1}|y_{0})\\) is equal to \\(P(y_{1})\\). The term \\(P(\\mathbf{x}_{m}|y_{m})\\) is also called the emission probability, and the term \\(P(y_{m}|y_{m-1})\\) is called the transition probability. This optimization problem can be solved by the Viterbi algorithm (Forney, 1973).\n\nDeparting from the HMM in (Lim et al., 2017), our implementation uses the PCPs described in Section 2.1 to represent melody notes, i.e., to compute \\(\\mathbf{x}_{m}\\). Accordingly, we use multivariate Gaussian distributions to model the emission probabilities, as demonstrated by Fujishima (Sheh & Ellis, 2003). For each chord label, we set the covariance matrix of the corresponding Gaussian distribution to be a diagonal matrix, and calculate the mean and variance for each dimension from the PCP features of melody segments that are associated with that chord label in the training set.\n\nTo calculate the transition probabilities, we count the number of transitions between successive chord labels (i.e., bi-grams), then normalize those counts to sum to one for each preceding chord label. A uniform distribution is used when there is no bi-gram count for the preceding chord label. To avoid zero probabilities, we smooth the distribution by interpolating \\(P(y_{m}|y_{m-1})\\) with the prior probability \\(P(y_{m})\\) as follows,\n\n\\[P^{\\prime}(y_{m}|y_{m-1})=(1-\\beta)P(y_{m})+\\beta P(y_{m}|y_{m-1})\\,, \\tag{2}\\]\n\nyielding the revised transition probability \\(P^{\\prime}(y_{m}|y_{m-1})\\). The hyperparameter \\(\\beta\\) is empirically set to 0.08 via experiments on a random 10% subset of the training set.\n\n### Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based Model\n\nA GA is a flexible algorithm that generally maximizes an objective function or _fitness function_. GAs have been used for melody generation and harmonization in the past (de Leon, Inesta, Calvo-Zaragoza, & Rizo, 2016; Phon-Amnuaisuk & Wiggins, 1999), justifying their inclusion in this study. A GA can be used in both rule-based and probabilistic approaches. In the former case, we need to design a rule set of what conditions must be satisfied for musically acceptable melodies or harmonies--the fitness function is formulated based on this rule set. In the latter, the fitness function is formulated based on statistics of a data set.\n\nHere, we design a GA-based melody harmonization model by adapting the GA-based melody generation model proposed by (Kitahara et al., 2018). Unlike the other implemented models, the GA-based model takes as input a computed feature vector for every 16-th note (i.e., 1/4 beats). Thus, the melody representation has a temporal resolution 8 times that of the chord progression (i.e., \\(N=8M\\)). This means that \\(\\mathbf{x}_{8m}\\) and \\(y_{m}\\) point to the same temporal position.\n\nOur model uses a probabilistic approach, determining a fitness function based on the following elements. First, the (logarithmic) conditional probability of the chord progression given the melody is represented as:\n\n\\[F_{1}(X,Y)=\\sum_{n=1}^{N}\\log P(y_{\\lceil n/8\\rceil}|\\mathbf{x}_{n}), \\tag{3}\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\lceil\\ \\ \\rceil\\) is the ceiling function. The chord transition probability is computed as:\n\n\\[F_{2}(Y)=\\sum_{m=3}^{M}\\log P(y_{m}|y_{m-2},y_{m-1})\\,. \\tag{4}\\]The conditional probability of each chord given its temporal position is defined as:\n\n\\[F_{3}(Y)=\\sum_{m=1}^{M}\\log P(y_{m}|\\text{Pos}_{m})\\,, \\tag{5}\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\text{Pos}_{m}\\) is the temporal position of the chord \\(y_{m}\\). For simplicity, we defined \\(\\text{Pos}_{m}=\\text{mod}(m,8)\\), where mod is the modulo function. With this term, the model may learn that the tonic chord tends to appear at the first half of the first bar, while the dominant (\\(V\\)) chord tends to occur at the second half of the second bar.\n\nFinally, we use the entropy to evaluate a chord sequence's complexity, which should not be too low as to avoid monotonous chord sequences. The entropy is defined as \\(E(Y)=-\\sum_{c_{i}\\in\\mathcal{C}}P(Y=c_{i})\\log P(Y=c_{i})\\). In the fitness function, we evaluate how likely this entropy \\(E(Y)\\) is in a given data set.\n\n\\[F_{4}(Y)=\\log P(E=E(Y))\\,, \\tag{6}\\]\n\nwhere \\(E\\) is the random variable of the entropy of chord progressions and is discritized by \\(0.25\\). Its probability distribution is obtained from the training data.\n\nThe fitness function \\(F(Y)\\) is calculated as:\n\n\\[F(Y)=w_{1}F_{1}(X,Y)+w_{2}F_{2}(Y)+w_{3}F_{3}(Y)+w_{4}F_{4}(Y)\\,. \\tag{7}\\]\n\nWe simply set all the weights \\(w_{1},w_{2},w_{3},w_{4}\\) to \\(1.0\\) here.\n\n### Deep BiLSTM-based Model\n\nThis first deep learning model is adapted from the one proposed by (Lim et al., 2017), which uses BiLSTM layers. This model extracts contextual information from the melody sequentially from both the positive and negative time directions. The original model makes chord prediction for every bar, using a vocabulary of only the major and minor triad chords (i.e., \\(|\\mathcal{C}|=24\\)). We slightly extend this model such that the harmonic rhythm is a half bar, and the output chord vocabulary includes diminished and augmented chords, and the N.C. symbol (i.e., \\(|\\mathcal{C}|=49\\)).\n\nAs shown in Figure 1, this model has two BiLSTM layers, followed by a fully-connected layer. Dropout (Srivastava, Hinton, Krizhevsky, Sutskever, & Salakhutdinov, 2014) is applied with probability \\(0.2\\) at the output layer. This dropout rate, as well as the number of hidden layers and hidden units, are empirically chosen by maximizing the chord prediction accuracy on a random held-out subset of the training set. We train the model using minibatch gradient descent with categorical cross entropy as the the cost function. We use Adam as the optimizer and regularize by early stopping at the 10-th epoch to prevent over-fitting.\n\n### Deep Multitask Model: MTHarmorizer\n\nFrom our empirical observation on the samples generated by the aforementioned BiLSTM model, we find that the model has two main defects for longer phrases:\n\n1. **overuse of common chords**--common chords like C, F, and G major are repeated and overused, making the chord progression monotonous.\n\n2. **incorrect phrasing**--non-congruent phrasing between the melody and chords similarly results from the frequent occurrence of common chords. The resulting frequent occurrence of progressions like F\\(\\rightarrow\\)C or G\\(\\rightarrow\\)C in generated sequences implies a musical cadence in an unfit location, potentially bringing an unnecessary sense of ending in the middle of a chord sequence.\n\nWe propose an extension of the BiLSTM model to address these two defects. The core idea is to train the model to predict not only the chord labels but also the _chord functions_ (T.-P. Chen & Su, 2018), as illustrated in Figure 2. We call the resulting model a deep multitask model, or _MTHarmonizer_, since it deals with two tasks at the same time. We note that the use of the chord functions for melody harmonization has been found useful by Tsushima et al. (2018), using an HMM-based model.\n\nFunctional harmony elaborates the relationship between chords and scales, and describes how harmonic motion guides musical perception and emotion (T.-P. Chen & Su, 2018). While a chord progression consisting of randomly selected chords generally feels aimless, chord progressions which follow the rules of functional harmony establish or contradict a tonality. Music theorists annotate each scale degree into functions, such as tonic and dominant, based on the association between chord and degree in a particular scale. These functions explain the role a given scale degree, and its associated chord relative to the scale, plays in musical phrasing and composition. Specifically, we consider the following functions:\n\n* The _tonic_ function serves to stabilize and reinforce the tonal center.\n* The _dominant_ function provides a strong sense of motion back to tonal center. For example, a progression that moves from a dominant function scale degree chord to a tonal scale degree chord first creates tension, then resolves it.\n* The _others_ that encompasses all the other chords that are neither tonic nor dominant, such as the subdominant chords.\n\nAs will be introduced in Section 3, all the pieces in HTPD3 are in either C Major or c minor. Therefore, all chords share the same tonal center. We can directly map the chords into 'tonic,' 'dominant,' and 'others' functional groups, by name, without worrying about their relative functions in other keys, for other tonal centers. Specifically, we consider C, Am, Cm, A as _tonic_ chords, and G and B diminished as _dominant_ chords. The other chords all fall into the _others_ category.\n\nWe identify two potential benefits of adding chord functions to the target output. First, in contrast to the distribution of chord labels, the distribution of chord functions is relatively balanced, making it easier for the model to learn the chord functions. Second, as the chord functions and chord labels are interdependent, adding the chord functions as a target informs the model which chord labels share the same function and may therefore be interchangeable. We hypothesize that this multi-task learning will help our model learn proper functional progression, which in turn will produce better harmonic phrasing relative to the melody. Specifically, the loss function is defined as:\n\n\\[L_{*} = L_{\\text{chord}}+\\gamma L_{\\text{function}} \\tag{8}\\] \\[= H(\\hat{Y}_{\\text{chord}},Y_{\\text{chord}})+\\gamma H(\\hat{Y}_{ \\text{function}},Y_{\\text{function}})\\] \\[= H(f(X),Y_{\\text{chord}})+\\gamma H(g(X),Y_{\\text{function}})\\,,\\]\n\nwhere \\(H(\\cdot)\\) denotes the categorical cross entropy function, \\(f(\\cdot)\\) the chord label prediction branch, and \\(g(\\cdot)\\) the chord function prediction branch. When \\(\\gamma=0\\), the model reduces to the uni-task model proposed by Lim et al. (2017), and we can simply write \\(Y_{\\rm chord}\\) as \\(Y\\). In our work, we set \\(\\gamma=1.5\\) to ensure the loss value from \\(L_{\\rm chord}\\) and \\(L_{\\rm function}\\) are equally scaled. The two branches \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) share the two BiLSTM layers but not the fully-connected layer. Empirically, we found that if \\(\\gamma\\) is too small, the model will tend to harmonize the melody with the chords with tonic and dominant functions; the resulting chord sequences would therefore lack diversity.\n\nThe outputs of \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) are likelihood values for each chord label and chord function given an input melody. As Figure 2 shows, in predicting the final chord sequence, we rely on a weighted combination of the outputs of \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) in the following way:\n\n\\[\\hat{Y}=\\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{\\hat{y}_{1},\\hat{y}_{2},\\ldots,\\hat{y}_{M}} \\prod_{m=1}^{M}\\left(P(\\hat{y}_{m}=f(\\mathbf{x}_{m}))*\\alpha_{m}P(\\hat{y}_{m}=h (g(\\mathbf{x}_{m})))\\right), \\tag{9}\\]\n\nwhere \\(h(\\cdot)\\) is simply a look-up table that maps the three chord functions to the \\(|\\mathcal{C}|\\) chord labels, and \\(\\alpha_{m}\\) is a pre-defined hyperparameter that allows us to boost the importance of correctly predicting the chord function over that of correctly predicting the chord label, for each chord. In our implementation, we set \\(\\alpha_{m}=1.0\\) for the tonic and dominant chords, and \\(\\alpha_{m}=1.8\\) for the other chords, to encourage the model to select chord labels that have lower likelihood, i.e., to use the \"others\" chords. This would more likely affect the middle part of a chord sequence, because this is where the likelihood to observe a chord from the three functions to be likely similar, so applying different \\(\\alpha_{m}\\) makes a difference. In contrast, in the beginning or the end of a phrase, the likelihood of observing the \"others\" chords would tend to be low anyway, even after we boost it with \\(\\alpha_{m}\\). As we will mainly add diversity to the middle part of a chord sequence, we would not compromise the overall chord progression and phrasing.\n\nFigure 2: Diagram of the proposed MTHarmonizer, a deep multitask model extended from the model (Lim et al., 2017) depicted in Figure 1. See Section 2.5 for details.\n\n## 3 Proposed Dataset\n\nFor the purpose of this study, we firstly collect a new dataset called the Hooktheory Lead Sheet Dataset (HLSD), which consists of lead sheet samples scraped from the online music theory forum called TheoryTab, hosted by Hooktheory ([https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab](https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab)), a company that produces pedagogical music software and books. The majority of lead sheet samples found on TheoryTab are user-contributed.1 Each piece contains high-quality, human-transcribed melodies alongside their corresponding chord progressions, which are specified by both literal chord symbols (e.g., Gmaj7), and chord functions (e.g., VI7) relative to the provided key.Chord symbols specify inversion if applicable, and the full set of chord extensions (e.g., #9, b11). The metric timing/placement of the chords is also provided. Due to copyright concerns, TheoryTab prohibits uploading full length songs. Instead, users upload snippets of a song (here referred to as lead sheet samples), which they voluntarily annotate with structural labels (e.g. \"Intro,\" \"Verse,\" and \"Chorus\") and genre labels. A music piece can be associated with multiple genres.\n\nFootnote 1: We note that we do not own the copyrights of the lead sheets so we cannot further redistribute them. We collected the lead sheets only for academic research.\n\nAs the samples in this dataset are segments of pop songs, e.g., a verse or a chorus, temporary changes of the tonal center should be rare.\n\nWe note that HLSD contains music of various genres, and only a few of them are classical music.2 As discussed in (de Clercq & Temperley, 2011), the rules of classical harmony are much less often followed in pop music. In addition, melodies in pop/rock music are more independent of the harmony than the case in classical music (Nobile, 2015; Temperley, 2007). It therefore remains to be studied whether the consideration of functional harmony improves our task here.\n\nFootnote 2: Here is a random sample of 10 songs from the dataset: _Love Grows Where My Rosemary Goes_ by Edison Lighthouse (1972), _La Bamba_ by Ritchie Valen (1987), _Palm Tree Paradise-Wario Land 4_ by Ryoji Yoshitomi (2001), _Forever and Always_ by Taylor Swift (2008), _Trails of the Past_ by Sbtrkt (2011), _I\u2019ve Run Away to Join the Fairies_ by Magnetic Fields (2012), _Semi Automatic_ by Twenty One Pilots (2013), _Adventure of A Lifetime_ by Coldplay (2015), _Same Drugs_ by Chance the Rapper (2016), _Feel Good-Brooks Remix_ by Gryffin And Illenium (2017).\n\nHLSD contains 11,329 lead sheets samples, all in 4/4 time signature. It contains up to 704 different chord classes, which is deemed too many for the current study. We therefore take the following steps to process and simplify HLSD, resulting in the final HTPD3 dataset employed in the performance study.\n\n* We remove lead sheet samples that do not contain a sufficient number of notes. Specifically, we remove samples whose melodies comprise of more than 40% rests (relative to their lengths). One can think of this as correcting class imbalance, another common issue for machine learning models--if the model sees too much of a single event, it may overfit and only produce or classify that event.\n* We then filter out lead sheets that are less than 4 bars and longer than 32 bars, so that \\(4\\leq T\\leq 32\\). This is done because 4 bars is commonly seen as the minimum length for a complete musical phrase in 4/4 time signature. At the other end, 32 bars is a common length for a full lead sheet, one that is relatively long. Hence, as the majority of our dataset consists of mere song sections, we are inclined for not including samples longer than 32 bars.\n* The HLSD provides the key signatures of every samples. We transpose every samples to either C major or c minor based on the provided key signatures.\n* In general, a chord label can be specified by the pitch class of its root note (among12 possible pitch classes, i.e., C, C#,..., B, in a chromatic scale), and its chord quality, such as 'triad','sixths','sevenths', and'suspended.' HLSD contains 704 possible chord labels, including inversions. However, the distribution of these labels is highly skewed. In order to even out the distribution and simplify our task, we reduce the chord vocabulary by converting each label to its root position triad form, i.e., the major, minor, diminished, and augmented chords without 7ths or additional extensions. Suspended chords are mapped to the major and minor chords. As a result, only 48 chord labels (i.e., 12 root notes by 4 qualities) and N.C. are considered (i.e., \\(|\\mathcal{C}|=49\\)).\n* We standardize the dataset so that a chord change can occur only every bar or every half bar.\n\nWe do admit that this simplification can decrease the chord color and reduce the intensity of tension/release patterns, and can sometimes convert a vibrant, subtle progression into a monotonous one (e.g., because both CMaj7 and C7 are mapped to C chord). We plan to make full use of the original chord vocabulary in future works.\n\nHaving pre-defined train and test splits helps to facilitate the use of HTTPD3 for evaluating new models of melody harmonization via the standardization of training procedure. As HTTPD3 includes paired melody and chord sequences, it can also be used to evaluate models for chord-conditioned melody generation as well. With these use cases in mind, we split the dataset so that the **training set** contains 80% of the pieces, and the **test set** contains 10% of the pieces. There are in total 923 lead sheet samples in the test set. The remaining 10% is reserved for future use. When splitting, we imposed the additional requirement that lead sheet samples from the same song are in the same subset.\n\n## 4 Proposed Objective Metrics\n\nTo our knowledge, there are at present no standardized, objective evaluation metrics for the melody harmonization task. The only objective metric adopted by (Lim et al., 2017), in evaluating the models they built is a categorical cross entropy-based chord prediction error, representing the discrepancy between the ground truth chords \\(Y_{*}\\) and predicted chords \\(\\hat{Y}_{*}=f(X_{*})\\). The chord prediction error is calculated for each half bar individually and then got averaged, not considering the chord sequence as a whole. In addition, it does not directly measure how the generated chord sequence fits with the given melody. What's more, when calculating the chord prediction error, the underlying assumption is that the \"ground truth\" chord sequence \\(Y_{*}\\) is the _only_ feasible one to harmonize the given melody \\(X_{*}\\). This is not true in general.\n\nFor the comparative study, we introduce here a set of six objective metrics defined below. These metrics are split into two categories, namely three chord progression metrics and three chord/melody harmonicity metrics. Please note that we do not evaluate the melody itself, as the melody is provided by the ground truth data.\n\n_Chord progression metrics_ evaluate each chord sequence as a whole, independent from the melody, and relate to the distribution of chord labels in a sequence.\n\n* **Chord histogram entropy** (CHE): Given a chord sequence, we create a histogram of chord occurrences with \\(|\\mathcal{C}|\\) bins. Then, we normalize the counts to sum to 1, and calculate its entropy: \\[H=-\\sum_{i=1}^{|\\mathcal{C}|}p_{i}\\log p_{i}\\,,\\] (10) where \\(p_{i}\\) is the relative probability of the \\(i\\)-th bin. The entropy is greatest when the histogram follows a uniform distribution, and lowest when the chord sequence uses only one chord throughout.\n* **Chord coverage** (CC): The number of chord labels with non-zero counts in the chord histogram in a chord sequence.\n* **Chord tonal distance** (CTD): The _tonal distance_ proposed by (Harte et al., 2006) is a canonical way to measure the closeness of two chords. It is calculated by firstly calculating the PCP features of two chords, projecting the PCP features to a derived 6-D tonal space, and finally calculating the Euclidean distance between the two 6-D feature vectors. CTD is the average value of the tonal distance computed between every pair of adjacent chords in a given chord sequence. The CTD is highest when there are abrupt changes in the chord progression (e.g., from C chord to B chord).\n\n_Chord/melody harmonicity metrics_, on the other hand, aims to evaluate the degree to which a generated chord sequence successfully harmonizes a given melody sequence.\n\n* **Chord tone to non-chord tone ratio** (CTnCTR): In reference to the chord sequence, we count the number of _chord tones_, and _non-chord tones_ in the melody sequence. Chord tones are defined as melody notes whose pitch class are part of the current chord (i.e., one of the three pitch classes that make up a triad) for the corresponding half bar. All the other melody notes are viewed as non-chord tones. One way to measure the harmonicity is to simply computing the ratio of the number of the chord tones (\\(n_{c}\\)) to the number of the non-chord tones (\\(n_{n}\\)). However, we find it useful to further take into account the number of a subset of non-chord tones (\\(n_{p}\\)) that are two semitones within the notes which are right after them, where subscript \\(p\\) denotes a \"proper\" non-chord tone. We define CTnCTR as \\[\\frac{n_{c}+n_{p}}{n_{c}+n_{n}}.\\] (11) CTnCTR equals one when there are no non-chord tones at all, or when \\(n_{p}=n_{n}\\).\n* **Pitch consonance score** (PCS): For each melody note, we calculate a _consonance score_ with each of the three notes of its corresponding chord label. The consonance scores are computed based on the musical interval between the pitch of the melody notes and the chord notes, assuming that the pitch of the melody notes is always higher. This is always the case in our implementation, because we always place the chord notes lower than the melody notes. The consonance score is set to 1 for consonance intervals including unison, major/minor 3rd, perfect 5th, major/minor 6th, set to 0 for a perfect 4th, and set to -1 for other intervals, which are considered dissonant. PCS for a pair of melody and chord sequences is computed by averaging these consonance scores across a 16th-note windows, excluding rest periods.\n* **Melody-chord tonal distance** (MCTD): Extending the idea of tonal distance, we represent a melody note by a PCP feature vector (which would be a one-hotvector) and compare it against the PCP of a chord label in the 6-D tonal space (Harte et al., 2006) to calculate the closeness between a melody note and a chord label. MCTD is the average of the tonal distance between every melody note and corresponding the chord label calculated across a melody sequence, with each distance weighted by the duration of the corresponding melody note.\n\n## 5 Comparative Study\n\nWe train all the five models described in Section 2 using the training split of HTPD3 and then apply them to the test split of HTPD3 to get the predicted chord sequences for each melody sequence. Examples of the harmonization result of the evaluated models can be found in Figures 3 and 4.\n\nWe note that, since one cannot judge the full potential of each algorithm only from our simplified setting of melody harmonization, we do not intend to find what method is the best in general. We rather attempt a challenge to compare different harmonization method which have not been directly compared because of the different context that each approach assumes.\n\nIn what follows, we use the harmonization result for a random subset of the test set comprising 100 pieces in a user study for subjective evaluation. The result of this subjective evaluation is presented in Section 5.1. Then, in Section 5.2, we report the results of an objective evaluation wherein we compute the mean values of the chord/melody harmonicity and chord progression metrics presented in Section 4 for the harmonization results for each test set piece.\n\nFigure 3: A harmonization example (in major key) from The Beatles: _Hey Jude_. We can see that, while the non-deep learning models change the harmonization in different phrases, the MTharmonizer generates a V-I progression nicely to close the phrase.\n\n### Subjective Evaluation\n\nWe conducted an online survey where we invited human subjects to listen to and assess the harmonization results of different models. The subjects evaluated the harmonizations in terms of the following criteria:\n\n* **Harmonicity**: The extent to which a chord progression successfully or pleasantly harmonizes a given melody. This is designed to correspond to what the melody/chord harmonicity metrics described in Section 4 aim to measure.\n* **Interestingness**: The extent to which a chord progression sounds exciting, unexpected and/or generates \"positive\" stimulation. This criterion corresponds to the chord-related metrics described in Section 4. Please note that we use a less technical term \"interestingness\" here since we intend to solicit feedback from people either with or without musical backgrounds.\n* The **Overall** quality of the given harmonization.\n\nGiven a melody sequence, we have in total six candidate chord sequences to accompany it: those generated by the five models presented in Section 2, and the _human-composed_, ground-truth progression retrieved directly from the test set. We intend to compare the results of the automatically generated progression with the original human-composed progression. Yet, given the time and cognitive load required, it was not possible to ask each subject to evaluate the results of every model for every piece of music in the test set (there are \\(6\\times 923=5,538\\) sequences in total). We describe below how our user study is designed to make the evaluation feasible.\n\nFigure 4: A harmonization example (in minor key) from ABBA: _Gimme Gimme Gimme A Man After Midnight_. Similar to the example shown in Figure 3, the result of the MTHarmonizer appears to be more diverse and functionally correct. We also see that the result of GA is quite \u201cinteresting\u201d\u2014e.g., with non-diatonic chord D flat Major and close the music phrase with Picardy third (i.e., a major chord of the tonic at the end of a chord sequence that is in a minor key). We also see that the non-deep learning methods seem to be weaker in handling the tonality of music.\n\n#### 5.1.1 Design of the User Study\n\nFirst, we randomly select 100 melodies from the test set of HTPD3. For each human subject, we randomly select three melody sequences from this pool, and present to the subject the harmonization results of two randomly selected models for each melody sequence. For each of the three melodies, the subject listens to the melody without accompaniment first, and then the sequence with two different harmonizations. Thus, the subject has to listen to nine music pieces in total: three melody sequences and the six harmonized ones. As we have six methods for melody harmonization (including the original human-composed harmonization), we select methods for each set of music such that each method is presented once and only once to each subject. The subjects are not aware of which harmonization is generated by which method, but are informed that at least one of the harmonized sequence is human-composed.\n\nIn each set, the subject has to listen to the two harmonized sequences and decide which version is better according to the three criteria mentioned earlier. This _ranking_ task is mandatory. In addition, the subject can choose to further grade the harmonized sequences in a five-point Likert scale with respect to the criteria mentioned earlier. Here, we break \"harmonicity\" into the following two criteria in order to get more feedback from subjects:\n\n* **Coherence**: the coherence between the melody and the chord progression in terms of harmonicity and phrasing.\n* **Chord Progression**: how coherent, pleasant, or reasonable the chord progression is on its own, independent of the melody.\n\nThis optional _rating_ task thus has four criteria in total.\n\nThe user study opens to an \"instructions\" page, that informs the subjects that we consider only root-positioned triad chords in the survey. Moreover, they are informed that there is no \"ground truth\" in melody harmonization--the task is by nature subjective. After collecting a small amount of relevant personal information from the subjects, we present them with a random audio sample and encourage them to put on their headsets and adjust the volume to a comfortable level. After that, they are prompted to begin evaluating the three sets (i.e., one set for each melody sequence), one-by-one on consecutive pages.\n\nWe spread the online survey over the Internet openly, without restriction, to solicit voluntary, non-paid participation. The webpage of the survey can be found at [https://musicai.citi.sinica.edu.tw/survey_mel_harm/](https://musicai.citi.sinica.edu.tw/survey_mel_harm/).\n\n#### 5.1.2 User Study Results\n\nIn total, 202 participants from 16 countries took part in the survey. We had more male participants than female (ratio of 1.82:1), and the average age of participants was 30.8 years old. 122 participants indicated that they have music background, and 69 of them are familiar with or expertise in the harmonic theory. The participants took on average 14.2 minutes to complete the survey.\n\nWe performed the following two data cleaning steps: First, we discarded both the ranking and rating results from participants who spent less than 3 minutes to complete the survey, which is considered too short. Second, we disregarded rating results when the relative ordering of the methods contradicted that from the ranking results. As a result, 9.1% and 21% of the ranking and rating records were removed, respectively.\n\nWe first discuss the results of the pairwise ranking task, which is shown in Figure 5. The following observations are made:Figure 5: \u201cWin probabilities\u201d of different model pairs. Each entry represents the probability that the model in that column scores higher than the model in that row.\n\n* The human-composed progressions have the highest \"win probabilities\" on average in all the three ranking criteria. It performs particularly well in _Harmonicity_.\n* In general, the deep learning methods have higher probabilities to win over the non-deep learning methods in _Harmonicity_ and _Overall_.\n* For _Interestingness_, GA performs the best among the five automatic methods, which we suspect stems from its entropy term (Eq. (6)).\n* Among the two deep learning methods, the MTHarmonizer consistently outperforms the BiLSTM in all ranking criteria, especially for _Interestingness_. We (subjectively) observe that MTHarmonizer indeed generates more diverse chord progressions compared to the vanilla BiLSTM, perhaps due to the consideration of functions.\n\nThe results of the rating task shown in Figure 6, on the other hand, lead to the following observations:\n\n* Congruent with the results of the ranking task, the MTHarmonzer model achieves the second best performance here, only losing out to the original human-composed chord progressions. The MTHarmonzer consistently outperforms the other four automatic methods in all the four metrics. With a paired t-test, we find that there is significant performance difference between the MTHarmonzer progressions and the original human-composed progressions in terms of _Coherence_ and _Chord Progression_ (p-value\\(<\\)0.005), but no significant difference in terms of _Interestingness_ and _Overall_.\n* Among the four metrics, the original human-composed progressions score higher in _Coherence_ (3.81) and _Overall_ (3.78), and the lowest in _Interestingness_ (3.43). This suggests that the way we simplify the data (e.g., using only root-positioned triad chords) may have limited the perceptual qualities of the music, in particular its diversity.\n* Generally speaking, the results in _Chord Progression_ (i.e., the coherence of the chord progression on its own) seems to correlate better with the results in _Coherence_ (i.e., the coherence between the melody and chord sequences) than the _Interestingness_ of the chord progression. This suggests that a chord progression rated as being interesting may not sound coherent.\n* Although the GA performs worse than the MTHarmonizer on all the four metrics, it actually performs fairly well in _Interestingness_ (3.23), as we have observed from the ranking result. A paired t-test showed no significant performance difference between the GA generated progressions and original human-composed progressions in _Interestingness_. A hybrid model that combines GA and deep learning may be a promising direction for future research.\n\nFrom the rating and ranking tasks, we see that, in terms of harmonicity, automatic\n\nFigure 6: The mean rating scores in subjective evaluation, along with the standard deviation (the error bars).\n\nmethods still fall behind the human composition. However, the results of the two deep learning based methods are closer to that of the human-composed ones.\n\n### Objective Evaluation\n\nThe results are displayed in Table 1. We discuss the result of the melody/chord harmonicity metrics first. We can see that the results for the two deep learning methods are in general closer to the results for the original human-composed progressions than those of the three non-deep learning methods for all three harmonicity metrics, most significantly on the latter two. The template matching-based and HMM-based methods scores high in PCS and low in MCTD, indicating that the harmonization these two methods generate may be too conservative. In contrast, the GA scores low in PCS and high in MCTD, indicating overly low harmonicity. These results are consistent with the subjective evaluation, suggesting that these metrics can perhaps reflect human perception of the harmonicity between melody and chords.\n\nFrom the result of the chord progression metrics, we also see from CHE and CC that the progressions generated by the template matching-based and HMM-based methods seem to lack diversity. In contrast, the output of GA features high diversity.\n\nAs the GA based method was rated lower than the template matching and HMM methods in terms of the _Overall_ criterion in our subjective evaluation, it seems that the subjects care more about the harmonicity than the diversity of chord progressions.\n\nComparing the two deep learning methods, we see that the MTHarmonizer uses more non-chord tones (smaller CTnCTR) and uses a greater number of unique chords\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \\hline \\hline\n**Melody/chord harmonicity metrics** & CTnCTR & PCS & MCTD \\\\ \\hline Human-composed & 0.74 & 1.42 & 1.03 \\\\ Template matching & 0.91 & 1.97 & 0.83 \\\\ HMM (adapted from (Lim et al., 2017)) & 0.89 & 1.93 & 0.85 \\\\ GA-based (adapted from (Kitahara et al., 2018)) & **0.74** & 0.43 & 1.31 \\\\ BiLSTM (adapted from (Lim et al., 2017)) & 0.87 & 1.84 & 0.91 \\\\ MTHarmonizer (proposed here) & 0.82 & **1.77** & **0.94** \\\\ \\hline\n**Chord progression metrics** & CHE & CC & CTD \\\\ \\hline Human-composed & 1.28 & 2.62 & 0.88 \\\\ Template matching & 1.01 & 1.70 & 0.65 \\\\ HMM (adapted from (Lim et al., 2017)) & 0.88 & 1.89 & 0.56 \\\\ GA-based (adapted from (Kitahara et al., 2018)) & 1.58 & **2.47** & **0.96** \\\\ BiLSTM (adapted from (Lim et al., 2017)) & 1.07 & 2.07 & 0.71 \\\\ MTHarmonizer (proposed here) & **1.29** & 2.31 & 1.02 \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: Objective evaluation scores for different melody harmonization models. The closer the values to that of the human-composed samples, the better the model is in modeling the training data. The bold values indicate the closet value to that of the human-composed samples per metric. And, 1) higher values in CTnCTR and PCS and lower values in MCTD may suggest that the melody/chord harmonicity is high; 2) higher values in CHE and CC and lower values in CTD may suggest that the diversity (which can be related to the interestingness) of the chord progression is high. See Section 4 for the definitions of the metrics.\n\n(larger CC) than the BiLSTM model. The CHE of the MTHarmonizer is very close to that of the original human-composed progressions.\n\nIn general, the results of the objective evaluation appear consistent with those of the subjective evaluation. It is difficult to quantify which metrics are better for what purposes, and how useful and accurate these metrics are overall. Therefore, our suggestion is to use them mainly to gain practical insights into the results of automatic melody harmonization models, rather than to judge their quality. As pointed out by (Dong et al., 2018), objective metrics can be used to track the performance of models during development, before committing to running the user study. Yet, human evaluations are still needed to evaluate the quality of the generated music.\n\nFinally, although we have argued earlier that there is no ground truth in melody harmonization and that it is not adequate to rely solely on chord prediction error to evaluate the models, we find that the MTHarmonizer also achieves the lowest chord prediction error (i.e., a 48-class classification problem) and chord function prediction error (a 3-class classification problem). On the test set, the chord prediction accuracy for the five models (template matching, HMM, GA, BiLSTM, and MTHarmonizer) is 29%, 31%, 20%, 35%, and 38%, respectively, while the accuracy for a random guess baseline is only 2%. And, the chord function prediction accuracy is 62%, 61%, 55%, 65%, 69%, respectively, while the accuracy for a random guess baseline is 51%.\n\n## 6 Discussions\n\nWe admit that the comparative study presented above has some limitations. First, because of the various preprocessing steps taken for data cleaning and for making the melody harmonization task manageable (cf. Section 3), the \"human-composed\" harmonizations are actually simplified versions of those found on TheoryTab. We considered triad chords only, and we did not consider performance-level attributes such as velocity and rhythmic pattern of chords. This limits the perceptual quality of the human-composed chord progression, and therefore also limits the results that can be achieved by automatic methods. The reduction from extended chords to triads reduces the \"color\" of the chords and creates many innacurate chord repetitions in the dataset (e.g., both the alternated CMaj7 and C7 will be reduced to C triad chord). We believe it is important to properly inform the human subjects of such limitations as we did in the instruction phase of our user study. We plan to compile other datasets from HLSD to extend the comparative study in the future.\n\nSecond, in our user study we asked human subjects to rank and rate the results of two randomly chosen methods in each of the three presented sets. After analyzing the results, we found that the subject's ratings are in fact _relative_. For example, the MTHarmonizer's average score in _Overall_ is 3.04 when presented alongside the human-composed progressions, and 3.57 when confronted with the genetic algorithm-based model. We made sure in our user study that all the methods are equally likely to be presented together with every other method, so the average rating scores presented in Figure 6 do not favor a particular method. Still, caution is needed when interpreting the rating scores. Humans may not have a clear idea of how to consistently assign a score to a harmonization. While it is certainly easier to objectively compare multiple methods with the provided rating scores, we still recommended asking human subjects to make pairwise rankings in order to make the result more reliable.\n\nThird, as the aim of this paper is to sample representative models from the literature, the current setting cannot decouple the effects of the model architectures (e.g.,HMMs, GAs and BiLSTMs) and the music knowledge induced into the model (e.g., the concept of functional harmonic in MTHarmonizer). Moreover, for similar reasons, the models we implemented in this paper do not include extensions that might lead to better performance. For example, we could further improve the HMM model by using trigrams or extending the hidden layers as discussed in the literature (Paiement et al., 2006; Temperley, 2009; Tsushima et al., 2017). It may also be possible to incorporate some of the proposed objective metrics (such as the chord tone to non-chord tone ratio) as additional loss terms. The aim of this paper is to observe how different categories of models characterize the harmonization results rather than to explore the full potentials of each presented model.\n\nReviewing the properties of harmonization algorithms which imitate styles in a dataset as in our research still holds its importance, although recent music generation research is shifting towards measuring how systems can generate content that extrapolates meaningfully from what the model have learned (Zacharakis, Kaliakatsospapakostas, Tsougras, & Cambouropoulos, 2018). Extrapolation could be based on the model which also achieves interpolation or maintaining particular styles among data points. We believe we can further discuss extrapolation based on the understanding of how methods imitate data.\n\n## 7 Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we have presented a comparative study implementing and evaluating a number of canonical methods and one new method for melody harmonization, including deep learning and non-deep learning based approaches. The evaluation has been done using a lead sheet dataset we newly collected for training and evaluating melody harmonization. In addition to conducting a subjective evaluation, we employed in total six objective metrics with which to evaluate a chord progression given a melody. Our evaluation shows that deep learning models indeed perform better than non-deep learning ones in a variety of aspects, including harmonicity and interestingness. Moreover, a deep learning model that takes the function of chords into account reaches the best result among the evaluated models.\n\nFuture work can be directed toward at least the following three directions. First, it is important to extend the chord vocabulary to include more complicated chords. Second, as self-attention based neural sequence models such as the Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) have been shown powerful alternatives to RNNs for various automatic music generation tasks (Y.-H. Chen, Huang, Hsiao, & Yang, 2020; Donahue, Mao, Li, Cottrell, & McAuley, 2019; Y.-S. Huang & Yang, 2020; Ren et al., 2020), it might be interesting to investigate Transformer-based models for melody harmonization. Finally, other than the melody harmonization task (i.e., generating chords given a melody) addressed in the paper, it would also be interesting to study chord-conditioned melody generation (i.e., generating a melody given chords) (Genchel, Pati, & Lerch, 2019; Trieu & Keller, 2018; Yang, Chou, & Yang, 2017), or simultaneously generating both melody and harmony from scratch (Jiang, Xia, Carlton, Anderson, & Miyakawa, 2020; Liu & Yang, 2018; Wu & Yang, 2020).\n\n## References\n\n* Allan & Williams (2005) Allan, M., & Williams, C.

We hereby \npresent the NUS Sung and Spoken Lyrics Corpus (NUS-48E \ncorpus) as the first step toward a large, phonetically annotated \ncorpus for singing voice research. The corpus is a 169-min \ncollection of audio recordings of the sung and spoken lyrics of 48 \n(20 unique) English songs by 12 subjects and a complete set of \ntranscriptions and duration annotations at the phone level for all \nrecordings of sung lyrics, comprising 25,474 phone instances.  \nUsing the NUS-48E corpus, we conducted a preliminary, \nquantitative study on the comparison between singing voice and \nspeech.  The study includes duration analyses of the sung and \nspoken lyrics, with a primary focus on the behavior of \nconsonants, and experiments aiming to gauge how acoustic \nrepresentations of spoken and sung phonemes differ, as well as \nhow duration and pitch variations may affect the Mel Frequency \nCepstral Coefficients (MFCC) features.  \nI. \nINTRODUCTION \nIn audio signal analysis, it is important to understand the \ncharacteristics of singing voice and their relation to speech.  A \nwide range of research problems, such as singing and speech \ndiscrimination and singing voice recognition, evaluation, and \nsynthesis, \nstand \nto \nbenefit \nfrom \na \nmore \nprecise \ncharacterization of the singing voice.  Better solutions to these \nresearch problems could then lead to technological \nadvancements in numerous application scenarios, from music \ninformation retrieval and music edutainment to language \nlearning [1] and speech therapy [2]. \nGiven the similarity between singing and speech, many \nresearchers classify the former as a type of the latter and try to \nutilize the well-established automatic speech recognition \n(ASR) framework to handle the singing voice [3][4][5].  Due \nto the lack of phonetically annotated singing datasets, models \nhave been trained on speech corpora and then adapted to the \nsinging voice.  This approach, however, is intrinsically \nlimited because the differences between singing and speech \nsignals are not captured.  Thus, a quantitative comparison of \nsinging voice and speech could potentially improve the \ncapability and robustness of current ASR systems in handling \nsinging voice.   \nDespite long-standing efforts to characterize various \naspects of singing voice and their relations to speech [7][8], \nthe lack of a suitable dataset has precluded any systematic \nquantitative study.  Given that most existing models are \nstatistics-based, an ideal dataset should not only have a large \nsize but also exhibit sufficient diversity within the data. To \nexplore the quantitative differences of singing and speech at \nthe phone level, the research community needs a corpus of \nphonetically annotated recordings of sung and spoken lyrics \nby a diverse group of subjects. \nIn this paper, we introduce the NUS Sung and Spoken \nLyrics Corpus (NUS-48E corpus for short), 48 English songs \nthe lyrics of which are sung and read out by 12 subjects \nrepresenting a variety of voice types and accents. There are 20 \nunique songs, each of which covered by at least one male and \none female subject. The total length of audio recordings is \n115 min for the singing data and 54 min for the speech data. \nAll singing recordings have been phonetically transcribed \nwith duration boundaries, and the total number of annotated \nphones is 25,474. The corpus marks the first step toward a \nlarge, phonetically annotated dataset for singing voice \nresearch. \nUsing the new corpus, we conducted a preliminary study on \nthe quantitative comparison between sung and spoken lyrics.  \nUnlike in speech, the durations of syllables and phonemes in \nsinging are constrained by the music score. They have much \nlarger variations and often undergo stretching.  While vowel \nstretching is largely dependent on the tempo, rhythm, and \narticulation specified in the score, consonant stretching is \nmuch less well understood.  We thus conducted duration \nanalyses of the singing and speech data, primarily focusing on \nconsonants.  We also hope to better understand how one can \nborrow from and improve upon the state-of-the-art speech \nprocessing techniques to handle singing data.  We thus carried \nout experiments to quantify how the acoustic representations \nof spoken and sung phonemes differ, as well as how \nvariations in duration and pitch may affect the Mel Frequency \nCepstral Coefficients (MFCC) features.  The results of both \nthe duration and spectral analyses are hereby presented and \ndiscussed. \nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. \nSection II provides an overview of existing datasets and \nrelated works on the differences between singing and speech.  \nSection III describes the collection, annotation, and \ncomposition of the NUS-48E corpus.  Section IV and V \npresent the results of the duration analyses and spectral \ncomparisons, respectively.  Finally, Section VI and VII \nconclude this paper and suggest future work. \nII. \nRELATED WORK \n\fA. \nSinging Voice Dataset \nSinging datasets of various sizes and annotated contents are \navailable for research purposes.  To the best of our knowledge, \nhowever, none has duration annotations at the phoneme level.  \nMesaros and Virtanen conducted automatic recognition of \nsung lyrics using 49 singing clips, 19 of which are from male \nsingers and 30 from female singers [4].  Each clip is 20-30 \nseconds long, and the complete dataset amounts to \napproximately 30 minutes.  Although a total of 4770 phoneme \ninstances are present, the lyrics of each singing clip are \nmanually transcribed only at the word level, without any \nduration boundaries.  \nThe MIR-1K dataset [6] is a larger dataset consisting of \n1000 clips from 110 unique Chinese songs as sung by 19 \namateur singers, 8 of whom female.  The total length of the \nsinging clips is 133 minutes.  Since this dataset is intended for \nsinging voice separation, annotations consist of pitch, lyrics, \nunvoiced frame types, and vocal/non-vocal segmentation, but \ndo not contain segmentation on the word level or below. \nAIST Humming Database (AIST-HDB) [9] is a large \ndatabase for singing and humming research.  The database \ncontains a total of 125.9 hours of humming/singing/reading \nmaterials, recorded from 100 subjects. Each subject produced \n100 excerpts of 50 songs chosen from the RWC Music \nDatabase (RWC-MDB) [16].  While the lyrics of the songs \nare known, neither the AIST-HDB nor the RWC-MDB \nprovides any phoneme or word boundary annotation. \nB. \nDifferences of Singing and Speech \nObservations on differences of singing and speech have \nbeen reported and studied [7][8].  The three main differences \nlie in phoneme duration, pitch, and power.  Constrained by \nthe music score and performance conventions, the singing \nvoice stretches phonemes, stabilizes pitches, and roams within \na wider pitch range.  The power changes with pitch in singing \nbut not in speech. \nOhishi et al. studied the human capability in discriminating \nsinging and speaking voices [10].  They reported that human \nsubjects could distinguish singing and speaking with 70.0% \naccuracy for 200-ms signals and 99.7% for one-second \nsignals. The results suggest that both temporal characteristics \nand short-term spectral features contribute to perceptual \njudgment. The same research group also investigated shortterm MFCC features and long-term contour of the \nfundamental frequency (F0) in order to improve machine \nperform on singing-speaking discrimination [8].  F0 contour \nworks better for signals longer than one second, while MFCC \nperforms better on shorter signals.  The combination of the \nshort-term and long-term features achieved more than 90% \naccuracy for two-second signals.  \nSince singing and speech are similar from various aspects, \nfinding the right set of features to discriminate the two is \ncrucial.  A set of features derived from harmonic coefficient \nand its 4Hz modulation values are proposed in [11]. While in \n[12], a feature selection solution among 276 features is \nintroduced. \nC. \nConversion between Singing and Speech \nThe conversion between speaking and singing has also \nattracted research interest.  A system for speech-to-singing \nsynthesis is described in [13]. By modifying the F0, phoneme \nduration, and spectral characteristics, the system can \nsynthesize \na \nsinging \nvoice \nwith \nnaturalness \nalmost \ncomparable to a real singing voice using a speaking voice and \nthe corresponding text as input.  A similar system is \ndeveloped in [14] to convert spoken vowels into singing \nvowels.  On the other hand, the SpeakBySinging [15] system \nconverts a singing voice into a speaking voice while retaining \nthe timbre of the singing voice.  \nIII. THE NUS SUNG AND SPOKEN LYRICS CORPUS \nA. \nAudio Data Collection \nSong Selection. We selected twenty songs in English as the \nbasis of our corpus (see Table I).  They include well-known \ntraditional songs and popular songs that have been regional \nand international hits, as well as several songs that may be \nless familiar but are chosen for their phonemic richness and \nease of learning.  In addition, lyrics of some songs, such as \nJingle Bells and Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, are expanded to \ninclude verses other than the most familiar ones to further \nenhance the phonemic richness of the corpus, while overly \nrepetitive lines or instances of scat singing, such as those \nfound in Far Away from Home and Lemon Tree, are excised \nto better preserve phonemic balance.  The list of songs and \ntheir selected lyrics are posted on our study website1. \nSubject Profile. We recruited 21 subjects, 9 males and 12 \nfemales, from the National University of Singapore (NUS) \nChoir and the amateur vocal community at NUS.  All subjects \nare enrolled students or staff of the university.  They are 21 to \n27 years of age and come with a wide range of musical \nexposure, from no formal musical training to more than 10 \nyears of vocal ensemble experience and vocal training.  All \nfour major voice types (soprano, alto, tenor, and bass) are \nrepresented, as well as a spectrum of English accents, from \nNorth American to the various accents commonly found in \nSingapore.  Local accents tend to be less apparent in singing \nthan in speaking, a phenomenon that becomes more marked \nas the subject\u2019s vocal experience increases.  Subjects are all \nproficient speakers of English, if not native speakers.  \nCollection Procedure. Subjects visited the study website \nto familiarize with the lyrics of all twenty songs before \ncoming to our sound-proof recording studio (STC 50+) for \ndata collection.  An Audio-Technica 4050 microphone with \npop filter was used for the recording.  Audio data were \ncollected at 16-bit and 44.1kHz using Pro Tools 9, which also \ngenerated a metronome with downbeat accent to set the tempi \nand to serve as a guide for singing.  The metronome was fed \nto the subject via the headphone.  The selected lyrics for all \nsongs were printed and placed on a music stand by the \n                                                             \n1 http://singingevaluation.wordpress.com/2012/11/22/songs-to-pick/ \n\fmicrophone for the subject\u2019s reference.  Except metronome \nbeats heard through the headphone, no other accompaniment \nwas provided, and subjects were recorded a cappella. \nFor each song, the selected lyrics were sung first.  While \nthe tempo was set, the subject could choose a comfortable key \nand were free to make small alterations to rhythm and pitch.  \nThen, the subject\u2019s reading of the lyrics was recorded on a \nseparate track.  When a track with all the lyrics clearly sung \nor spoken was obtained, the subject proceeded to the next \nsong.  A few pronunciation errors were allowed as long as the \nutterance remained clear.  Except the occasional rustles of the \nlyric printouts, miscellaneous noise was avoided or excised \nfrom the recording as much as possible. \nFor each subject, an average of 65 minutes of audio data \nwas thus collected in 20 singing (~45min) and 20 reading \ntracks (~20min).  Each track was then bounced from Pro \nTools as a wav file for subsequent storage, annotation, and \naudio analyses.  At the end of the recording session, we \nreimbursed each subject with a S$50 gift voucher for the \nuniversity co-op store. \nB. \nData Annotation \nWe adopted the 39-phoneme set used by the CMU \nDictionary (see Table II) for phonetic annotation [17].  Three \nannotators used Audacity to create a label track for each audio \nfile, and labeled phones and their timestamps are exported as \na text file.  Phones were labeled not according to their \ndictionary pronunciation in American English but as they had \nbeen uttered.  This was done to better capture the effect of \nsinging as well as the singer\u2019s accent on the standard \npronunciation.  We also included two extra labels, sil and sp, \nto mark the lengths of silence or inhalation between words \n(and, occasionally, between phones mid-word) and all \nduration-less word boundaries, respectively (see Fig. 1).  \nLabels of one annotator were checked by another to ensure \ninter-rater consistency. \nC. \nCorpus Composition \nDue to the time-consuming nature of phonetic transcription \nand the limitations on manpower, for the first version of the \ncorpus we only manually annotated the singing data of 12 \nsubjects.  They include 6 males and 6 females and represent \nall voice types and accent types (see Table III).  For each \nsubject, we selected 4 songs to annotate.  To ensure that all 20 \nsongs were annotated at least once for both genders and that \nthe number of annotated phones for each subject remained \nroughly equal, we ranked the songs by the number of phones \nestimated using the CMU Dictionary and assigned them \naccordingly (see Table I).  At this stage, each subject has \n \nTABLE   I \nSONGS IN THE NUS CORPUS \n \nSong Name \nArtist / Origin (Year) \nTempo \n(bpm) \nAudio Length \nEstimate (s) \nPhone Count \nEstimate \nFemale \nSubjecta \nMale \nSubjecta \nEdelweiss \nThe Sound of Music (1959) \nMed (96) \n65 \n140 \n03 \n11 \nDo Re Mi \nThe Sound of Music (1959) \nFast (120) \n67 \n280 \n05 \n08 \nJingle Bells \nPopular Christmas Carol \nFast (120) \n85 \n630 \n05 \n08 \nSilent Night \nPopular Christmas Carol \nSlow (80) \n165 \n340 \n01 \n09 \nWonderful Tonight \nEric Clapton (1976) \nSlow (80) \n180  \n450 \n02 & 06 \n07 & 10 \nMoon River \nBreakfast at Tiffany's (1961) \nSlow (88) \n160 \n380 \n05 \n08 \nRhythm of the Rain \nThe Cascades (1962) \nMed (116) \n85 \n460 \n04 \n12 \nI Have a Dream \nABBA (1979) \nMed (112) \n135 \n390 \n06 \n10 \nLove Me Tender \nElvis Presley (1956) \nSlow (72) \n140 \n310 \n03 \n11 \nTwinkle Twinkle Little Star \nPopular Children's Song \nFast (150) \n115 \n640 \n01 \n09 \nYou Are My Sunshine \nJimmy Davis (1940) \nSlow (84) \n167 \n620 \n02 & 06 \n07 & 10 \nA Little Love \nJoey Yung (2004) \nSlow (84) \n53 \n250 \n01 \n09 \nProud of You \nJoey Yung (2003) \nSlow (84) \n140 \n680 \n03 \n11 \nLemon Tree \nFool's Garden (1995) \nFast (150) \n160 \n900 \n05 \n08 \nCan You Feel the Love Tonight \nElton John (1994) \nSlow (68) \n175 \n540 \n04 & 06 \n10 & 12 \nFar Away from Home \nGroove Coverage (2002) \nMed (112) \n140 \n680 \n04 \n12 \nSeasons in the Sun \nTerry Jacks (1974); Westlife (1999) \nMed (100) \n175 \n920 \n01 \n09 \nThe Show \nLenka (2008) \nFast (132) \n200 \n980 \n03 \n11 \nThe Rose \nBette Midler (1979) \nSlow (68) \n175 \n450 \n02 \n07 \nRight Here Waiting \nRichard Marx (1989) \nSlow (88) \n160 \n550 \n02 & 04 \n07 & 12 \na Number in these columns are code identifications of subject singers. See Table III \n\faround 2100 phones annotated, and the corpus contains a total \nof 25,474 phone instances.  \nAnnotation for spoken lyrics is generated by aligning the \nmanually-labeled phone strings of the sung lyrics to the \nspoken lyrics using conventional Gaussian Mixture Model \n(GMM) \u2013 Hidden Markov Model (HMM) system trained on \nthe Wall Street Journal (WSJ0) corpus (see Sec. 5 for details).  \nWhile numerous discrepancies might exist between the actual \nsung and spoken versions, arising from the articulatory \npeculiarities of subjects and the differing methods of \nalignment, the annotated spoken lyrics allow us to make broad \nand preliminary observations about the extent of phonemic \nstretching between sung and spoken lyrics.  As part of our \nfuture work, we will expand our corpus to include manual \nannotations of the spoken lyrics. \nIV. DURATION ANALYSIS \nA. \nConsonants Stretching \nIn singing, vowels are stretched to maintain musical notes \nfor certain durations, and their durations are to a large extent \ndictated by the score.  While the stretching of vowels is much \nmore pronounced, consonants are nevertheless stretched at a \nnon-trivial level (see Fig. 2).  As the factors influencing \nconsonant duration are less apparent than those for vowels, \nwe will explore not only how much stretching takes place but \nalso what may affect the amount of stretching.  \n \nThe stretching ratio is computed as follows, \n \nsr = Tsinging / Tspeech ,                            (1) \n \nwhere sr is the stretching ratio and Tsinging and Tspeech the \ndurations of the phoneme in singing and the corresponding \nspeech, respectively.  The higher the sr value, the more the \nphoneme is stretched in singing. \nIn the speech-to-singing conversion system developed in \n[13], the authors use fixed ratios for different types of \nconsonants.  The ratios used are experimentally determined \nfrom observations of singing and speech signals.  Using the \nNUS-48E corpus, we analyzed the stretching ratio of \n \nFig. 2   Comparison on Duration Stretching  \nof Vowels and Consonants in singing \n \nFig. 1  SIL and SP labels denoting boundaries \nTABLE   II \nPHONEMES AND PHONEME CATEGORIES \n \nClass \nCMU Phonemes  \nVowels \nAA, AE, AH, AO, AW, AY, EH, ER, EY, \nIH, IY, OW, OY, UH, UW \nSemivowels \nW, Y \nStops \nB, D, G, K, P, T \nAffricates \nCH, JH \nFricatives \nDH, F, S, SH, TH, V, Z, ZH \nAspirates \nHH \nLiquids \nL, R \nNasals \nM, N, NG \n \nTABLE   III \nSUBJECTS IN THE NUS CORPUS \n \nCode \nGender \nVoice Type \nSung Accent \nSpoken Accent \n01 \nF \nSoprano \nNorth American \nNorth American \n02 \nF \nSoprano \nNorth American \nNorth American \n03 \nF \nSoprano \nNorth American \nMild Local \nSingaporean \n04 \nF \nAlto \nMild Malay \nMild Malay \n05 \nF \nAlto \nMalay \nMalay \n06 \nF \nAlto \nMild Malay \nMild Malay \n07 \nM \nTenor \nMild Local \nSingaporean \nMild Local \nSingaporean \n08 \nM \nTenor \nNorthern Chinese \nNorthern Chinese \n09 \nM \nBaritone \nNorth American \nNorth American \n10 \nM \nBaritone \nNorth American \nStandard \nSingaporean \n11 \nM \nBaritone \nNorth American \nNorth American \n12 \nM \nBass \nLocal Singaporean \nLocal Singaporean \n \n\fconsonants.  Given that the phoneme alignment on speech \ndata is automatically generated with a speech recognizer \nwhile the phoneme boundaries on singing data are manually \nannotated, the results remain preliminary observations. \nAs shown in Fig. 3, among the 7 types of consonants \ncompared, liquids, semivowels, and nasals exhibit larger \nstretching ratios (2.2371, 1.9852, and 1.7027, respectively.)  \nThis result conforms to the intuition that these types of \nsonorants could be sustained and articulated for a longer \nperiod of time than others types such as stops and affricates.  \nAnother interesting question is how the consonants are \nstretched in syllables of various lengths.  The length of the \nsyllables may have an effect on the length of consonants.  As \nshown in Fig. 4, when syllable length starts to grow, the \nstretching ratio of semivowels increases accordingly. After \nthe syllable length reaches around 1 second, however, the \nstretching ratio of semivowels tends to decrease. Not \nsurprisingly, since vowels are the dominant constituent of \nsyllables, the stretching ratio of vowels keeps growing when \nsyllables become longer.  \nObservations on other types of consonants are similar to \nthat discussed above for semivowels. \nB. \nSubject Variations on Consonants Stretching \nAs observations in the previous section only describe an \noverarching trend across all consonants for all subjects, it is \nimportant to check whether individual subjects follow such a \ntrend consistently.  We first investigated the differences with \nrespect to gender.  Fig. 5 shows the probability density \nfunctions (PDF) for the stretching ratios of both gender \ngroups.  The difference between them is negligible, \nsuggesting that consonant stretching ratio is genderindependent. Next, we compared individual subjects.  For \nexample, subjects 05 and 08 contributed the same 4 songs, Do \nRe Mi, Jingle Bells, Moon River, and Lemon Tree.  Subject 05 \nis a female with Malay accent and has had two years of choral \nexperience at the time of recording, while subject 06 is a male \nwith northern Chinese accent and had no vocal training \nwhatsoever.  As Fig. 6 shows, the distributions of the \nconsonant stretching ratios of the two subjects remain roughly \nthe same despite individual differences in accent and musical \nexposure. Therefore, the extent of consonant stretching may \nbe attributed more to the act of singing itself than any \ndiscrepancy in the vocal practice of the singers.  \nC. \nSyllabic Proportions of Consonants \nSyllabic proportions are calculated as quotients of the \nconsonant durations and the syllable durations.  A phone with \nlonger duration might not take up a higher proportion as it \nmay be part of a long syllable. \nFigure 7 shows the syllabic proportion for all consonant \ntypes and both gender groups.  Overall, semivowels have the \nhighest proportion while aspirates and stops have the lowest.  \nWith aspirates as the lone exception, the syllabic proportions \nof all consonant types are higher in males than in females.  \n \nFig. 4   Comparison on Duration Stretching Ratio across Different Length of \nSyllables for Vowels and Semivowels \n \n \nFig. 3  Average Stretching Ratios of Seven Types of Consonants \n\fFurther observation confirms that the absolute duration \nlengths of both consonants and syllables are larger in male \nsubjects.  This is an unexpected and interesting phenomenon \ngiven the observation made in the last subsection, namely that \nconsonant durations seem to be stretched to similar extents in \nsubjects of both genders.   \nThree factors could contribute to such a phenomenon.  First, \nmale and female subjects may have somewhat different \nduration distributions for consonants and vowels within the \nspoken syllables to begin with.  Second, the stretching of sung \nvowels could exhibit gender-related discrepancies.  Lastly, \nstructure of the same syllable in the lyrics could be different \nbetween speech and singing, especially for subjects who \nwould sing in a different accent.  A dropped consonant or a \ndiphthongized vowel could alter syllable makeup and affect \nsyllable length.  Once we have expanded our corpus to \ninclude phonetic annotations for the spoken lyrics, we plan to \nfurther our comparison study to examine these factors.  \nD. \nConsonant Position and its Effect on Proportion \n Within a syllable, consonants may appear at different \npositions.  For example, in the word love (/l/ /ah/ /v/), \nconsonant /l/ is located at the beginning of the word; while in \nsoul (/s/ /ow/ /l/), it is at the end. We are interested to see \nwhether this positioning has any effect on the syllabic \nproportion. We first defined four consonant positions: \n1. Starting: at the beginning of a word, e.g. /g/ in go \n2. Preceding: preceding a vowel, but not at the beginning \nof a word, e.g. /m/ in small \n3. Succeeding: succeeding a vowel, but not at the end of \na word, e.g. /l/ in angels \n4. Ending: at the end of a word, e.g. /t/ in at \nWe compared the syllabic proportions for the seven \nconsonant categories with respect to positioning. The results \nare shown in Fig. 8.  Semivowels and stops at the starting \nposition are much more prominent than those at the end, \nwhile the opposite is observed for affricates and nasals.  The \nsyllabic proportions of fricatives, aspirates and liquids are \nlargely similar between the starting and ending position.  \nFor all consonants, the proportion for preceding position is \nsignificantly lower than that of the starting one.  The \nphenomenon is mirrored for the succeeding and ending \npositions, in which the latter is much more prominent than the \nformer. \nV. \nSPECTRAL ANALYSIS \nAlthough we could build a conventional Gaussian Mixture \nModel (GMM) \u2013 Hidden Markov Model (HMM) system \nusing the NUS-48E corpus, the performance is expected to be \nlow mainly due to the following two factors: the limited \namount of speech data and the variation of accents among the \nsubjects. While few large, high-quality singing corpora are \navailable for academic research, there are numerous standard \nspeech corpora. We adopted the Wall Street Journal (WSJ0) \ncorpus, a large collection of read speech with texts drawn \nfrom a machine-readable corpus of Wall Street Journal news, \n \nFigure 7  Mean syllabic proportions for different types of consonants \n \nFigure 8  Proportion comparison of consonants in different positions \n \nFig. 5   Comparison on Probability Density Function of Consonants Duration \nStretching Ratio with Respect to Gender \n \nFig. 6   Comparison on Consonants Duration Stretching Ratio of Subject 05 \nand Subject 08 \n\fto train our speech GMM-HMM system, which is built to \nmaximize the likelihood of the training data using the Hidden \nMarkov Model Toolkit (HTK). The system adopts the CMU \nphoneme set used in the NUS-48E corpus and has a total of \n2419 tied triphone states to model the various phoneme \nrealizations in different acoustic contexts. Each state is \nmodeled by a GMM with 16 components. On the benchmark \n5k close vocabulary speech recognition task, our model has a \nword error rate (WER) of 5.51% when decoding with the \nbigram language model.  \nFor comparison purpose, we also built a simple monophone \nbased GMM-HMM system using the singing data of the \nNUS-48E corpus. Instead of the doing automatic alignment of \nthe training data, we fixed the phoneme boundary according \nto the human annotations during training. Similarly, this \nsinging GMM-HMM system also has 16 Gaussian for each \nstate.  \nBoth the speaking and singing waveform signals are \nprocessed with a 25ms time window and a shift of 10ms. \nTwelve dimensional MFCC features together with an energy \nterm are extracted from each time window. These 13 terms, \nalong with their first order and second order derivatives, make \nup the final, 39-dimensional feature vector.  \nA. \nPhoneme likelihood score comparison \nThe GMM-HMM system trained on the WSJ0 corpus \ncaptures the spectral characteristics of the speech signals, and \nwe used it to perform alignment on both the speech and \nsinging data in the NUS-48E corpus.  The alignment on \nsinging data was restricted with the manually labeled \nboundaries.  During both alignment tasks, the likelihood score \ngenerated by the GMM-HMM system were stored.  Since the \nsystem is trained on a speech corpus, it is expected to perform \nworse on singing data.  However, the difference between the \nlikelihood scores of singing and speech phonemes carries \nuseful information.  It can serve as an indirect measure of the \ndistance between the acoustic representation of the singing \nphoneme and that of the speech phoneme, i.e. a higher \ndifference between the likelihood scores implies greater \ndiscrepancy between the acoustic characteristics of the two \nsignals. \nThe likelihood score for each phoneme is a cumulative \nscore on all frames contained in that phoneme.  As durations \nof different phones vary significantly, the cumulative scores \ncould be misleading.  Thus we use the average likelihood \nscore, which is computed by dividing the cumulative score by \nthe frame count. \nThen, we define the Likelihood Difference (LD) as  \n \nLD = abs(ALSsinging \u2013 ALSspeech),                  (2) \n \nwhere ALSsinging and ALSspeech are the average likelihood \nscore for the singing phoneme and speech phoneme, \nrespectively.  As we only wished to gauge the extent of the \nlikelihood differences, the absolute value of the difference is \nused to avoid negative scores cancelling out positive ones. \nThe comparison of likelihood differences between singing \nand speech phonemes of all phoneme types are shown in Fig. \n9.  Results show that females have higher likelihood \ndifferences for all phoneme types, especially liquids, which \nimplies that there may be more differences in terms of \naccoustic features on female singing.  \nThe likelihood differences of affricates and fricatives are \nlower than the other categories, suggesting that the accoustic \nfeatures of these two phoneme types may be more similar \nbetween singing and speech. \nWhile the 39-dimentional MFCC feature vector preserves \nthe identity of the phoneme in question, it might have \nneglected information indicative of the difference between \nsinging and speech.  Therefore, likelihood difference is by no \nmeans a definitive measure on the differences of singing and \nspeech phonemes. However, our observations may provide \nclues for further studies. \nB. \nUnderstanding the effects of duration on MFCCs \nAs variations in phoneme duration is one of the major \ndifferences between speaking and singing, we conducted \npreliminary experiments to see if they affect the MFCC \nfeatures commonly used for speech analysis.  \nFor simplicity, we converted duration into a discrete \nvariable by dividing its whole value range into 10 bins with \nequal cumulative probability mass, i.e. each bin contains \naround 10% of the samples. Binning is carried out for each \nand every phoneme. We then estimate a single Gaussian to \nmodel the MFCC feature distribution for each bin of the \nphoneme. Ideally, there should be 390 different models, i.e. \n39 phonemes each having 10 duration bins.  Because the sung \nand spoken instances of a phoneme are binned together, the \nduration range of the sung instances could make it so that the \nspoken instances might not be distributed into all 10 bins, and \nvice versa. In the end, we obtained 348 separate models for \nspeech and 366 for singing.  \nWe then built decision trees to cluster these models \ntogether by asking questions based on the durations. For each \nphoneme, the 10 bins require 9 boundary values to split and \nhence 9 questions on the decision tree. The speech models \nand singing models are clustered separately. Clustering is \ncarried out at each step by selecting the question that \nincreases the data likelihood the most. If changes in a \nphoneme\u2019s MFCC features are affected by its duration, it \nwould be more difficult to reduce the number of model \nclusters across the duration range, resulting in a lower \nreduction rate after clustering. After the decision tree \n \nFig. 9  Mean Differences of Likelihood Scores for All Phoneme Categories \n\fclustering, we obtained 140 clusters for speech models and \n177 clusters for singing models. The relative model reduction \nrate is 59.78% and 51.64%, respectively.  \nC. \nUnderstanding the effects of pitch on MFCCs \nWe conducted the same set of experiments to evaluate the \neffects of pitch on the MFCC features. We also used 10 bins \nto discretize the pitch values and to ensure that all the bins \nhave balanced cumulative density masses. After binning, we \nobtained 334 models for speech and 342 for singing. After \ndecision tree building and clustering, the number of models \nwas reduced to 182 for speech and 259 for singing, yielding \nreduction rates of 45.51% and 24.27%, respectively. The \nreduction rate for singing data is much lower than that of \nspeaking data, especially when compared to the duration \nbased clustering, suggesting that pitch differences can bring \nmore variations to MFCC features. \nVI. CONCLUSION \nIn this paper, we introduce the NUS Sung and Spoken \nLyrics Corpus (NUS-48E Corpus), which is an ongoing effort \ntoward a comprehensive, well-annotated dataset for singing \nvoice related research.  The corpus contains: 12 subjects \nrepresenting various accents and extents of musical \nbackground; 48 songs with reasonably balanced phoneme \ndistribution.  To the best of our knowledge, the NUS-48E \ncorpus is the first singing voice dataset to offer annotations on \nthe phone level. \nUsing our corpus, we conducted a comparative study of \nsung and spoken lyrics.  Specifically, we investigated the \nduration and spectral characteristics of the phonemes in \nsinging and speech.  A preliminary analysis on the stretching \nratio of sung phonemes is presented.  Differences among \nstretching ratios of seven consonant categories are compared \nand the variations among subjects discussed.  We investigated \nthe syllabic proportion of consonants in sung lyrics with \nrespect to consonants types as well as consonant positions \nwithin the syllable.  Using a GMM-HMM system trained on a \nlarge speech corpus, we studied the difference between \nsinging and speech phonemes in terms of MFCC features. The \neffects of duration and pitch on acoustic features are also \ndiscussed.  The level of difference was measured through \nLikelihood Difference, which is based on the likelihood score \ngenerated by the GMM-HMM system. The effects of duration \nand pitch on MFCC features are examined by clustering \nacoustic models with decision trees. \nVII. FUTURE WORK \nWhile the NUS-48E corpus contains only 48 annotated \nsongs due to limitations on time and qualified manpower, we \nhave recorded a total of 420 song samples (21 subjects, each \nsinging all 20 songs in Table I).  On the one hand, we will \ncontinue to enlarge our corpus by annotating the remaining \nsongs. On the other hand, we will begin annotating the spoken \ndata in order to provide the ground truth for future \ncomparison studies.  Using the enlarged corpus, we would \nalso like to repeat some of the works mentioned in Section II \nto provide quantitative verifications for the observations \nreported in the literature. \nAs the comparison study presented in this paper is \npreliminary in nature, its results could be further explored and \nanalyzed.  Subsequent experiments will aim to answer the \nquestion and test the theory raised by the current observations, \nsuch as the differing syllabic proportions of consonants in \nmale subjects.  In the process, we hope to unearth new \nobservations and raise new questions that could advance the \ncommunity\u2019s understanding of the relationship between \nsinging voice and speech. Eventually, we seek to combine the \nknowledge gained from the corpus and the literature to better \nadapt state-of-the-art speech evaluation technologies for the \nsinging voice. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThe authors deeply appreciate the assistance of Kenny \nYang and Amelia Dizon with phonetic annotation.  \nThis research is supported by the Singapore National \nResearch Foundation under its International Research Centre \n@ Singapore Funding Initiative and administered by the IDM \nProgramme Office.  \nREFERENCES \n[1] S.

We hereby present the NUS Sung and Spoken Lyrics Corpus (NUS-48E corpus) as the first step toward a large, phonetically annotated corpus for singing voice research. The corpus is a 169-min collection of audio recordings of the sung and spoken lyrics of 48 (20 unique) English songs by 12 subjects and a complete set of transcriptions and duration annotations at the phone level for all recordings of sung lyrics, comprising 25,474 phone instances. Using the NUS-48E corpus, we conducted a preliminary, quantitative study on the comparison between singing voice and speech. The study includes duration analyses of the sung and spoken lyrics, with a primary focus on the behavior of consonants, and experiments aiming to gauge how acoustic representations of spoken and sung phonemes differ, as well as how duration and pitch variations may affect the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) features.\n\n## I Introduction\n\nIn audio signal analysis, it is important to understand the characteristics of singing voice and their relation to speech. A wide range of research problems, such as singing and speech discrimination and singing voice recognition, evaluation, and synthesis, stand to benefit from a more precise characterization of the singing voice. Better solutions to these research problems could then lead to technological advancements in numerous application scenarios, from music information retrieval and music edutainment to language learning [1] and speech therapy [2].\n\nGiven the similarity between singing and speech, many researchers classify the former as a type of the latter and try to utilize the well-established automatic speech recognition (ASR) framework to handle the singing voice [3][4][5]. Due to the lack of phonetically annotated singing datasets, models have been trained on speech corpora and then adapted to the singing voice. This approach, however, is intrinsically limited because the differences between singing and speech signals are not captured. Thus, a quantitative comparison of singing voice and speech could potentially improve the capability and robustness of current ASR systems in handling singing voice.\n\nDespite long-standing efforts to characterize various aspects of singing voice and their relations to speech [7][8], the lack of a suitable dataset has precluded any systematic quantitative study. Given that most existing models are statistics-based, an ideal dataset should not only have a large size but also exhibit sufficient diversity within the data. To explore the quantitative differences of singing and speech at the phone level, the research community needs a corpus of phonetically annotated recordings of sung and spoken lyrics by a diverse group of subjects.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce the NUS Sung and Spoken Lyrics Corpus (NUS-48E corpus for short), 48 English songs the lyrics of which are sung and read out by 12 subjects representing a variety of voice types and accents. There are 20 unique songs, each of which covered by at least one male and one female subject. The total length of audio recordings is 115 min for the singing data and 54 min for the speech data. All singing recordings have been phonetically transcribed with duration boundaries, and the total number of annotated phones is 25,474. The corpus marks the first step toward a large, phonetically annotated dataset for singing voice research.\n\nUsing the new corpus, we conducted a preliminary study on the quantitative comparison between sung and spoken lyrics. Unlike in speech, the durations of syllables and phonemes in singing are constrained by the music score. They have much larger variations and often undergo stretching. While vowel stretching is largely dependent on the tempo, rhythm, and articulation specified in the score, consonant stretching is much less well understood. We thus conducted duration analyses of the singing and speech data, primarily focusing on consonants. We also hope to better understand how one can borrow from and improve upon the state-of-the-art speech processing techniques to handle singing data. We thus carried out experiments to quantify how the acoustic representations of spoken and sung phonemes differ, as well as how variations in duration and pitch may affect the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) features. The results of both the duration and spectral analyses are hereby presented and discussed.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II provides an overview of existing datasets and related works on the differences between singing and speech. Section III describes the collection, annotation, and composition of the NUS-48E corpus. Section IV and V present the results of the duration analyses and spectral comparisons, respectively. Finally, Section VI and VII conclude this paper and suggest future work.\n\n### _Singing Voice Dataset_\n\nSinging datasets of various sizes and annotated contents are available for research purposes. To the best of our knowledge, however, none has duration annotations at the phoneme level.\n\nMesaros and Virtanen conducted automatic recognition of sung lyrics using 49 singing clips, 19 of which are from male singers and 30 from female singers [4]. Each clip is 20-30 seconds long, and the complete dataset amounts to approximately 30 minutes. Although a total of 4770 phoneme instances are present, the lyrics of each singing clip are manually transcribed only at the word level, without any duration boundaries.\n\nThe MIR-1K dataset [6] is a larger dataset consisting of 1000 clips from 110 unique Chinese songs as sung by 19 amateur singers, 8 of whom female. The total length of the singing clips is 133 minutes. Since this dataset is intended for singing voice separation, annotations consist of pitch, lyrics, unvoiced frame types, and vocal/non-vocal segmentation, but do not contain segmentation on the word level or below.\n\nAIST Humming Database (AIST-HDB) [9] is a large database for singing and humming research. The database contains a total of 125.9 hours of humming/singing/reading materials, recorded from 100 subjects. Each subject produced 100 excerpts of 50 songs chosen from the RWC Music Database (RWC-MDB) [16]. While the lyrics of the songs are known, neither the AIST-HDB nor the RWC-MDB provides any phoneme or word boundary annotation.\n\n### _Differences of Singing and Speech_\n\nObservations on differences of singing and speech have been reported and studied [7][8]. The three main differences lie in phoneme duration, pitch, and power. Constrained by the music score and performance conventions, the singing voice stretches phonemes, stabilizes pitches, and roams within a wider pitch range. The power changes with pitch in singing but not in speech.\n\nOhishi et al. studied the human capability in discriminating singing and speaking voices [10]. They reported that human subjects could distinguish singing and speaking with 70.0% accuracy for 200-ms signals and 99.7% for one-second signals. The results suggest that both temporal characteristics and short-term spectral features contribute to perceptual judgment. The same research group also investigated short-term MFCC features and long-term contour of the fundamental frequency (F0) in order to improve machine perform on singing-speaking discrimination [8]. F0 contour works better for signals longer than one second, while MFCC performs better on shorter signals. The combination of the short-term and long-term features achieved more than 90% accuracy for two-second signals.\n\nSince singing and speech are similar from various aspects, finding the right set of features to discriminate the two is crucial. A set of features derived from harmonic coefficient and its 4Hz modulation values are proposed in [11]. While in [12], a feature selection solution among 276 features is introduced.\n\n### _Conversion between Singing and Speech_\n\nThe conversion between speaking and singing has also attracted research interest. A system for speech-to-singing synthesis is described in [13]. By modifying the F0, phoneme duration, and spectral characteristics, the system can synthesize a singing voice with naturalness almost comparable to a real singing voice using a speaking voice and the corresponding text as input. A similar system is developed in [14] to convert spoken vowels into singing vowels. On the other hand, the SpeakBySinging [15] system converts a singing voice into a speaking voice while retaining the timbre of the singing voice.\n\n## III The NUS Sung and Spoken Lyrics Corpus\n\n### _Audio Data Collection_\n\n**Song Selection.** We selected twenty songs in English as the basis of our corpus (see Table I). They include well-known traditional songs and popular songs that have been regional and international hits, as well as several songs that may be less familiar but are chosen for their phonemic richness and ease of learning. In addition, lyrics of some songs, such as _Jingle Bells_ and _Twinkle Twinkle Little Star_, are expanded to include verses other than the most familiar ones to further enhance the phonemic richness of the corpus, while overly repetitive lines or instances of sant singing, such as those found in _Far Away from Home_ and _Lemon Tree_, are excised to better preserve phonemic balance. The list of songs and their selected lyrics are posted on our study website1.\n\nFootnote 1: [http://singingevaluation.wordpress.com/2012/11/22/songs-to-pick/](http://singingevaluation.wordpress.com/2012/11/22/songs-to-pick/)\n\n**Subject Profile.** We recruited 21 subjects, 9 males and 12 females, from the National University of Singapore (NUS) Choir and the amateur vocal community at NUS. All subjects are enrolled students or staff of the university. They are 21 to 27 years of age and come with a wide range of musical exposure, from no formal musical training to more than 10 years of vocal ensemble experience and vocal training. All four major voice types (soprano, alto, tenor, and bass) are represented, as well as a spectrum of English accents, from North American to the various accents commonly found in Singapore. Local accents tend to be less apparent in singing than in speaking, a phenomenon that becomes more marked as the subject's vocal experience increases. Subjects are all proficient speakers of English, if not native speakers.\n\n**Collection Procedure.** Subjects visited the study website to familiarize with the lyrics of all twenty songs before coming to our sound-proof recording studio (STC 50+) for data collection. An Audio-Technica 4050 microphone with pop filter was used for the recording. Audio data were collected at 16-bit and 44.1kHz using Pro Tools 9, which also generated a metronome with downbeat accent to set the tempi and to serve as a guide for singing. The metronome was fed to the subject via the headphone. The selected lyrics for all songs were printed and placed on a music stand by themicrophone for the subject's reference. Except metronome beats heard through the headphone, no other accompaniment was provided, and subjects were recorded a cappella.\n\nFor each song, the selected lyrics were sung first. While the tempo was set, the subject could choose a comfortable key and were free to make small alterations to rhythm and pitch. Then, the subject's reading of the lyrics was recorded on a separate track. When a track with all the lyrics clearly sung or spoken was obtained, the subject proceeded to the next song. A few pronunciation errors were allowed as long as the utterance remained clear. Except the occasional rustles of the lyrics printouts, miscellaneous noise was avoided or excised from the recording as much as possible.\n\nFor each subject, an average of 65 minutes of audio data was thus collected in 20 singing (~45min) and 20 reading tracks (~20min). Each track was then bounced from Pro Tools as a wav file for subsequent storage, annotation, and audio analyses. At the end of the recording session, we reimbursed each subject with a SS50 gift voucher for the university co-op store.\n\n### _Data Annotation_\n\nWe adopted the 39-phoneme set used by the CMU Dictionary (see Table II) for phonetic annotation [17]. Three annotators used Audacity to create a label track for each audio file, and labeled phones and their timestamps are exported as a text file. Phones were labeled not according to their dictionary pronunciation in American English but as they had been uttered. This was done to better capture the effect of singing as well as the singer's accent on the standard pronunciation. We also included two extra labels, _sil_ and _sp_, to mark the lengths of silence or inhalation between words (and, occasionally, between phones mid-word) and all duration-less word boundaries, respectively (see Fig. 1). Labels of one annotator were checked by another to ensure inter-rater consistency.\n\n### _Corpus Composition_\n\nDue to the time-consuming nature of phonetic transcription and the limitations on manpower, for the first version of the corpus we only manually annotated the singing data of 12 subjects. They include 6 males and 6 females and represent all voice types and accent types (see Table III). For each subject, we selected 4 songs to annotate. To ensure that all 20 songs were annotated at least once for both genders and that the number of annotated phones for each subject remained roughly equal, we ranked the songs by the number of phones estimated using the CMU Dictionary and assigned them accordingly (see Table I). At this stage, each subject hasaround 2100 phones annotated, and the corpus contains a total of 25,474 phone instances.\n\nAnnotation for spoken lyrics is generated by aligning the manually-labeled phone strings of the sung lyrics to the spoken lyrics using conventional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) - Hidden Markov Model (HMM) system trained on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ0) corpus (see Sec. 5 for details). While numerous discrepancies might exist between the actual sung and spoken versions, arising from the articulatory peculiarities of subjects and the differing methods of alignment, the annotated spoken lyrics allow us to make broad and preliminary observations about the extent of phonemic stretching between sung and spoken lyrics. As part of our future work, we will expand our corpus to include manual annotations of the spoken lyrics.\n\n## IV Duration Analysis\n\n### _Consonants Stretching_\n\nIn singing, vowels are stretched to maintain musical notes for certain durations, and their durations are to a large extent dictated by the score. While the stretching of vowels is much more pronounced, consonants are nevertheless stretched at a non-trivial level (see Fig. 2). As the factors influencing consonant duration are less apparent than those for vowels, we will explore not only how much stretching takes place but also what may affect the amount of stretching.\n\nThe stretching ratio is computed as follows,\n\n\\[sr=T_{s\\mathit{s\\mathit{s\\mathit{s\\mathit{s\\mathit{s\\mathit{s\\mathit{s\\mathit{s \\mathit{s\\mathit{s\\mathit{s\\mathit{s\\mathit{s\\mathit{s\\mathit{s\\mathit{s\\mathit{s}}}}}}}}}}}}}}/T_{ speech}\\, \\tag{1}\\]\n\nwhere \\(sr\\) is the stretching ratio and \\(T_{\\mathit{s\\mathit{s\\mathit{s\\mathit{s\\mathit{s\\mathit{s\\mathit{s\\mathit{s \\mathit{s\\mathit{s\\mathit{s\\mathit{s\\mathit{s\\mathit{s\\mathit{s\\mathit{s\\mathit{s \\mathit{s\\mathit{s}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}\\) and \\(T_{\\mathit{speech}}\\) the durations of the phoneme in singing and the corresponding speech, respectively. The higher the \\(sr\\) value, the more the phoneme is stretched in singing.\n\nIn the speech-to-singing conversion system developed in [13], the authors use fixed ratios for different types of consonants. The ratios used are experimentally determined from observations of singing and speech signals. Using the NUS-48E corpus, we analyzed the stretching ratio of\n\nFig. 1: SIL and SP labels denoting boundaries\n\nFig. 2: Comparison on Duration Stretching of Vowels and Consonants in singing consonants. Given that the phoneme alignment on speech data is automatically generated with a speech recognizer while the phoneme boundaries on singing data are manually annotated, the results remain preliminary observations.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 3, among the 7 types of consonants compared, liquids, semivowels, and nasals exhibit larger stretching ratios (2.2371, 1.9852, and 1.7027, respectively.) This result conforms to the intuition that these types of sonorants could be sustained and articulated for a longer period of time than others types such as stops and affricates.\n\nAnother interesting question is how the consonants are stretched in syllables of various lengths. The length of the syllables may have an effect on the length of consonants. As shown in Fig. 4, when syllable length starts to grow, the stretching ratio of semivowels increases accordingly. After the syllable length reaches around 1 second, however, the stretching ratio of semivowels tends to decrease. Not surprisingly, since vowels are the dominant constituent of syllables, the stretching ratio of vowels keeps growing when syllables become longer.\n\nObservations on other types of consonants are similar to that discussed above for semivowels.\n\n### _Subject Variations on Consonants Stretching_\n\nAs observations in the previous section only describe an overarching trend across all consonants for all subjects, it is important to check whether individual subjects follow such a trend consistently. We first investigated the differences with respect to gender. Fig. 5 shows the probability density functions (PDF) for the stretching ratios of both gender groups. The difference between them is negligible, suggesting that consonant stretching ratio is gender-independent. Next, we compared individual subjects. For example, subjects 05 and 08 contributed the same 4 songs, _Do Re Mi_, _Jingle Bells_, _Moon River_, and _Lemon Tree_. Subject 05 is a female with Malay accent and has had two years of choral experience at the time of recording, while subject 06 is a male with northern Chinese accent and had no vocal training whatsoever. As Fig. 6 shows, the distributions of the consonant stretching ratios of the two subjects remain roughly the same despite individual differences in accent and musical exposure. Therefore, the extent of consonant stretching may be attributed more to the act of singing itself than any discrepancy in the vocal practice of the singers.\n\n### _Syllable Proportions of Consonants_\n\nSyllable proportions are calculated as quotients of the consonant durations and the syllable durations. A phone with longer duration might not take up a higher proportion as it may be part of a long syllable.\n\nFigure 7 shows the syllabic proportion for all consonant types and both gender groups. Overall, semivowels have the highest proportion while aspirates and stops have the lowest. With aspirates as the lone exception, the syllabic proportions of all consonant types are higher in males than in females.\n\nFig. 4: Comparison on Duration Stretching Ratio across Different Length of Syllables for Vowels and Semivowels\n\nFig. 3: Average Stretching Ratios of Seven Types of ConsonantsFurther observation confirms that the absolute duration lengths of both consonants and syllables are larger in male subjects. This is an unexpected and interesting phenomenon given the observation made in the last subsection, namely that consonant durations seem to be stretched to similar extents in subjects of both genders.\n\nThree factors could contribute to such a phenomenon. First, male and female subjects may have somewhat different duration distributions for consonants and vowels within the spoken syllables to begin with. Second, the stretching of sung vowels could exhibit gender-related discrepancies. Lastly, structure of the same syllable in the lyrics could be different between speech and singing, especially for subjects who would sing in a different accent. A dropped consonant or a diphthongized vowel could alter syllable makeup and affect syllable length. Once we have expanded our corpus to include phonetic annotations for the spoken lyrics, we plan to further our comparison study to examine these factors.\n\n### _Consonant Position and its Effect on Proportion_\n\nWithin a syllable, consonants may appear at different positions. For example, in the word _love_ (/l /ah/ /v/), consonant /l/ is located at the beginning of the word; while in _soul_ (/s /ow/ /l), it is at the end. We are interested to see whether this positioning has any effect on the syllabic proportion. We first defined four consonant positions:\n\n1. **Starting**: at the beginning of a word, e.g. /g/ in _go_\n2. **Preceding**: preceding a vowel, but not at the beginning of a word, e.g. /m/ in _small_\n3. **Succeeding**: succeeding a vowel, but not at the end of a word, e.g. /l/ in _angels_\n4. **Ending**: at the end of a word, e.g. /t/ in _at_\n\nWe compared the syllabic proportions for the seven consonant categories with respect to positioning. The results are shown in Fig. 8. Semivowels and stops at the starting position are much more prominent than those at the end, while the opposite is observed for affricates and nasals. The syllabic proportions of fricatives, aspirates and liquids are largely similar between the starting and ending position.\n\nFor all consonants, the proportion for preceding position is significantly lower than that of the starting one. The phenomenon is mirrored for the succeeding and ending positions, in which the latter is much more prominent than the former.\n\n## V Spectral Analysis\n\nAlthough we could build a conventional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) - Hidden Markov Model (HMM) system using the NUS-48E corpus, the performance is expected to be low mainly due to the following two factors: the limited amount of speech data and the variation of accents among the subjects. While few large, high-quality singing corpora are available for academic research, there are numerous standard speech corpora. We adopted the Wall Street Journal (WSJ0) corpus, a large collection of read speech with texts drawn from a machine-readable corpus of Wall Street Journal news,\n\nFigure 8: Proportion comparison of consonants in different positions\n\nFigure 6: Comparison on Consonants Duration Stretching Ratio of Subject 05 and Subject 08\n\nFigure 7: Mean syllabic proportions for different types of consonants\n\nto train our speech GMM-HMM system, which is built to maximize the likelihood of the training data using the Hidden Markov Model Toolkit (HTK). The system adopts the CMU phoneme set used in the NUS-48E corpus and has a total of 2419 tied triphone states to model the various phoneme realizations in different acoustic contexts. Each state is modeled by a GMM with 16 components. On the benchmark 5k close vocabulary speech recognition task, our model has a word error rate (WER) of 5.51% when decoding with the bigram language model.\n\nFor comparison purpose, we also built a simple monophone based GMM-HMM system using the singing data of the NUS-48E corpus. Instead of the doing automatic alignment of the training data, we fixed the phoneme boundary according to the human annotations during training. Similarly, this singing GMM-HMM system also has 16 Gaussian for each state.\n\nBoth the speaking and singing waveform signals are processed with a 25ms time window and a shift of 10ms. Twelve dimensional MFCC features together with an energy term are extracted from each time window. These 13 terms, along with their first order and second order derivatives, make up the final, 39-dimensional feature vector.\n\n### _Phoneme likelihood score comparison_\n\nThe GMM-HMM system trained on the WSJ0 corpus captures the spectral characteristics of the speech signals, and we used it to perform alignment on both the speech and singing data in the NUS-48E corpus. The alignment on singing data was restricted with the manually labeled boundaries. During both alignment tasks, the likelihood score generated by the GMM-HMM system were stored. Since the system is trained on a speech corpus, it is expected to perform worse on singing data. However, the difference between the likelihood scores of singing and speech phonemes carries useful information. It can serve as an indirect measure of the distance between the acoustic representation of the singing phoneme and that of the speech phoneme, i.e. a higher difference between the likelihood scores implies greater discrepancy between the acoustic characteristics of the two signals.\n\nThe likelihood score for each phoneme is a cumulative score on all frames contained in that phoneme. As durations of different phones vary significantly, the cumulative scores could be misleading. Thus we use the average likelihood score, which is computed by dividing the cumulative score by the frame count.\n\nThen, we define the _Likelihood Difference (LD)_ as\n\n\\[LD=abs(ALS_{\\textit{singing}}-ALS_{\\textit{speech}}), \\tag{2}\\]\n\nwhere \\(ALS_{\\textit{singing}}\\) and \\(ALS_{\\textit{speech}}\\) are the average likelihood score for the singing phoneme and speech phoneme, respectively. As we only wished to gauge the extent of the likelihood differences, the absolute value of the difference is used to avoid negative scores cancelling out positive ones.\n\nThe comparison of likelihood differences between singing and speech phonemes of all phoneme types are shown in Fig. 9. Results show that females have higher likelihood differences for all phoneme types, especially liquids, which implies that there may be more differences in terms of acoustic features on female singing.\n\nThe likelihood differences of affricates and fricatives are lower than the other categories, suggesting that the acoustic features of these two phoneme types may be more similar between singing and speech.\n\nWhile the 39-dimentional MFCC feature vector preserves the identity of the phoneme in question, it might have neglected information indicative of the difference between singing and speech. Therefore, likelihood difference is by no means a definitive measure on the differences of singing and speech phonemes. However, our observations may provide clues for further studies.\n\n### _Understanding the effects of duration on MFCCs_\n\nAs variations in phoneme duration is one of the major differences between speaking and singing, we conducted preliminary experiments to see if they affect the MFCC features commonly used for speech analysis.\n\nFor simplicity, we converted duration into a discrete variable by dividing its whole value range into 10 bins with equal cumulative probability mass, i.e. each bin contains around 10% of the samples. Binning is carried out for each and every phoneme. We then estimate a single Gaussian to model the MFCC feature distribution for each bin of the phoneme. Ideally, there should be 390 different models, i.e. 39 phonemes each having 10 duration bins. Because the sung and spoken instances of a phoneme are binned together, the duration range of the sung instances could make it so that the spoken instances might not be distributed into all 10 bins, and vice versa. In the end, we obtained 348 separate models for speech and 366 for singing.\n\nWe then built decision trees to cluster these models together by asking questions based on the durations. For each phoneme, the 10 bins require 9 boundary values to split and hence 9 questions on the decision tree. The speech models and singing models are clustered separately. Clustering is carried out at each step by selecting the question that increases the data likelihood the most. If changes in a phoneme's MFCC features are affected by its duration, it would be more difficult to reduce the number of model clusters across the duration range, resulting in a lower reduction rate after clustering. After the decision tree\n\nFig. 9: Mean Differences of Likelihood Scores for All Phoneme Categoriesclustering, we obtained 140 clusters for speech models and 177 clusters for singing models. The relative model reduction rate is 59.78% and 51.64%, respectively.\n\n### _Understanding the effects of pitch on MFCCs_\n\nWe conducted the same set of experiments to evaluate the effects of pitch on the MFCC features. We also used 10 bins to discretize the pitch values and to ensure that all the bins have balanced cumulative density masses. After binning, we obtained 334 models for speech and 342 for singing. After decision tree building and clustering, the number of models was reduced to 182 for speech and 259 for singing, yielding reduction rates of 45.51% and 24.27%, respectively. The reduction rate for singing data is much lower than that of speaking data, especially when compared to the duration based clustering, suggesting that pitch differences can bring more variations to MFCC features.\n\n## VI Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we introduce the NUS Sung and Spoken Lyrics Corpus (NUS-48E Corpus), which is an ongoing effort toward a comprehensive, well-annotated dataset for singing voice related research. The corpus contains: 12 subjects representing various accents and extents of musical background; 48 songs with reasonably balanced phoneme distribution. To the best of our knowledge, the NUS-48E corpus is the first singing voice dataset to offer annotations on the phone level.\n\nUsing our corpus, we conducted a comparative study of sung and spoken lyrics. Specifically, we investigated the duration and spectral characteristics of the phonemes in singing and speech. A preliminary analysis on the stretching ratio of sung phonemes is presented. Differences among stretching ratios of seven consonant categories are compared and the variations among subjects discussed. We investigated the syllabic proportion of consonants in sung lyrics with respect to consonants types as well as consonant positions within the syllable. Using a GMM-HMM system trained on a large speech corpus, we studied the difference between singing and speech phonemes in terms of MFCC features. The effects of duration and pitch on acoustic features are also discussed. The level of difference was measured through _Likelihood Difference_, which is based on the likelihood score generated by the GMM-HMM system. The effects of duration and pitch on MFCC features are examined by clustering acoustic models with decision trees.\n\n## VII Future Work\n\nWhile the NUS-48E corpus contains only 48 annotated songs due to limitations on time and qualified manpower, we have recorded a total of 420 song samples (21 subjects, each singing all 20 songs in Table I). On the one hand, we will continue to enlarge our corpus by annotating the remaining songs. On the other hand, we will begin annotating the spoken data in order to provide the ground truth for future comparison studies. Using the enlarged corpus, we would also like to repeat some of the works mentioned in Section II to provide quantitative verifications for the observations reported in the literature.\n\nAs the comparison study presented in this paper is preliminary in nature, its results could be further explored and analyzed. Subsequent experiments will aim to answer the question and test the theory raised by the current observations, such as the differing syllabic proportions of consonants in male subjects. In the process, we hope to unearth new observations and raise new questions that could advance the community's understanding of the relationship between singing voice and speech. Eventually, we seek to combine the knowledge gained from the corpus and the literature to better adapt state-of-the-art speech evaluation technologies for the singing voice.\n\n## Acknowledgment\n\nThe authors deeply appreciate the assistance of Kenny Yang and Amelia Dizon with phonetic annotation.\n\nThis research is supported by the Singapore National Research Foundation under its International Research Centre _(a)_ Singapore Funding Initiative and administered by the IDM Programme Office.\n\n## References\n\n* [1] S.

INTRODUCTION\nMusic performance is one of the most essential activities\nin music. Good performance requires not only translating\nnotes in the score into physical actions with precise timing\nand right pitch on an instrument but also delivering emotions and messages through subtle controls of tempo, dynamics, articulations and other expressive elements.\nThere have been research interests in modeling expressive performance using a computational method. A recent review paper comprehensively summarized the history [4]. While some of previous work exploited computational modeling as a tool for understanding how humans perform [3], or listen to music [10], others focused\non automatically generating expressive performances. The\nprevious methods include rule-based approaches [2, 8], or\nprobabilistic models [17, 29], and an artificial neural network [5,11]. The instrument is mainly limited to piano because it is relatively easy to quantify the performances.\nc\u20dd Dasaem Jeong, Taegyun Kwon, Yoojin Kim, Kyogu Lee,\nJuhan Nam.

Others introduced DNN models for generating polyphonic music with expressive timing and dynamics [13,24]. While these models can generate performance\nMIDI notes, they are more like music composition models\nrather than expressive performance models that take music scores as input. Besides piano performance, a recent\nwork presented DNN-based system for modeling expressive drum performance [9].\nOne of the bottlenecks in the DNN-based approach is\nthe lack of dataset [4]. Since the task is rendering expressive performances from score inputs, the dataset should\nconsist of music scores and their corresponding performances by human musicians. Furthermore, the pair of\nscore and performance should be aligned in note-level to\neffectively train the model. Also, ideally, the list of music score and performance should cover various composers\nand performance styles.\nIn this paper, we present a hierarchical RNN-based\nmodel for expressive piano performance along with a\ndataset that we organized. The model takes MusicXML\nas input and generates performance MIDI with expressive\ntempo, dynamics, articulation and pedaling. The model\nconsists of RNN with hierarchical attention network and\nconditional variational autoencoder (CVAE). In particular,\nthe model predicts the performance features using a multiscale approach; it first predicts tempo and dynamics in\nmeasure-level and, based on the result, fine-tunes them in\nnote-level. A listening test with professional pianists shows\nthat our model achieves a more human-like expressiveness\ncompared to previous models.\n2. DATASET\n2.1 Performance and Score Data\nAs aforementioned, we need a dataset of human performances with their corresponding music scores to train a\nneural network model. A list of expressive performance\ndatasets are summarized in [4]. Among others, Yamaha\n908\n\fSignature MIDI collection 1 , which are recorded during\nYamaha e-Competitions with computer-controlled pianos,\nis the largest public dataset that provides a substantial\namount of expressive performance MIDI of professional\npianists. Some of the pianists performed the same piece\nmore than once in different rounds of the competition in\ndifferent years. The Yamaha collection has been employed\nin automatic performance generation [24] and automatic\nmusic transcription and audio synthesis [12] as well.\nWhile the Yamaha collection provides high-quality piano performance data in MIDI, it does not contain the corresponding music scores of the pieces. Thus, we collected\nthe score files from another source. Specifically, we downloaded them from MuseScore, a community-based web\nplatform of music score 2 . The scores were transcribed voluntarily by the community users and can be exported in\nMusicXML format. We also included our own transcriptions of scores to the dataset. While MIDI is suitable for\nrepresenting performance, MusicXML aims to represent\nthe Western music notation in its entirety. Therefore, MusicXML can contain various types of musical symbols such\nas rest, slur, beam, barline, key and time signature, articulation, ornament markings and so on, which are excluded\nin MIDI format.\n2.2 Data Matching and Refinement\nSince we collected the performance and score data from\ndifferent sources, we had to match and refine them. In\nparticular, transcription styles in the crowdsourced MusicXML files are not consistent. For example, some of\nthe transcribers add extra expressions such as dynamics markings or tempo change to make the score sounds\nmore expressive. They usually set them to \u201cinvisible objects\u201d to make the transcribed score appear as the reference score. We deleted such extra markings added by transcribers. Also, we manually checked whether the performances followed the repetitions in the scores. If a performance skipped the repetition, we omitted the repetition\nfrom the score so that the performance and the score can\nbe aligned.\nTo train a model with note-level score features and\nperformance features, each note in the score should be\nmatched to that in the performance. We employed a scoreto-performance alignment algorithm proposed by Nakamura et al. [23]. The algorithm automatically handles asynchronously performed notes as well as missing and extra\nnotes in the performance, and returns a list of note-to-note\nmatches. Although the algorithm showed high accuracy in\nour test, a small amount of alignment errors can be critical\nin extracting performance features such as tempo or onset\ndeviation. Since the dataset is too large to make manual\ncorrections, we filtered out some erroneous matches based\non simple rules and excluded them in training the performance model. For example, if a matched performance note\nis too close or even earlier than the previous note in the\nscore, we regarded it as an alignment error. Also, if multi-\n1 http://www.yamahaden.com/midi-files\n2 https://musescore.com\nple notes have the same onset time in the score (e.g., chord\nnotes) but one is too far from other notes in performance,\nwe regarded it as an alignment error as well.\nWe found that this additional refinement made severe\nimprovement on the training result, especially on onset deviation, or micro-timing, of individual notes. The standard\ndeviation of onset deviation decreases from 7.369 to 0.053\nafter the refinement, where the unit is quarter-notes. Without the refinement, the prediction of onset deviation became too noisy that one could not perceive correct rhythm.\nAs a result, we collected music scores of 226 pieces\nby 16 composers in MusicXML and 1,052 piano performances in MIDI. After the matching and refinement, the\nscore and performance data contain a total of 666,918\nnotes and 3,547,683 notes, respectively. Among the performance notes, 131,095 notes were failed to be aligned\nwith score notes, and additional 114,914 notes were excluded by our refinement algorithm. The number of valid\nperformance notes is ten times larger than the Magaloff\ncorpus [7], which is the largest existing dataset for classical piano music [4].\n3. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE\n3.1 Background\n3.1.1 Input and Output Features\nDesigning input and output features is an important issue in\nperformance modeling because it defines the characteristics of the computational task [4]. We followed the scheme\nwe previously proposed in [15], which covers a wide range\nof score and performance features. The score features include pitch, duration, articulation marking, slur and beam\nstatus, tempo marking, dynamic markings, and so on. The\nperformance features include absolute tempo, velocity, onset deviation, articulation and pedal usages. All the features\nare encoded in the note-level so that each note had the same\ndimension of score features and performance features.\n3.1.2 Hierarchical Attention Network\nRecent research has shown that a hierarchical approach can\nimprove the performance of RNN model in modeling sequential data [6, 30]. It was also demonstrated that the hierarchical approach has advantages in generating symbolic\nmusic data [25]. In this paper, we employ a hierarchical\nattention network (HAN) to predict a sequence of performance features from a sequence of score features.\nThe HAN composes higher-level representations by\nsummarizing lower-level representations in pre-defined hierarchical boundaries using a weighted sum. In our case,\nwe set beat and measure as the hierarchical boundaries so\nthat beat-level attention and measure-level attention summarize note-level and beat-level representations, respectively. Instead of directly implementing the HAN in [30],\nwe combined it with the idea of multi-head attention [28]\nwhich splits the dimension into several heads and applies\ndifferent weights of attention for each split.\nComposing nodes through the attention layers can be\ndescribed as follows. For each hierarchical boundary,\nProceedings of the 20th ISMIR Conference, Delft, Netherlands, November 4-8, 2019\n909\n\fFigure 1. The overview of the proposed system.\nwhich can be a beat or a measure in music score, the notes\nin the boundary can be indexed with t \u2208 [Bf, Bl], where\nBf and Bl represent the index of the first and last notes in\nthe selected boundary B. The lower-level hidden states ht\nfor t in the boundary B are summarized by context attention to compose a higher-level node m. There are a total I\nnumber of attention heads indexed with i.\nut = tanh(Waht + ba)\nui\nt = ut,i:(i+1)d\nhi\nt = ht,i:(i+1)d\n\u03b1\u03b1\u03b1i\nv =\nexp(ui\nt\n\u22baui\nc)\n\ufffd\nt exp(ui\nt\u22bauic)\nmi =\n\ufffd\nt\n\u03b1\u03b1\u03b1i\nt \u2217 hi\nt\nm = Concat(m0, ..., mI)\n(1)\nwhere Wa and ba denote weight and bias parameters of attention, and uc denotes a context vector representing query\nfor importance, which are trainable parameters. The sequence of summarized nodes are fed into a new layer of\nLSTM.\n3.1.3 Conditional VAE\nA music score can be interpreted and performed in various\nstyles, i.e. with a different tempo or phrasing. Therefore it\nis important to enable the performance modeling system to\ngenerate different types of performance. On the other hand,\nthe variation of performance can be an obstacle for training the model, because it has to generate different outputs\nfrom the same input. To solve this problem we employed\na conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), which we\nproposed in our previous work [14].\nVAE is a widely used generative models based on deep\nneural networks [19]. It is a type of autoencoder, which\ncompresses input information into a lower dimensional latent vector and decodes the original information from the\ncompressed latent vector. The main difference is that VAE\nconstrains its latent vector to be sampled from a probability distribution. VAE consists of an encoder that models\nq(z|x) and decoder to model p(x|z). VAE also models the\nprobability of latent vector p(z), which usually has a normal distribution. The training loss of VAE can be define as\nfollows:\nLVAE = Lrec + \u03b2DKL[(q(z|x)||p(z)]\n(2)\nwhere Lrec is the reconstruction error from AE, DKL is\nKullback-Leibler divergence (KLD), and \u03b2 is a weight for\nthe KLD.\nFigure 2. Diagram for Score Encoder with HAN and RNN\nA conditional VAE (CVAE) provides an additional condition so that the output satisfies the given condition [27].\nIn our system, the condition is the learned score representation, and the target output are the performance features.\nThe idea of employing CVAE for expressive performance\nmodeling was first proposed in [21]. While the previous\nwork encoded the latent vector in note-level, our idea is to\nencode the performance style in a longer-level, such as an\nentire piece.\n3.2 Proposed System\nOur proposed system consists of three parts: score encoder, performance encoder, and performance decoder as\ndepicted in Figure 1.\nThe role of score encoder is to learn score representations C from an input sequence of notes. It consists of three\nhierarchical-levels: note, beat, and measure. Each level has\na corresponding bidirectional LSTM unit with a different\nhidden size and number of layers. The note-level layer consists of two different LSTM units, one taking the input as\na single sequence, and the other taking the input as voiceseparated sequences. The \u201cvoice\u201d means the voice index in\nMusicXML that represents an independent stream of music as depicted with different colors of notes in Figure 2.\nThe hidden representations of the lower-level are summarized through the HAN to compose higher-level nodes. The\noutput of the note-level LSTM is summarized to beat-level\nnodes and then they are fed into the beat-level LSTM. Similarly, we compose the measure-level LSTM. We concatenate the outputs of all the three layers in a note-level as\ndepicted in Figure 2. The output of score encoder is a sequence with the same length as the input. Since we use\nmulti-head attention instead of single-head attention, each\nattention head focuses on the different type of notes as illustrated in Figure 3.\nWe implemented the performance encoder using CVAE\nthat models q(z|C, y) to summarize the given performance\ny in score condition C to a probability distribution of the\nProceedings of the 20th ISMIR Conference, Delft, Netherlands, November 4-8, 2019\n910\n\fFigure 3. Visualization of attention weights from different\nattention heads. a) focuses more on the melody notes while\nb) focuses more on the bass or harmonic notes.\nFigure 4. The figure shows how the beat-level decoder\nand the note-level decoder feed its results to the other. The\ndashed lines in red indicate the edge of beats.\nlatent vector z, which can be regarded as a performance\nstyle vector. C and y are concatenated and fed into a single\ndense layer that contracts the feature dimension. We use\nuni-directional note-level LSTM and measure-level HANLSTM to process the contracted input. The last output of\nthe sequence from the measure-level LSTM is used to infer\n\u00b5 and \u03c3 of q(z|C, y) by a dense layer.\nDuring the actual performance generation from a given\nscore, the performance encoding is bypassed, and the system randomly samples the style vector z from a normal\ndistribution or exploits a pre-encoded z from other performances.\nThe performance decoder uses LSTMs to generate a sequence of performance features \u02c6y for the given condition C\nand the style vector z. Since the tempo is always estimated\nin beat level, we have two different LSTM units, one in\nthe beat-level and the other in the note-level. Both LSTMs\nare in auto-regressive, i.e., take their own output from the\nprevious step as an input, and the outputs of the note-level\ndecoder is fed into the beat-level decoder, and vice versa,\nas presented in Figure 4.\n3.3 Measure-level Module\nOne of the main difficulties in expressive performance\nmodeling is achieving long-term expression such as gradual change of tempo or contrast between loud and quiet\nsections. To solve this problem, we propose an optional\nmeasure-level module that predicts measure-level tempo\nand dynamics as presented in Figure 5. The main idea is\nto make our system predict overall progress of the perfor-\nFigure 5. Diagram for Measure-level modules\nmance in measure-level and then refine it in note-level. A\nsimilar idea achieved a successive result in image generation using GAN, which started training in a low resolution\nand progressively in higher resolutions [16].\nTo train the measure-level module, we have to define measure-level performance features. The measurelevel tempo is defined by elapsed time to play the measure divided by the length of the measure in quarter-notes.\nWe used average velocities of notes in the measure for a\nmeasure-level dynamics. The measure-level module has almost the same architecture with the note-level modules except that the output of the score encoder is the measurelevel states instead of concatenated result of note, beat and\nmeasure hidden states. The performance encoder and decoder are also in measure level.\nIn this hierarchical approach, the note-level module\ntakes not only the score data but also the output of the\nmeasure-level module as a concatenated input. It is possible to combine two modules as a single model or in a\nsingle training process, but we made two modules independent and trained them separately. Therefore, the note-level\nmodule is trained with ground-truth measure-level outputs.\n4. EXPERIMENTS\n4.1 Training\nWe split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets\nso that each set has a size of approximately 8:1:1 in the\nnumber of piece, performance, and notes, while considering the distribution of composers in each set. A single piece\nwas included only in either of one of the splits. For the\ntraining set, we sliced the input sequences at the measure\nboundaries with the least size of 500 notes. When training\nthe measure-level module, the sequence has at least 2000\nnotes or entire notes if the piece is short. The note is ordered by its appearance order and pitch. The features with\ncontinuous value was normalized to have zero mean and\nunit standard deviation.\nWe calculated the loss in mean square error (MSE) between each feature. The loss was calculated for each note\nand each output features, except the tempo, whose loss was\ncalculated in beat level. During the training, the input sequences included all the notes that have non-matching performance notes, because missing notes in the input data\ncan change the context of the other notes in the score. However, these notes were excluded in the loss calculation because we could not extract performance features for the\nnotes. Since the articulation is largely affected by the sustain pedal, we reduced the weight for the articulation loss\nto 0.1 for notes with the sustain pedal pressed at the offset.\nProceedings of the 20th ISMIR Conference, Delft, Netherlands, November 4-8, 2019\n911\n\fModel\nTempo\nVel\nDev\nArtc\nPedal\nBaseline\n0.400\n0.673\n0.773\n0.721\n0.843\nHAN-S\n0.269\n0.607\n0.753\n0.688\n0.820\nHAN-M\n0.220\n0.532\n0.747\n0.754\n0.810\nTable 1.

To avoid that\nthe system bypasses z during the decoding, we use the\nKLD weight annealing as proposed in [1], so that the KLD\nweight started from zero at the beginning of training, and\nincreased to 0.02 gradually.\n4.2 Model Configuration\nThe score encoder of our proposed system has three-layer\ndense network of size 128 with ReLU activation as an embedding layer, two-layer bidirectional(Bi)-LSTMs of size\n128 for note-level and voice-level, two-layer Bi-LSTM of\nsize 64 for beat-level, and one-layer Bi-LSTM of size 64\nfor measure-level. The performance encoder has two-layer\nunidirectional(Uni)-LSTM of size 16 for note-level and\none-layer Uni-LSTM of size 16 for measure-level. The size\nof latent vector z in CVAE is 16. The performance decoder\nconsists of one-layer Uni-LSTMs for beat-level and notelevel both of size 64. The measure-level module has almost\nthe same setting except that every hidden size of the network in the performance encoder is 8 including the latent\nvector z.\nTo compare our approach with HAN architecture and\nmeasure-level modules (HAN-M), we also trained two\nother models. The first model is a baseline model that uses\nonly three-layers LSTM in note-level with hidden size of\n256. The other model, which will be denoted as HAN-S, is\na model that excludes the measure-level module. In HANS, the hidden size of beat-level layer in the score encoder\nand performance decoder was 128.\n5. RESULTS\n5.1 Reconstruction Error\nQuantitative evaluation of modeling expressive performance is a not trivial issue. One of the frequently used\nquantitative evaluation method is calculating MSE of output features [4]. Comparing the predicted outputs with\n\u201ctarget\u201d performance can be arbitrary, because there can be\nvarious ways to perform the score. In our system, however,\nthere is a performance encoder and a latent style vector z\nthat, ideally, makes the output in a style of the target performance. Therefore, comparing output features with the\ntarget performances is more reasonable. Also, as a learning model, it is fair to check the test loss with the same\ncriteria used for training.\nTable 1 shows the reconstruction loss of each model\non the test set which includes 21 pieces and 109 performances. The two HAN models achieved much less reconstruction error than the baseline model. This indicates that\nFigure 6. Average score of the listening test for Schubert\nSonata in 7-point Likert scale. The t-test results between\nour models (HAN-S,M) and Human are marked with ns\nonly if it is not significant. The results between our models\nand the others models are marked only if it is significant.\n\u201c*\u201d and \u201c**\u201d denote \u201cp\u22640.05\u201d and \u201cp\u22640.01\u201d, respectively.\nthe hierarchical approach helps the model to generalize to\nunseen data. Between the two HAN models, HAN-M is\nslightly better than HAN-S. We have tested different parameter sizes for HAN-S so that HAN-S has a similar number of parameters with the sum of two modules in HAN-M,\nbut the result was not much different.\n5.2 Listening Test\nWe also conducted a listening test to evaluate our model\nqualitatively. We asked five students, who are majoring piano at a college of music, to listen to the rendered performances and evaluate them with criteria presented in Figure\n6 in 7-point Likert scale (1 - very bad, 7 - very good) with\nadditional comments on the performance. We chose three\npieces of different styles from our test set: the first movement from Beethoven\u2019s Piano Sonata No. 5 (cut before recapitulation), Chopin\u2019s Etude op. 10 No. 2 (entire piece),\nand the first movement from Schubert Piano Sonata D.664\n(cut before development).\nWe prepared five different performances MIDI per\npiece: a human performance from Yamaha e-competition,\na direct export from MusicXML score to MIDI by a notation program (MuseScore), each of rendered performances\nfrom HAN-S and HAN-M, and Basis Mixer (BM). The\nresult exported from MuseScore had no tempo change but\nthe velocities of notes were changed by a simple rule-based\nconversion of dynamic markings in the score. BM is the\nonly publicly available model that does not require additional notation among previous expressive performance\nmodels [5]. It also achieved a highest score among other\ncomputational methods in previous research [26]. We included the BM model in the listening test and generated\nperformances with the same MusicXML file we used for\nour model 3 . Since the recording and playback in audio\nsystems can affect the quality of performance, we invited\nthe participants to our studio and played the prepared MIDI\nfiles with a Yamaha Disklavier piano. Each performance\nwas played once in a random order.\nThe result of evaluation on Schubert is presented in Figure 6 As expected, all participants gave highest scores in\n3 https://basismixer.cp.jku.at/static/app.html\nProceedings of the 20th ISMIR Conference, Delft, Netherlands, November 4-8, 2019\n912\n\fevery criteria for the human performance. Our proposed\nmodel, HAN-S and HAN-M, achieved higher scores in all\nseven criteria compared to other models. Two among five\nparticipants gave more than five out of seven points as the\nhuman confidence for the performance by HAN-S, and one\ngave five points to HAN-M. The t-test result showed that\nHAN-S and HAN-M showed statistically significant differences (p \u22640.05) compared to the score and the BM model\nin overall ratings of the performance of Schubert.\nThe positive comments on our models were: \u201cthe interpretation was interesting\u201d (Beethoven, HAN-M), \u201cfelt that\nthe flow of performance was humane\" (Beethoven, HANS), \u201cvoicing was too good so that it felt like performed\nby multiple performers\u201d (Chopin, HAN-S), \u201csounded\nlike a performance by human with strong characteristics\u201d (Chopin, HAN-S), \u201cvoicing was fine except some\nfaults\u201d (Schubert, HAN-M), and \u201csounded like machinegenerated performance with fine pedaling\u201d (Schubert,\nHAN-S) .\nThere were also negative comments criticizing our\nmodels, such as \u201cused too much pedal\u201d, \u201cpedal points\nwere unnatural\u201d, \u201clack of color\u201d, \u201ctoo short articulation\u201d,\n\u201csome tempo or dynamic changes were unnatural\u201d, \u201ctouch\nwas too light\u201d, and \u201cit did not seem that the performer\nwas listening to the performance\u201d. Although our models\nhad predicted the pedal usage, the pedaling was often too\ndeep and \u201cdirty\u201d or too shallow. The result showed that the\nnote-level pedal embedding needs improvement.\nThe responses of our participants for performances by\nBM, which is a data-driven model based on RNN, were\nnegative regardless of the piece. The comments from the\nparticipants said that \u201calthough there was a clear intention to express phrasing, it was unnatural and sounded like\na mechanical interpretation\u201d (Schubert), \u201cinaccurate and\nlimping rhythm\u201d (Beethoven and Schubert),and \u201cthe temporal gaps at measure boundary were unnatural\u201d (Chopin\nand Schubert). Unlike the Score MIDI, the performance by\nBM included clear change in tempo for phrasing. However,\nmost of the participants gave almost the same level of negative response to its phrasing quality compared to the Score\nMIDI. This shows how difficult it is to model phrasing of\nthe music.\nThe results were also largely differed by the characteristics of the piece. For example, Schubert\u2019s Sonata has a\nsong-like melody with arpeggio accompaniments. Hence,\nit was important to model the natural phrasing, e.g., subtle\nchange of tempo and velocity according to the melody. On\nthe other hand, the fast chromatic scale in Chopin\u2019s Etude\ndemands a stable tempo. Therefore, Score MIDI received\nsix out of seven points for overall quality from three participants because the performance was in perfectly constant\ntempo with strict following of dynamic markings. The flexibility of tempo generated by our model was not favored by\nthe participants in case of Chopin\u2019s Etude.\nIn summary, the results of listening test shows that our\nmodels have achieved more natural expressions compared\nto the other models, especially in a piece with song-like\nmelodies. Modeling the pedal usage and a human-like sta-\nFigure 7. a) Local tempo changes and b) Dynamics change\nin different performances of Schubert\u2019s Piano Sonata\nble tempo are issues to further investigate.\n5.3 Case Study: Comparison in Tempo and Dynamics\nThe quality of phrasing can be also observed from examples. Figure 7-a) compares local tempo changes in difference performances of Schubert\u2019s Sonata. The local tempo\nis represented with inter-onset-interval (IOI) which is computed by dividing seconds into quarter-note. BM has an evident peak at around the 10th note, which was exaggerated\nthan any other human pianists. In terms of Pearson correlation, HAN-S and HAN-M have a strong positive correlation with the pianists (0.7<r<1.0) while the BM model has\na less positive correlation (0.3<r<0.5).\nFigure 7-b) compares dynamics changes of melody\nnotes in different performances of the same piece. The dynamics is represented with MIDI note velocity. Increasing\nand decreasing timings of HAN-M and HAN-S are generally similar to pianists. For example, decrescendo starts at\nnote sequence 40 which follows crescendo, then pp starts\nat 45 and comes back to mf at 48. Both HAN-M and HANS show similar downward and upward curves with pianists\nwhile the BM model shows just slight upward curve. These\ntrend can be proved by correlation coefficients among pianists and generated models. HAN-S and HAN-M have\nsignificant positive correlation with pianists (0.3<r<0.7)\nwhile BM has almost no correlation (r<0.1).\n6.

Bardo Composer then uses Stochastic BiObjective Beam Search, a variant of Stochastic Beam Search\nthat we introduce in this paper, with a neural model to generate musical pieces conveying the desired emotion. We performed a user study with 116 participants to evaluate whether\npeople are able to correctly identify the emotion conveyed\nin the pieces generated by the system. In our study we used\npieces generated for Call of the Wild, a Dungeons and Dragons campaign available on YouTube. Our results show that\nhuman subjects could correctly identify the emotion of the\ngenerated music pieces as accurately as they were able to\nidentify the emotion of pieces written by humans.\nIntroduction\nIn this paper we introduce Bardo Composer, or Composer\nfor short, a system for generating musical pieces that match\nthe emotion of stories told in tabletop role-playing games\n(TRPGs). For example, if the players are fighting a dragon,\nComposer should generate a piece matching such an epic\nmoment of the story. TRPG players often manually choose\nsongs to play as background music to enhance their experience (Bergstr\u00a8om and Bj\u00a8ork 2014). Our goal is to develop\nan intelligent system that augments the players\u2019 experience\nwith soundtracks that match the story being told in the game.\nImportantly, the system should allow players to concentrate\non the role-playing part of the game, and not on the disruptive task of selecting the next music piece to be played.\nThe object of our research is Dungeons and Dragons (D&D),\na TRPG where players interpret characters of a story conducted by a special player called the dungeon master.\nPadovani, Ferreira, and Lelis (2017; 2019) introduced\nBardo, a system that automatically selects the background\nmusic of a D&D session based on the story being told by\nthe players. This paper builds upon their system. Bardo uses\na speech recognition system to transcribe voice into text,\nCopyright c\u20dd 2020, Association for the Advancement of Artificial\nIntelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\nwhich is then classified into an emotion. Bardo then selects\na song of the classified emotion from a library of labeled\nsongs. In this work we extend Bardo to include a neural\nmodel for generating musical pieces conveying the emotions\ndetected in the game story, instead of selecting a song from a\nlabeled library\u2014thus the name Bardo Composer. We expect\nthat by generating pieces we can capture the exact emotional\ntone of the story, while methods that select from a set of precomposed pieces have a more limited \u201cemotional palette\u201d.\nLanguage models (LMs) are able to generate coherent\nmusic pieces (Ferreira and Whitehead 2019). However, it\nis still challenging to generate music with a given emotion. For that we introduce Stochastic Bi-Objective Beam\nSearch (SBBS), a variant of Stochastic Beam Search (Poole\nand Mackworth 2010) to guide the generative process while\nmaximizing the probability given by a LM jointly with the\nprobability of pieces matching an emotion. The emotion in\nthe story is detected by a BERT model (Devlin et al. 2018)\nand is given as input to SBBS, which uses a GPT-2 model\n(Radford et al. 2019) to classify the emotion of the generated pieces.\nWe evaluated Composer on the Call of the Wild (CotW)\ndataset (Padovani, Ferreira, and Lelis 2017), which is a campaign of D&D available on YouTube. Since our primary goal\nis to generate music pieces conveying the current emotion\nof the game\u2019s story, we used Composer to generate pieces of\nparts of CotW that featured a transition in the story\u2019s emotion. Then, in a user study with 116 participants, we evaluated whether people correctly perceive the intended emotions in pieces generated by Composer. We also measured\nif the participants were able to distinguish the emotion of\nhuman-composed pieces by using Bardo\u2019s original system as\na baseline. Our results show that the participants were able\nto identify the emotions in generated pieces as accurately\nas they were able to identify emotions in human-composed\npieces. This is an important result towards the goal of a fullyautomated music composition system for TRPGs.\nRelated Work\nOur work is mostly related to machine learning models that\ngenerate music with a given emotion. For example, Monteith, Martinez, and Ventura (2010) trained Hidden Markov\narXiv:2008.07009v1  [cs.SD]  16 Aug 2020\n\fmodels to generate music from a corpus labeled according\nto a categorical model of emotion. These models are trained\nfor each emotion to generate melodies and underlying harmonies. Ferreira and Whitehead (2019) used a genetic algorithm to fine-tune a pre-trained LSTM, controlling the\nLSTM to generate either positive or negative pieces. Our\nwork differs from Monteith, Martinez, and Ventura\u2019s because we train a single LM that is controlled to generate music with different emotions. It is also different from (Ferreira\nand Whitehead 2019) once we control the LM at sampling\ntime and not at training time.\nOur work is also related to rule-based systems that map\nmusical features to a given emotion (Williams et al. 2015b).\nFor example, Williams et al. (2015a) generate soundtracks\nfor video games using a rule-based system to transform\npre-generated melodies, matching the emotion of annotated\ngame scenes. Davis and Mohammad (2014) follow a similar approach in TransPose, a system that generates piano\nmelodies for novels. Our work differs from these rule-based\nsystems because we learn mappings from musical features\nto emotion directly from data.\nOur work is also related to neural models that generate\ntext with a given characteristic. For example, CTRL (Keskar\net al. 2019) is a Transformer LM trained to generate text\nconditioned on special tokens that inform the LM about the\ncharacteristics of the text to be generated (e.g., style). Our\nwork differs from CTRL because we control the LM with a\nsearch procedure and not with an extra input to the LM. Conditioning the LM requires a large amount of labeled data,\nwhich is expensive in our domain.\nThe Plug and Play LM (Dathathri et al. 2019) combines a\npre-trained LM with a small attribute classifier to guide text\ngeneration. Although both Composer and the Plug and Play\nLM control the generation procedure at sampling time, we\nuse search as a means of generation control while Plug and\nPlay LM uses a classifier to alter the structure of the model.\nVijayakumar\net\nal.\n(2018)\nand\nKool,\nHoof,\nand\nWelling (2019) proposed variations of Beam search to solve\nthe problem of generating repetitive sentences. Our work\ndiffers from both these works because our variation of Beam\nsearch optimizes for two independent objectives.\nBackground\nSymbolic Music Composition Symbolic music is typically\ngenerated by sampling from a LM that computes the likelihood of the next musical symbols (e.g., note) in a piece.\nTypically, the LM is defined as a neural network and the\nsymbols are extracted from MIDI or piano roll representations of music (Briot, Hadjeres, and Pachet 2017). Let\nx = [x0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , xt\u22122, xt\u22121] be the first t symbols of a piece\nand P(xt|x0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , xt\u22122, xt\u22121) be the probability of the next\nsymbol being xt, according to a trained LM. One can sample\nthe next symbol of the sequence according to the probability\ndistribution P (Briot, Hadjeres, and Pachet 2017). We denote the trained language model as L and L(x) is a function\nthat returns the next symbol given a sequence x. To generate\na piece with L, one provides as input a sequence of symbols\nx = [x0, x1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , xt] to bias the generation process.

Bardo classifies sentences produced by a speech\nrecognition system into one of the four story emotions:\nHappy, Calm, Agitated, and Suspenseful. Bardo then selects\na song from a library of songs corresponding to the classified\nemotion. The selected song is then played as background\nmusic at the game table. In this paper we use Padovani et\nal.\u2019s dataset to train an emotion classifier for the story being\ntold at a game session. Their dataset includes 9 episodes of\nCotW, which contains 5,892 sentences and 45,247 words, resulting in 4 hours, 39 minutes, and 24 seconds of gameplay.\nThere are 2,005 Agitated, 2,493 Suspenseful, 38 Happy, and\n1,356 Calm sentences in the dataset.\nValence-Arousal Model of Emotion We use a twodimensional emotion model that generalizes the emotion\nmodel used in Bardo. We consider the dimensions of valence\nand arousal, denoted by a pair (v, a), where v \u2208 [0, 1] and\na \u2208 [0, 1] (Russell 1980). Valence measures sentiment and\nthus v = 0 means a negative input and v = 1 means a positive input. Arousal measures the energy of the input and thus\na = 0 means that the input has low energy whereas a = 1\nmeans that the input has high energy. We use this model for\nclassifying both the emotion of the player\u2019s speeches and the\nemotion of the generated music.\nBardo Composer: System Description\nA general overview of Composer is shown in Algorithm 1.\nIt receives as input a speech recognition system S, an emotion classifier for text Es, an emotion classifier for music\nEm, a LM for symbolic music generation L, a speech signal v with the last sentences spoken by the players, and a\nsequence x of musical symbols composed in previous calls\nto Composer. The algorithm also receives parameters b and\nk, which are used in the search procedure described in Algorithm 2. Composer returns a symbolic piece that tries to\nmatch the emotion in the players\u2019 speeches.\nComposer starts by converting the speech signal v into\ntext s with S (line 1). In addition to text, S returns the duration of the signal v in seconds, this is stored in l. Then,\nComposer classifies the emotion of s in terms of valence\n\fv and arousal a and it invokes our Stochastic Bi-Objective\nBeam Search (SBBS) to generate a sequence of symbols y\nthat matches the desired length l and emotion with arousal a\nand valence v. SBBS receives as input the models L and Em,\nthe current sequence x, the desired emotion values v and a,\nSBBS\u2019s parameter values b and k, which are explained below, and the desired length l of the piece to be generated.\nIn the first call to Composer, the sequence x is initialized\nwith the the symbols of the first 4 timesteps of a random\nhuman-composed piece with the emotion v, a, as returned\nby Es. Every time there is a transition from one emotion\nto another, we reinitialize the sequence x using the same\nprocess. This is used to bias the generative process and to\nemphasize emotion transitions.\nTo be used in real-time, Composer is invoked with the\nmost recently captured speech signal v and returns a composed piece of music. While the most recent piece is being\nplayed at the game table, Composer receives another signal\nv and composes the next excerpt. One also needs to define\nthe length of the signal v. In our implementation, similar to\nPadovani et al. (2017), we use YouTube\u2019s subtitle system as\nthe speech recognition system S. Therefore, signals v are\nlong enough to form a subtitle.\nClassifying the Story\u2019s Emotion\nIn order to have a common model of emotion between stories and music, we use a mapping from Bardo\u2019s four emotion\nmodel to the valence-arousal model. Namely, we have Suspenseful mapping to low valence and arousal (v = 0, a =\n0); Agitated to low valence and high arousal (v = 0, a = 1);\nCalm to high valence and low arousal (v = 1, a = 0); and\nHappy to high valence and arousal (v = 1, a = 1).\nFor example, in the context of the game Dungeons and\nDragons, the sentence \u201cRoll initiative\u201d is normally said at\nthe beginning of battles and it can be considered (v = 0, a =\n1), once a battle is a negative (dangerous) moment with high\nenergy. \u201cRoll initiative\u201d is normally classified as Agitated in\nPadovani et al.\u2019s dataset. This mapping allows us to use the\nvalence-arousal model with the labeled CotW dataset.\nThe valence-arousal mapping is based on the model used\nto annotate the VGMIDI dataset. When human subjects annotated that dataset, they used a continuous valence/arousal\nmodel with labels defining a fixed set of discrete basic emotions (e.g. happy or sad) (Ferreira and Whitehead 2019).\nGiven the limited amount of TRPG stories labeled according to emotion (there are only 5,892 sentences in the\nCotW dataset), we use a transfer learning approach to classify the sentences (Radford et al. 2018). We fine-tune a highcapacity BERT architecture with the CotW dataset (Devlin\net al. 2018). We use BERT because it outperforms several\nother transformers across different NLP tasks (Devlin et al.\n2018). Although in Algorithm 1 we depict the classifier for\nstory emotions as a single Es model, in our implementation\nwe treat valence and arousal independently, thus we finetune a pre-trained BERT for each dimension.\nClassifying the Music\u2019s Emotion\nAs was the case with the TRPG stories, given the limited\namount of MIDI pieces labeled according to emotion, we\nalso apply a transfer learning approach to classify emotion\nin music (Em). However, different than the Es model where\nwe fine-tune a BERT architecture, for Em we fine-tune a\nGPT-2 architecture (Radford et al. 2019). We use GPT-2\nfor Em because it is better suited for sequence generation\nthan BERT. Similarly to Es, model Em also treats valence\nand arousal independently. Thus, we fine-tune a pre-trained\nGPT-2 for each of these dimensions.\nTo the best of our knowledge, in the symbolic music domain, there are no publicly available high-capacity LM pretrained with large (general) datasets. Typically, models in\nthis domain are trained with relatively small and specific\ndatasets. For example, the MAESTRO dataset (Hawthorne\net al. 2019), the Bach Chorales (Hadjeres, Pachet, and\nNielsen 2017) and the VGMIDI (Ferreira and Whitehead\n2019) dataset. We pre-train a general high-capacity GPT-2\narchitecture as a language model (Radford et al. 2019) using a new dataset we created called ADL (Augmented Design Lab) Piano MIDI dataset 1.\nThe ADL Piano MIDI dataset is based on the Lakh MIDI\ndataset (Raffel 2016), which, to the best of our knowledge,\nis the largest MIDI dataset publicly available. The Lakh\nMIDI dataset contains a collection of 45,129 unique MIDI\nfiles that have been matched to entries in the Million Song\ndataset (Bertin-Mahieux et al. 2011). Among these files,\nthere are many versions of the same piece. We kept only\none version of each piece. Given that the datasets for emotion classification in music are limited to piano only, we extracted from the Lakh MIDI dataset only the tracks with instruments from the \u201cpiano family\u201d(MIDI program numbers\n1-8 in the dataset). This process generated a total of 9,021\nunique piano MIDI files. These files are mainly Rock and\nClassical pieces, so to increase the genre diversity (e.g. Jazz,\nBlues, and Latin) of the dataset, we included an additional\n2,065 files scraped from public sources on the Internet2. All\nfiles in the final collection were de-duped according to their\nMD5 checksum. The final dataset has 11,086 pieces.\nAfter pre-training the high-capacity GPT-2 model, we\nfine-tune two independent models (one for valence and\none for arousal) with an extended version of the VGMIDI\ndataset (Ferreira and Whitehead 2019). We extended the\nVGMIDI dataset from 95 to 200 labeled pieces using the\nsame annotation method of the original dataset. All the 200\npieces are piano arrangements of video game soundtracks\nlabeled according to the valence-arousal model of emotion.\nEncoding\nWe encode a MIDI file by parsing all notes from\nthe NOTE ON and NOTE OFF events in the MIDI. We define\na note as a set z = (zp, zs, zd, zv), where {zp \u2208 Z|0 \u2264\nzp < 128} is the pitch number, {zs \u2208 Z|zs \u2265 0} is the note\nstarting time in timesteps, {zd \u2208 Z|0 \u2264 zd \u2264 56} is note\nduration in timesteps and {zv \u2208 Z|0 \u2264 zv < 128} is the\nnote velocity. Given a MIDI NOTE ON event, we parse a note\nz by retrieving the starting time zs (in seconds), the pitch\nnumber zp and the velocity zv from that event. To calculate\nthe note duration zd, we find the correspondent NOTE OFF\nevent of the given NOTE ON and retrieve the NOTE OFF end\n1https://github.com/lucasnfe/adl-piano-midi\n2https://bushgrafts.com/midi/ and http://midkar.com/jazz/\n\fAlgorithm 2 Stochastic Bi-Objective Beam Search\nRequire: Music emotion classifier Em, LM L, previously\ncomposed symbols x, valence and arousal values v and\na, number k of symbols to consider, beam size b, length\nl in seconds of the generated piece.\nEnsure: Sequence of symbols of l seconds.\n1: B \u2190 [x], j \u2190 0\n2: while l(y[t : t + j]) < l, \u2200y \u2208 B do\n3:\nC \u2190 {}\n4:\nfor all m \u2208 B do\n5:\nCm \u2190 {m \u222a s|s \u2208 V }\n6:\nCm \u2190 k elements y from Cm with largest pL(y)\n7:\nC \u2190 C \u222a Ci\n8:\nB \u2190 b sequences y sampled from C proportionally\nto pL(y)(1 \u2212 |v \u2212 Em,v(y)|)(1 \u2212 |a \u2212 Em,a(y)|)\n9:\nj \u2190 j + 1\n10: return m \u2208 B such that pL(m) = maxy\u2208B pL(y) and\nl(y[t : t + j]) \u2265 l\ntime ze (in seconds). We discretize zs and ze to compute the\nnote duration zd = t \u00b7 ze \u2212 t \u00b7 zs in timesteps, where t is a\nparameter defining the sampling frequency of the timesteps.\nWe derive a sequence x = {z1\nv, z1\nd, z1\np, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , zn\nv , zn\nd , zn\np } of\ntokens for a given MIDI file by (a) parsing all notes zi from\nthe file, (b) sorting them by starting time zj\ns and (c) concatenating their velocity zj\nv, duration zj\nd and pitch zj\np. We add\ntwo special tokens TS and END in the sequence x, to mark\nthe end of a timestep and the end of a piece, respectively.\nThis encoding yields a vocabulary V of size |V | = 314.\nStochastic Bi-Objective Beam Search\nNext, we describe how one can use a LM and a music emotion classifier to bias the process of music generation to\nmatch a particular emotion (line 3 of Algorithm 1). For that\nwe introduce Stochastic Bi-Objective Beam Search (SBBS),\na search algorithm guided by the LM L and the music emotion classifiers, denoted as Em,v and Em,a, for valence and\narousal. The goal of SBBS is to allow for the generation of\npieces that sound \u201cgood\u201d (i.e., have high probability value\naccording to the trained LM), but that also match the current\nemotion of the story being told by the players.\nWe call SBBS \u201cstochastic\u201d because it samples from a distribution instead of greedily selecting the best sequences of\nsymbols, as a regular beam search does. The stochasticity of\nSBBS allows it to generate a large variety of musical pieces\nfor the same values of v and a. We also call it \u201cbi-objective\u201d\nbecause it optimizes for realism and emotion.\nThe pseudocode of SBBS is shown in Algorithm 2.\nIn the pseudocode we use letters x, y and m to denote sequences of musical symbols. Function pL(y) =\n\ufffd\nyt\u2208y P(yt|y0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , yt\u22121) is the probability of sequence y\naccording to the LM L; a high value of pL(y) means that y\nis recognized as a piece of \u201cgood quality\u201d by L. We denote\nas l(y) the duration in seconds of piece y. Finally, we write\nx[i : j] for j \u2265 i to denote the subsequence of x starting at\nindex i and finishing at index j.\nSBBS initializes the beam structure B with the sequence\nx passed as input (line 1). SBBS also initializes variable j\nfor counting the number of symbols added by the search.\nSBBS keeps in memory at most b sequences and, while all\nsequences are shorter than the desired duration l (line 2),\nit adds a symbol to each sequence (lines 3\u20139). SBBS then\ngenerates all sequences by adding one symbol from vocabulary V to each sequence m from B (line 5); these extended\nsequences, known as the children of m, are stored in Cm.\nThe operations performed in lines 6 and 8 attempt to ensure the generation of good pieces that convey the desired\nemotion. In line 6, SBBS selects the k sequences with largest\npL-value among the children of m. This is because some of\nthe children with low pL-value could be attractive from the\nperspective of the desired emotion and, although the resulting piece could convey the desired emotion, the piece would\nbe of low quality according to the LM. The best k children of\neach sequence in the beam are added to set C (line 7). Then,\nin line 8, SBBS samples the sequences that will form the\nbeam of the next iteration. Sampling occurs proportionally\nto the values of pL(y)(1\u2212|v\u2212Em,v(y)|)(1\u2212|a\u2212Em,a(y)|),\nfor sequences y in C. A sequence y has higher chance of being selected if L attributes a high probability value to y and\nif the music emotion model classifies the values of valence\nand arousal of y to be similar to the desired emotion. When\nat least one of the sequences is longer than the desired duration of the piece, SBBS returns the sequence with largest\npL-value that satisfies the duration constraint (line 10).\nEmpirical Evaluation\nOur empirical evaluation is divided into two parts. First, we\nevaluate the accuracy of the models used for story and music\nemotion classification. We are interested in comparing the\nfine-tuned BERT model for story emotion classification with\nthe simpler Na\u00a8\u0131ve Bayes approach of Padovani, Ferreira, and\nLelis (2017). We are also interested in comparing the finetuned GPT-2 model for music emotion classification with\nthe simpler LSTM of Ferreira and Whitehead (2019). In the\nsecond part of our experiments we evaluate with a user study\nwhether human subjects can recognize different emotions in\npieces generated by Composer for the CotW campaign.\nEmotion Classifiers\nStory Emotion\nThe story emotion classifier we use with\nComposer is a pair of BERT models, one for valence and\none for arousal. For both models, we use the pre-trained\nBERTBASE of Devlin et al. (2018), which has 12 layers,\n768 units per layer, and 12 attention heads. BERTBASE was\npre-trained using both the BooksCorpus (800M words) (Zhu\net al. 2015) and the English Wikipedia (2,500M words).\nWe independently fine-tune these two BERT models\nas valence and arousal classifiers using the CotW dataset\n(Padovani, Ferreira, and Lelis 2017). Fine-tuning consists\nof adding a classification head on top the pre-trained model\nand training all the parameters (including the pre-trained\nones) of the resulting model end-to-end. All these parameters were fine-tuned with an Adam optimizer (Kingma and\nBa 2014) with learning rate of 3e-5 for 10 epochs. We used\nmini-batches of size 32 and dropout of 0.5.\n\fAlg.\nEpisodes\nAvg.\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\nNB\n73 88 91 85 94 81 41 74 94\n80\nBERT\n89 92 96 88 97 81 66 83 96\n87\nTable 1: Valence accuracy in % of Na\u00a8\u0131ve Bayes (NB) and\nBERT for story emotion classification.\nThe CotW dataset is divided into 9 episodes, thus we evaluate the accuracy of each BERT classifier using a leave-oneout strategy. For each episode e, we leave e out for testing\nand train in the remaining episodes. For example, when testing on episode 1, we use episodes 2-8 for training. Every\nsentence is encoded using a WordPiece embedding (Wu et\nal. 2016) with a 30,000 token vocabulary.\nWe compare the fine-tuned BERT classifiers with a Na\u00a8\u0131ve\nBayes (NB) approach (baseline), chosen because it is the\nmethod underlying the original Bardo system. NB encodes\nsequences using a traditional bag-of-words with tfidf approach. Table 1 shows the accuracy of the valence classification of both these methods per episode. The best accuracy\nfor a given episode is highlighted in bold. The BERT classifier outperforms NB in all the episodes, having an average\naccuracy 7% higher. For valence classification, the hardest\nepisode for both the models is episode 7, where BERT had\nthe best performance improvement when compared to NB.\nThe story told in episode 7 of CotW is different from all\nother episodes. While the other episodes are full of battles\nand ability checks, episode 7 is mostly the players talking\nwith non-player characters. Therefore, what is learned in the\nother episodes does not generalize well to episode 7. The improvement in accuracy of the BERT model in that episode\nis likely due to the model\u2019s pre-training. Episodes 5 and 9\nwere equally easy for both methods because they are similar to one another. The system trained in one of these two\nepisodes generalizes well to the other.\nTable 2 shows the accuracy of arousal classification of\nboth NB and BERT. The best accuracy for a given episode is\nhighlighted in bold. Again BERT outperforms NB in all the\nepisodes, having an average accuracy 5% higher. In contrast\nwith the valence results, here there is no episode in which\nthe BERT model substantially outperforms NB.\nAlg.\nEpisodes\nAvg.\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\nNB\n82 88 75 79 82 76 98 86 84\n83\nBERT\n86 90 77 86 89 88 99 90 88\n88\nTable 2: Arousal accuracy in % of Na\u00a8\u0131ve Bayes (NB) and\nBERT for story emotion classification.\nMusic Emotion\nThe music emotion classifier is a pair of\nGPT-2 models, one for valence and one for arousal. We first\npre-trained a GPT-2 LM with our ADL Piano MIDI dataset.\nWe augmented each piece p of this dataset by (a) transpos-\nAlgorithm\nValence\nArousal\nBaseline LSTM\n69\n67\nFine-tuned LSTM\n74\n79\nBaseline GPT-2\n70\n76\nFine-tuned GPT-2\n80\n82\nTable 3: Accuracy in % of both the GPT-2 and LSTM models for music emotion classification.\ning p to every key, (b) increasing and decreasing p\u2019s tempo\nby 10% and (c) increasing and decreasing the velocity of\nall notes in p by 10% (Oore et al. 2017). Thus, each piece\ngenerated 12 \u00b7 3 \u00b7 3 = 108 different examples.\nThe pre-trained GPT-2 LM has 4 layers (transformer\nblocks), context size of 1024 tokens, 512 embedding units,\n1024 hidden units, and 8 attention heads. We then fine-tuned\nthe GPT-2 LM independently using the VGMIDI dataset,\nfor valence and for arousal. Similarly to BERT, fine-tuning\na GPT-2 architecture consists of adding an extra classification head on top of the pre-trained model and training all\nparameters end-to-end. Similar to the story emotion classifiers, we fine-tuned the GPT-2 classifiers for 10 epochs using\nan Adam optimizer with learning rate 3e-5. Different from\nthe story emotion classifiers, we used mini-batches of size\n16 (due to GPU memory constrains) and dropout of 0.25.\nThe VGMIDI dataset is defined with a train and test splits of\n160 and 40 pieces, respectively. We augmented the dataset\nby slicing each piece into 2, 4, 8 and 16 parts of equal length\nand emotion. Thus, each part of each slicing generated one\nextra example. This augmentation is intended to help the\nclassifier generalize for pieces with different lengths.\nWe compare the fine-tuned GPT-2 classifiers with LSTM\nmodels that were also pre-trained with the ADL Piano\nMidi dataset and fine-tuned with the VGMIDI dataset. We\nchose LSTMs because they are the state-of-the-art model in\nthe VGMIDI dataset (Ferreira and Whitehead 2019). The\nLSTMs have same size as the GPT-2 models (4 hidden\nlayers, 512 embedding units, 1024 hidden units) and were\npre-trained and fine-tuned with the same hyper-parameters.\nTable 3 shows the accuracy of both models for valence\nand arousal. We also report the performance of these models without pre-training (i.e., trained only on the VGMIDI\ndataset). We call these the baseline versions of the models.\nResults show that using transfer learning can substantially\nboost the performance of both models. The fine-tuned GPT2 is 10% more accurate in terms of valence and 8% in terms\nof arousal. The fine-tuned LSTM is 5% more accurate in\nterms of valence and 12% in terms of arousal. Finally, the\nfine-tuned GPT-2 outperformed the fine-tuned LSTM by 6%\nand 3% in terms of valence and arousal, respectively.\nUser Study\nIn our study we measure Composer\u2019s performance at generating music that matches the emotions of a story. We use\nComposer to generate a piece for a snippet composed of 8\ncontiguous sentences of each of the first 5 episodes of the\nCotW dataset. Each snippet has one emotion transition that\n\fMethod\nEpisodes\nAverage\ne1-p1\ne1-p2\ne2-p1\ne2-p2\ne3-p1\ne3-p2\ne4-p1\ne4-p2\ne5-p1\ne5-p2\nv\na\nv\na\nv\na\nv\na\nv\na\nv\na\nv\na\nv\na\nv\na\nv\na\nv\na\nva\nBaseline\n56\n65\n39 56 39 62 39\n79\n48\n60\n67\n53\n58 70\n63\n75 25\n36\n72\n58 51\n32\n34\nComposer\n62 60\n44 65 82 68 53\n68\n24\n55\n46\n43\n25 87\n37\n55 81\n86\n51\n67\n51 30\n34\nTable 4: The percentage of participants that correctly identified the valence and arousal (v and a, respectively) intended by the\nmethods for the pieces parts (p1 and p2).\nhappens in between sentences. The sentences are 5.18 seconds long on average. To test Composer\u2019s ability to generate\nmusic pieces with emotion changes, we asked human subjects to listen to the 5 generated pieces and evaluate the transitions of emotion in each generated piece.3\nThe user study was performed via Amazon Mechanical\nTurk and had an expected completion time of approximately\n10 minutes. A reward of USD $1 was given to each participant who completed the study. In the first section of the\nstudy, the participants were presented an illustrated description of the valence-arousal model of emotion and listened to\n4 examples of pieces from the VGMIDI dataset labeled with\nthe valence-arousal model. Each piece had a different emotion: low valence and arousal, low valence and high arousal,\nhigh valence and low arousal, high valence and arousal.\nIn the second section of the study, participants were asked\nto listen to the 5 generated pieces (one per episode). After\nlistening to each piece, participants had to answer 2 questions: (a) \u201cWhat emotion do you perceive in the 1st part of\nthe piece?\u201d and (b) \u201cWhat emotion do you perceive in the\n2nd part of the piece?\u201d To answer these two questions, participants selected one of the four emotions: low valence and\narousal, low valence and high arousal, high valence and low\narousal, high valence and arousal. Subjects were allowed to\nplay the pieces as many times as they wanted before answering the questions. The final section of the study was\na demographics questionnaire including ethnicity, first language, age, gender, and experience as a musician. To answer\nthe experience as a musician, we used a 1-to-5 Likert scale\nwhere 1 means \u201cI\u2019ve never studied music theory or practice\u201d\nand 5 means \u201cI have an undergraduate degree in music\u201d.\nWe compare Composer with a baseline method that selects a random piece from the VGMIDI dataset whenever\nthere is a transition of emotion. The selected piece has the\nsame emotion of the sentence (as given by the story emotion classifier). To compare these two methods, we used a\nbetween-subject strategy where Group A of 58 participants\nevaluated the 5 pieces generated by Composer and another\nGroup B of 58 participants evaluated the 5 pieces from the\nbaseline. We used this strategy to avoid possible learning\neffects where subjects could learn emotion transitions from\none method and apply the same evaluation directly to the\nother method. The average age of groups A and B are 34.96\nand 36.98 years, respectively. In Group A, 69.5% of participants are male and 30.5% are female. In Group B, 67.2%\n3Generated pieces can be downloaded from the following link:\nhttps://github.com/lucasnfe/bardo-composer\nare male and 32.8% are female. The average musicianship\nof the groups A and B are 2.77 and 2.46, respectively.\nTable 4 shows the results of the user study. We consider\nboth parts (p1 and p2 in the table) of each episode as an independent piece. The table presents the percentage of participants that correctly identified the pieces\u2019 valence and\narousal (\u201cv\u201d and \u201ca\u201d in the table, respectively), as intended\nby the methods. For example, 87% of the participants correctly identified the arousal value that Composer intended\nthe generated piece for part p1 of episode 4 (e4-p1) to have.\nWe refer to the percentage of participants that are able to\nidentify the approach\u2019s intended emotion as the approach\u2019s\naccuracy. We also present the approaches\u2019 average accuracy\nacross all pieces (\u201cAverage\u201d in the table) in terms of valence,\narousal, and jointly for valence and arousal (\u201cva\u201d in the table). The \u201cva\u201d-value of 34 for Composer means that 34%\nof the participants correctly identified the system\u2019s intended\nvalues for valence and arousal across all pieces generated.\nComposer outperformed the Baseline in e1-p2, e2-p1, and\ne5-p1. Baseline outperformed Composer e3-p1, e3-p2 and\ne4-p2. In the other four parts, one method performed better\nfor valence whereas the other method performance better for\narousal. Overall, the average results show that both systems\nperformed very similarly. Both of them had an average accuracy on the combined dimensions equal to 34%. The difference between these two methods and a system that selects\npieces at random (expected accuracy of 25%) is significant\naccording to a Binomial test (p = 0.02). These results show\nthat the participants were able to identify the emotions in the\ngenerated pieces as accurately as they were able to identify\nthe emotions in human-composed pieces. This is an important result towards the development of a fully automated system for music composition for story-based tabletop games.\nConclusions\nThis paper presented Bardo Composer, a system that automatically composes music for tabletop role-playing games.\nThe system processes sequences from speech and generates\npieces one sentence after the other. The emotion of the sentence is classified using a fine-tuned BERT. This emotion\nis given as input to a Stochastic Bi-Objective Beam Search\nalgorithm that tries to generate a piece that matches the emotion. We evaluated Composer with a user study and results\nshowed that human subjects correctly identified the emotion\nof the generated music pieces as accurately as they were able\nto identify the emotion of pieces composed by humans.\n\fReferences\n[Bergstr\u00a8om and Bj\u00a8ork 2014] Bergstr\u00a8om, K., and Bj\u00a8ork, S.\n2014.

We describe its creation\nprocess, its content, and its possible uses. Attractive features of the Million Song Database include the range of existing resources to which it is linked, and the fact that it is the\nlargest current research dataset in our field. As an illustration, we present year prediction as an example application,\na task that has, until now, been difficult to study owing to\nthe absence of a large set of suitable data. We show positive\nresults on year prediction, and discuss more generally the\nfuture development of the dataset.\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\u201cThere is no data like more data\u201d said Bob Mercer of IBM\nin 1985 [7], highlighting a problem common to many fields\nbased on statistical analysis. This problem is aggravated in\nMusic Information Retrieval (MIR) by the delicate question of licensing. Smaller datasets have ignored the issue\n(e.g. GZTAN [11]) while larger ones have resorted to solutions such as using songs released under Creative Commons\n(Magnatagatune [9]).\nThe Million Song Dataset (MSD) is our attempt to help\nresearchers by providing a large-scale dataset. The MSD\ncontains metadata and audio analysis for a million songs that\nwere legally available to The Echo Nest. The songs are representative of recent western commercial music. The main\npurposes of the dataset are:\n\u2022 to encourage research on algorithms that scale to commercial sizes;\n\u2022 to provide a reference dataset for evaluating research;\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the first page.\nc\u20dd 2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.\n\u2022 as a shortcut alternative to creating a large dataset\nwith The Echo Nest\u2019s API;\n\u2022 to help new researchers get started in the MIR field.\nSome have questioned the ability of conferences like ISMIR\nto transfer technologies into the commercial world, with\nscalability a common concern. Giving researchers a chance\nto apply their algorithms to a dataset of a million songs is a\nstep in the right direction.\n2. THE DATASET\n2.1 Why?\nThe idea for the Million Song Dataset arose a couple of\nyears ago while discussing ideas for a proposal to the US\nNational Science Foundation\u2019s GOALI (Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry) program. We wanted\nan idea that would not be possible without academic-industrial\ncollaboration, and that would appeal to the NSF as contributing to scientific progress.\nOne of the long-standing criticisms of academic music\ninformation research from our colleagues in the commercial\nsphere is that the ideas and techniques we develop are simply not practical for real services, which must offer hundreds\nof thousands of tracks at a minimum. But, as academics,\nhow can we develop scalable algorithms without the largescale datasets to try them on? The idea of a \u201cmillion song\ndataset\u201d started as a flippant suggestion of what it would\ntake to solve this problem. But the idea stuck \u2013 not only in\nthe form of developing a very large, common dataset, but\neven in the specific scale of one million tracks.\nThere are a several possible reasons why the community\ndoes not already have a dataset of this scale:\n\u2022 We all already have our favorite, personal datasets of\nhundreds or thousands of tracks, and to a large extent\nwe are happy with the results we get from them.\n\u2022 Collecting the actual music for a dataset of more than\na few hundred CDs (i.e. the kind of thing you can do\nby asking all your colleagues to lend you their collections) becomes something of a challenge.\n\f\u2022 The well-known antagonistic stance of the recording\nindustry to the digital sharing of their data seems to\ndoom any effort to share large music collections.\n\u2022 It is simply a lot of work to manage all the details for\nthis amount of data.\nOn the other hand, there are some obvious advantages to\ncreating a large dataset:\n\u2022 A large dataset helps reveal problems with algorithm\nscaling that may not be so obvious or pressing when\ntested on small sets, but which are critical to realworld deployment.\n\u2022 Certain kinds of relatively-rare phenomena or patterns\nmay not be discernable in small datasets, but may lead\nto exciting, novel discoveries from large collections.\n\u2022 A large dataset can be relatively comprehensive, encompassing various more specialized subsets. By having all subsets within a single universe, we can have\nstandardized data fields, features, etc.\n\u2022 A single, multipurpose, freely-available dataset greatly\npromotes direct comparisons and interchange of ideas\nand results.\nA quick look at other sources in Table 1 confirms that\nthere have been many attempts at providing larger and more\ndiverse datasets. The MSD stands out as the largest currently available for researchers.\ndataset\n# songs / samples\naudio\nRWC\n465\nYes\nCAL500\n502\nNo\nGZTAN genre\n1, 000\nYes\nUSPOP\n8, 752\nNo\nSwat10K\n10, 870\nNo\nMagnatagatune\n25, 863\nYes\nOMRAS2\n50, 000?\nNo\nMusiCLEF\n200, 000\nYes\nMSD\n1, 000, 000\nNo\nTable 1. Size comparison with some other datasets.\n2.2 Creation\nThe core of the dataset comes from The Echo Nest API [5].\nThis online resource provides metadata and audio analysis\nfor millions of tracks and powers many music applications\non the web, smart phones, etc. We had unlimited access to\nthe API and used the python wrapper pyechonest 1 . We cap-\n1 http://code.google.com/p/pyechonest/\ntured most of the information provided, ranging from timbre analysis on a short time-scale, to global artist similarity. From a practical point of view, it took us 5 threads running non-stop for 10 days to gather the dataset. All the code\nwe used is available, which would allow data on additional\ntracks to be gathered in the same format. Some additional\ninformation was derived from a local musicbrainz server [2].\n2.3 Content\nThe MSD contains audio features and metadata for a million\ncontemporary popular music tracks. It contains:\n\u2022 280 GB of data\n\u2022 1, 000, 000 songs/files\n\u2022 44, 745 unique artists\n\u2022 7, 643 unique terms (Echo Nest tags)\n\u2022 2, 321 unique musicbrainz tags\n\u2022 43, 943 artists with at least one term\n\u2022 2, 201, 916 asymmetric similarity relationships\n\u2022 515, 576 dated tracks starting from 1922\nThe data is stored using HDF5 format 2 to efficiently\nhandle the heterogeneous types of information such as audio features in variable array lengths, names as strings, longitude/latitude, similar artists, etc. Each song is described\nby a single file, whose contents are listed in Table 2.\nThe main acoustic features are pitches, timbre and loudness, as defined by the Echo Nest Analyze API. The API\nprovides these for every \u201csegment\u201d, which are generally delimited by note onsets, or other discontinuities in the signal. The API also estimates the tatums, beats, bars (usually\ngroups of 3 or 4 beats) and sections. Figure 1 shows beataligned timbre and pitch vectors, which both consist of 12\nelements per segment. Peak loudness is also shown.\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\ntimbre\n0\n6\n12\nBeat-aligned features for Wolfmother - Cosmonaut (sample)\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\npitches\n0\n6\n12\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\nloudness max\n-2\n-5\n-8\ndB\nFigure 1.

It\ncontains tutorials, code samples 3 , an FAQ, and the pointers\nto the actual data, generously hosted by Infochimps 4 .\n2.4 Links to other resources\nThe Echo Nest API can be used alongside the Million Song\nDataset since we provide all The Echo Nest identifiers (track,\nsong, album, artist) for each track. The API can give updated values for temporally-changing attributes (song hotttnesss, artist familiarity, ...) and also provides some data\nnot included in the MSD, such as links to album cover art,\nartist-provided audio urls (where available), etc.\nAnother very large dataset is the recently-released Yahoo Music Ratings Datasets 5 . Part of this links user ratings\nto 97, 954 artists; 15, 780 of these also appear in the MSD.\nFortunately, the overlap constitutes the more popular artists,\nand accounts for 91% of the ratings. The combination of the\ntwo datasets is, to our knowledge, the largest benchmark for\nevaluating content-based music recommendation.\nThe Echo Nest has partnered with 7digital 6 to provide\nthe 7digital identifier for all tracks in the MSD. A free 7dig-\n3 https://github.com/tb2332/MSongsDB\n4 http://www.infochimps.com/\n5 http://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/\n6 http://www.7digital.com\nital account lets you fetch 30 seconds samples of songs (up\nto some cap), which is enough for sanity checks, games, or\nuser experiments on tagging. It might be feasible to compute some additional audio features on these samples, but\nonly for a small portion of the dataset.\nTo support further linking to other sources of data, we\nprovide as many identifiers as available, including The Echo\nNest identifiers, the musicbrainz artist identifier, the 7digital and playme 7 identifiers, plus the artist, album and song\nnames. For instance, one can use MusiXmatch 8 to fetch\nlyrics for many of the songs. Their API takes Echo Nest\nidentifiers, and will also perform searches on artist and song\ntitle. We will return to musiXmatch in the next section.\n3. PROPOSED USAGE\nA wide range of MIR tasks could be performed or measured\non the MSD. Here, we give a somewhat random sample of\npossible uses based on the community\u2019s current interests,\nwhich serves to illustrate the breadth of data available in the\ndataset.\n3.1 Metadata analysis\nThe original intention of the dataset was to release a large\nvolume of audio features for machine learning algorithms.\nThat said, analyzing metadata from a million song is also\nextremely interesting. For instance, one could address questions like: Are all the \u201cgood\u201d artist names already taken?\nDo newer bands have to use longer names to be original?\nThis turns out to be false according to the MSD: The average length might even be reducing, although some recent\noutliers use uncommonly long names. The Figure 2 summarizes this. The least squared regression has parameters:\ngradient = \u22120.022 characters/year and intercept = 55.4 characters (the extrapolated length of a band name at year 0!).\n1920\n1940\n1960\n1980\n2000\n2020\nyear\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\nartist name length\nArtist name length per year\nartist name lengths\nleast squared regression\nFigure 2. Artist name length as a function of year.\n3.2 Artist recognition\nRecognizing the artist from the audio is a straightforward\ntask that provides a nice showcase of both audio features\nand machine learning. In the MSD, a reasonable target is\n7 http://www.playme.com\n8 http://www.musixmatch.com\n\fthe 18, 073 artists that have at least 20 songs in the dataset\n(in contrast to the 5 artists reported a decade ago in [12]).\nWe provide two standard training/test splits, the more difficult of which contains just 15 songs from each artist in the\ntraining set. This prevents the use of artist popularity. Our\nbenchmark k-NN algorithm has an accuracy of 4% (code\nprovided), which leaves plenty of room for improvement.\n3.3 Automatic music tagging\nAutomatic tagging [4] has been a core MIR tasks for the last\nfew years. The Echo Nest provides tags (called \u201cterms\u201d) at\nthe artist level, and we also retrieved the few terms provided\nby musicbrainz. A sample is shown in Table 3. We split all\nartists between train and test based on the 300 most popular\nterms from The Echo Nest. This makes it the largest available dataset for tagging evaluation, as compared to Magnatagatune [9], Swat10K [10] and the Last.FM corpus in [3].\nThat said, the MSD currently lacks any tags at the song,\nrather than the artist, level. We would welcome the contribution of such tags.\nAlthough less studied, the correlation between tags and\nmetadata could be of great interest in a commercial system. Certain \u201cgenre tags\u201d, such as \u201cdisco\u201d, usually apply\nto songs released in the 70s. There are also correlations between artist names and genres; you can probably guess the\nkind of music the band Disembowelment plays (if you are\nnot already a fan).\nartist\nEN terms\nmusicbrainz tags\nadult contemporary\nhard rock\nBon Jovi\narena rock\nglam metal\n80s\namerican\nteen pop\npop\nBritney Spears\nsoft rock\namerican\nfemale\ndance\nTable 3. Example of tags for two artists, as provided by The\nEcho Nest and musicbrainz.\n3.4 Recommendation\nMusic recommendation and music similarity are perhaps\nthe best-studied areas in MIR. One reason is the potential\ncommercial value of a working system. So far, contentbased system have fallen short at predicting user ratings\nwhen compared to collaborative filtering methods. One can\nargue that ratings are only one facet of recommendation\n(since listeners also value novelty and serendipity [6]), but\nthey are essential to a commercial system.\nThe Yahoo Music Ratings Datasets, mentioned above,\nopens the possibility of a large scale experiment on predicting ratings based on audio features with a clean ground\nRicky Martin\nWeezer\nEnrique Iglesias\nDeath Cab for Cutie\nChristina Aguilera\nThe Smashing Pumpkins\nShakira\nFoo Fighters\nJennifer Lopez\nGreen Day\nTable 4. Some similar artists according to The Echo Nest.\ntruth. This is unlikely to settle the debate on the merit of\ncontent-based music recommendation once and for all, but\nit should support the discussion with better numbers.\n3.5 Cover song recognition\nCover song recognition has generated many publications in\nthe past few years. One motivation behind this task is the\nbelief that finding covers relies on understanding something\ndeeper about the structure of a piece. We have partnered\nwith Second Hand Songs, a community-driven database of\ncover songs, to provide the SecondHandSong dataset 9 . It\ncontains 18, 196 cover songs grouped into 5, 854 works (or\ncliques). For comparison, the MIREX 2010 Cover Song\nevaluation used 869 queries. Since most of the work on\ncover recognition has used variants of the chroma features\nwhich are included in the MSD (pitches), it is now the largest\nevaluation set for this task.\n3.6 Lyrics\nIn partnership with musiXmatch (whose API was mentioned\nabove), we have released the musiXmatch dataset 10 , a collection of lyrics from 237, 662 tracks of the MSD. The lyrics\ncome in a bag-of-words format and are stemmed, partly for\ncopyright reasons. Through this dataset, the MSD links audio features, tags, artist similarity, etc., to lyrics.\nAs an\nexample, mood prediction from lyrics (a recently-popular\ntopic) could be investigated with this data.\n3.7 Limitations\nTo state the obvious, there are many tasks not suited for the\nMSD. Without access to the original audio, the scope for\nnovel acoustic representations is limited to those that can be\nderived from the Echo Nest features. Also, the dataset is\ncurrently lacking album and song-level metadata and tags.\nDiversity is another issue: there is little or no world, ethnic,\nand classical music.\n9 SecondHandSongs dataset, the official list of cover songs within\nthe Million Song Dataset,\navailable at:\nhttp://labrosa.ee.\ncolumbia.edu/millionsong/secondhand\n10 musiXmatch dataset, the official lyrics collection for the Million\nSong Dataset, available at: http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/\nmillionsong/musixmatch\n\fTasks that require very accurate time stamps can be problematic. Even if you have the audio for a song that appears\nin the MSD, there is little guarantee that the features will\nhave been computed on the same audio track.\nThis is a\ncommon problem when distributing audio features, originating from the numerous official releases of any given song as\nwell as the variety of ripping and encoding schemes in use.\nWe hope to address the problem in two ways. First, if you\nupload audio to The Echo Nest API, you will get a timeaccurate audio analysis that can be formatted to match the\nrest of the MSD (code provided). Secondly, we plan to provide a fingerprinter that can be use to resolve and align local\naudio with the MSD audio features.\n4. YEAR PREDICTION\nAs shown in the previous section, many tasks can be addressed using the MSD. We present year prediction as a case\nstudy for two reasons: (1) it has been little studied, and (2)\nit has practical applications in music recommendation.\nWe define year prediction as estimating the year in which\na song was released based on its audio features. (Although\nmetadata features such as artist name or similar artist tags\nwould certainly be informative, we leave this for future work).\nListeners often have particular affection for music from certain periods of their lives (such as high school), thus the\npredicted year could be a useful basis for recommendation.\nFurthermore, a successful model of the variation in music\naudio characteristics through the years could throw light on\nthe long-term evolution of popular music.\nIt is hard to find prior work specifically addressing year\nprediction. One reasons is surely the lack of a large music collection spanning both a wide range of genres (at least\nwithin western pop) and a long period of time. Note, however, that many music genres are more or less explicitly associated with specific years, so this problem is clearly related to genre recognition and automatic tagging [4].\n4.1 Data\nThe \u201cyear\u201d information was inferred by matching the MSD\nsongs against the musicbrainz database, which includes a\nyear-of-release field. This resulted in values for 515, 576\ntracks representing 28, 223 artists. Errors could creep into\nthis data from two main sources: incorrect matching, and\nincorrect information in musicbrainz. Informal inspection\nsuggests the data is mostly clean; instead, the main issue\nis the highly nonuniform distribution of data per year, as\nshown in Figure 3. A baseline, uniform prediction at the\nmode or mean year would give reasonable accuracy figures\nbecause of the narrow peak in the distribution around 2007.\nHowever, we have enough data to be able to show that even\nsmall improvements in average accuracy are statistically significant: With 2, 822 test artists and using a z-test with a\n95% confidence level, an improvement of 1.8 years is significant. Allowing some independence between the songs\nfrom a single artist reduces that number still more.\n25\n45\n65\n85\n05\n0\n5000\n10000\n15000\n20000\n25000\n30000\n35000\n40000\nnumber of songs per year\n25\n45\n65\n85\n05\n0\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\n2500\nnumber of artists per year\nFigure 3. Distribution of MSD tracks for which release year\nis available, from 1922 to 2011. An artist\u2019s \u201cyear\u201d value is\nthe average of their songs.\nAgain, we define and publish a split between train and\ntest artists so future results can be directly comparable. The\nsplit is among artists and not songs in order to avoid problems such as the \u201cproducer effect\u201d. The features we use are\nthe average and covariance of the timbre vectors for each\nsong. No further processing is performed. Using only the\nnonredundant values from the covariance matrix gives us a\nfeature vector of 90 elements per track.\n4.2 Methods\nOur first benchmark method is k nearest neighbors (k-NN),\nwhich is easy to parallelize and requires only a single pass\nover the training set, given enough memory. Prediction can\nefficiently performed thanks to libraries such as ANN 11 .\nThe predicted year of a test item is the average year of the k\nnearest training songs.\nA more powerful algorithm, specifically designed for largescale learning, is Vowpal Wabbit [8] (VW). It performs regression by learning a linear transformation w of the features x using gradient descent, so that the predicted value \u02c6yi\nfor item i is:\n\u02c6yi =\n\ufffd\nj\nwjxi\nj\nYear values are linearly mapped onto [0, 1] using 1922 as 0\nand 2011 as 1. Once the data is cached, VW can do many\npasses over the training set in a few minutes. VW has many\nparameters; we performed an exhaustive set of experiments\nusing a range of parameters on a validation set. We report\nresults using the best parameters from this search according\nto the average difference measure. The final model is trained\non the whole training set.\n4.3 Evaluation and results\nTable 5 presents both average absolute difference and square\nroot of the average squared difference between the predicted\nrelease year and the actual year.\n11 http://www.cs.umd.edu/\u02dcmount/ANN/\n\fmethod\ndiff\nsq. diff\nconstant pred.\n8.13\n10.80\n1-NN\n9.81\n13.99\n50-NN\n7.58\n10.20\nvw\n6.14\n8.76\nTable 5.

With VW 12 we can make a significant improvement on this baseline.\n5. THE FUTURE OF THE DATASET\nTime will tell how useful the MSD proves to be, but here\nare our thoughts regarding what will become of this data.\nWe have assemble a dataset which we designed to be comprehensive and detailed enough to support a very wide range\nof music information research tasks for at least the near future. Our hope is that the Million Song Dataset becomes\nthe natural choice for researchers wanting to try out ideas\nand algorithms on data that is standardized, easily obtained,\nand relevant to both academia and industry. If we succeed,\nour field can be greatly strengthened through the use of a\ncommon, relevant dataset.\nBut for this to come true, we need lots of people to use\nthe data. Naturally, we want our investment in developing\nthe MSD to have as much positive impact as possible. Although the effort so far has been limited to the authors, we\nhope that it will become a true community effort as more\nand more researchers start using and supporting the MSD.\nOur vision is of many different individuals and groups developing and contributing additional data, all referenced to\nthe same underlying dataset. Sharing this augmented data\nwill further improve its usefulness, while preserving as far\nas possible the commonality and comparability of a single\ncollection.\n5.1 Visibility for MIR\nThe MSD has good potential to enhance the visibility of the\nMIR community in the wider research world. There have\nbeen numerous discussions and comments on how our field\nseems to take more that it gives back from other areas such\nas machine learning and vision.

INTRODUCTION\nOrchestration is the subtle art of writing musical pieces for\nthe orchestra by combining the properties of various instruments in order to achieve a particular musical idea [11,23].\nAmong the variety of writing techniques for orchestra, we\ndefine as projective orchestration [8] the technique which\nconsists in first writing a piano score and then orchestrating\nit (akin to a projection operation, as depicted in Figure 1).\nThis technique has been used by classic composers for centuries. One such example is the orchestration by Maurice\nRavel of Pictures at an Exhibition, a piano work written by\nModest Mussorgsky. This paper introduces the first dataset\nof musical scores dedicated to projective orchestrations. It\ncontains pairs of piano pieces associated with their orchestration written by famous composers. Hence, the purpose\nof this database is to offer a solid knowledge for studying\nthe correlations involved in the transformation from a piano to an orchestral score.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.\nFirst, the motivations for a scientific investigation of orchestration are exposed (section 2).\nBy reviewing the\nprevious attempts, we highlight the specific need for a\nc\u20dd L\u00b4eopold Crestel, Philippe Esling, Lena Heng, Stephen\nMcAdams.

In an attempt to fill this gap, we built the Projective\nOrchestral Database (POD) and detail its structure in section 3. In section 4, the automatic projective orchestration\ntask is proposed as an evaluation framework for automatic\norchestration systems. We report our experiment with a\nset of learning-based models derived from the Restricted\nBoltzmann Machine [26] and introduce their performance\nin the previously defined evaluation framework. Finally, in\nsection 5 we provide methodological guidelines and conclusions.\n2. A SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION OF\nORCHESTRATION\nOver the past centuries, several treatises have been written\nby renowned composers in an attempt to decipher some\nguiding rules in orchestration [11, 21, 23]. Even though\nthey present a remarkable set of examples, none of them\nbuilds a systemic set of rules towards a comprehensive theory of orchestration. The reason behind this lack lies in\nthe tremendous complexity that emerges from orchestral\nworks. A large number of possible sounds can be created\nby combining the pitch and intensity ranges of each instru-\narXiv:1810.08611v1  [cs.SD]  19 Oct 2018\n\fments in a symphonic orchestra. Furthermore, during a\nperformance, the sound produced by a mixture of instruments is also the result of highly non-linear acoustic effects. Finally, the way we perceive those sounds involves\ncomplex psychoacoustic phenomena [14,16,25]. It seems\nalmost impossible for a human mind to grasp in its entirety\nthe intertwined mechanisms of an orchestral rendering.\nHence, we believe that a thorough scientific investigation could help disentangle the multiple factors involved in\norchestral works. This could provide a first step towards\na greater understanding of this complex and widely uncharted discipline. Recently, major works have refined our\nunderstanding of the perceptual and cognitive mechanisms\nspecifically involved when listening to instrumental mixtures [15, 22, 25]. Orchids, an advanced tool for assisting\ncomposers in the search of a particular sonic goal has been\ndeveloped [8]. It relies on the multi-objective optimization of several spectro-temporal features such as those described in [20].\nHowever, few attempts have been made to tackle a scientific exploration of orchestration based on the study of\nmusical scores. Yet, symbolic representations implicitly\nconvey high-level information about the spectral knowledge composers have exploited for timbre manipulations.\nIn [6] a generative system for orchestral music is introduced. Given a certain style, the system is able to generate\na melodic line and its accompaniment by a full symphonic\norchestra. Their approach relies on a set of templates and\nhand-designed rules characteristic of different styles. [19]\nis a case study of how to automatically transfer the Ode\nto joy to different styles. Unfortunately, very few details\nare provided about the models used, but it is interesting to\nobserve that different models are used for different styles.\nAutomatic arrangement, which consists in reducing an orchestral score to a piano version that is can be played by\na two-hand pianist, has been tackled in [10] and [24]. The\nproposed systems rely on an automatic analysis of the orchestral score in order to split it into structuring elements.\nThen, each element is assigned a role which determines\nwhether it is played or discarded in the reduction. To the\nbest of our knowledge, the inverse problem of automatically orchestrating a piano score has never been tackled.\nHowever, we believe that unknown mechanisms of orchestration could be revealed by observing how composers perform projective orchestration, which essentially consists in\nhighlighting an existing harmonic, rhythmic and melodic\nstructure of a piano piece through a timbral structure.\nEven though symbolic data are generally regarded as\na more compact representation than a raw signal in the\ncomputer music field, the number of pitch combinations\nthat a symphonic orchestra can produce is extremely large.\nHence, the manipulation of symbolic data still remains\ncostly from a computational point of view. Even through\ncomputer analysis, an exhaustive investigation of all the\npossible combinations is not feasible. For that reason, the\napproaches found in the literature rely heavily on heuristics\nand hand-designed rules to limit the number of possible\nsolutions and decrease the complexity. However, the re-\ncent advents in machine learning have brought techniques\nthat can cope with the dimensionality involved with symbolic orchestral data.\nBesides, even if a wide range of\norchestrations exist for a given piano score, all of them\nwill share strong relations with the original piano score.\nTherefore, we make the assumption that projective orchestration might be a relatively simple and well-structured\ntransformation lying in a complex high-dimensional space.\nNeural networks have precisely demonstrated a spectacular ability for extracting a structured lower-dimensional\nmanifold from a high-dimensional entangled representation [13]. Hence, we believe that statistical tools are now\npowerful enough to lead a scientific investigation of projective orchestration based on symbolic data.\nThese statistical methods require an extensive amount\nof data, but there is no symbolic database dedicated to orchestration. This dataset is a first attempt to fill this gap\nby building a freely accessible symbolic database of piano\nscores and corresponding orchestrations.\n3. DATASET\n3.1 Structure of the Database\nThe database can be found on the companion website 1\nof this article, along with statistics and Python code for\nreproducibility.\n3.1.1 Organization\nThe Projective Orchestral Database (POD) contains 392\nMIDI files. Those files are grouped in pairs containing a\npiano score and its orchestral version. Each pair is stored\nin a folder indexed by a number. The files have been collected from several free-access databases [1] or created by\nprofessional orchestration teachers.\n3.1.2 Instrumentation\nAs the files gathered in the database have various origins,\ndifferent instrument names were found under a variety of\naliases and abbreviations. Hence, we provide a commaseparated value (CSV) file associated with each MIDI file\nin order to normalize the corresponding instrumentations.\nIn these files, the track names of the MIDI files are linked\nto a normalized instrument name.\n3.1.3 Metadata\nFor each folder, a CSV file with the name of the folder\ncontains the relative path from the database root directory,\nthe composer name and the piece name for the orchestral and piano works. A list of the composers present in\nthe database can be found in table 1. It is important to\nnote the imbalanced representativeness of composers in the\ndatabase. It can be problematic in the learning context we\ninvestigate, because a kind of stylistic consistency is a priori necessary in order to extract a coherent set of rules.\nPicking a subset of the database would be one solution,\nbut another possibility would be to add to the database this\nstylistic information and use it in a learning system.\n1 https://qsdfo.github.io/LOP/database\n\fComposer\nNumber of\npiano files\nPercentage\npiano frames\nNumber of\norchestra files\nPercentage\norchestra frames\nArcadelt.

For each composer, the number of piano (respectively orchestral) scores\nin the database are indicated in the second (respectively\nfourth) column. The total number of files is 184 x 2 = 392.\nAs the length of the files can vary significantly, a more\nsignificant indicator of a composer\u2019s representativeness in\nthe database is the ratio of the number of frames from its\nscores over the total number of frames in the database.\nFigure 2 highlights the activation ratio of each pitch in\nthe orchestration scores (\n#{pitch on}\n#{pitch on}+#{pitch off}, where # is\nthe cardinal of an ensemble) over the whole dataset. Note\nthat this activation ratio does not take the duration of notes\ninto consideration, but only their number of occurrences.\nThe pitch range of each instrument can be observed beneath the horizontal axis.\nTwo different kinds of imbalance can be observed in\nfigure 2. First, a given pitch is rarely played. Second,\nsome pitches are played more often compared with others.\nClass imbalance is known as being problematic for machine learning systems, and these two observations highlight how challenging the projective orchestration task is.\nVln.

This value is computed for the event-level\naligned representations 4.2. The different instruments are\ncovered by the pitch axis, and one can observe the peaks\nthat their medium ranges form. The maximum value of the\nvertical axis (0.06), which is well below 1, indicates that\neach pitch is rarely played in the whole database.\nMore statistics about the whole database can be found on\nthe companion website.\n3.1.4 Integrity\nBoth the metadata and instrumentation CSV files have been\nautomatically generated but manually checked. We followed a conservative approach by automatically rejecting\nany score with the slightest ambiguity between a track\nname and a possible instrument (for instance bass can refer\nto double-bass or voice bass).\n3.1.5 Formats\nTo facilitate the research work, we provide pre-computed\npiano-roll representations such as the one displayed in\nFigure 3. In this case, all the MIDI files of piano (respectively orchestra) work have been transformed and concatenated into a unique two-dimensional matrix. The starting\nand ending time of each track is indicated in the metadata.pkl file. These matrices can be found in Lua/Torch\n(.t7), Matlab (.m), Python (.npy) and raw (.csv) data formats.\n3.1.6 Score Alignment\nTwo versions of the database are provided.\nThe first\nversion contains unmodified midi files.\nThe second\nversion contains MIDI files automatically aligned using the Needleman-Wunsch [18] algorithm as detailed in\n\fPitch\n&\n&\n&\n&\n?\n?\n?\nbb\nbb\nbb\nbb\nbb\nbb\nbb\n45\n45\n45\n45\n45\n45\n45\n46\n46\n46\n46\n46\n46\n46\n45\n45\n45\n45\n45\n45\n45\n46\n46\n46\n46\n46\n46\n46\nHorns 1.2.\nHorns 3.4.\nTrumpet 1 (C)\nTrumpets 2.3.\n(C)\nTrombones 1.2.\nBass Trombone\n(Trb.3)\nTuba\n\u0153- \u0153- \u0153- \u0153- \u0153 \u0153-\nf\n\u0153- \u0153 \u0153- \u0153- \u0153- \u0153- \u0153-\n\u0153\u0153- \u0153\u0153-\n\u0153\u0153-\n\u0153\u0153-\n\u0153\u0153-\n\u0153\u0153- \u0153\u0153-\n\u0153\u0153-\n\u0153\u0153-\n\u0153\u0153-\n\u0153- \u0153- \u0153- \u0153- \u0153 \u0153-\n\u0153\u0153- \u0153\u0153- \u0153\u0153-\n\u0153\u0153-\n\u0153\u0153-\n\u0153- \u0153- \u0153- \u0153\u0153-\n\u0153- \u0153- \u0153- \u0153\u0153-\nf\nf\nf\nf\nf\n\u0153\u0153-\n\u0153\u0153- \u0153\u0153-\n\u0153\u0153n- \u0153\n\u0153-\n\u0153\u0153-\n\u0153\u0153-\n\u0153\u0153- \u0153\u0153-\n\u0153\u0153- \u0153\u0153n-\n\u0153\u0153-\n\u0153- \u0153 \u0153- \u0153- \u0153- \u0153- \u0153-\n\u0153\u0153-\n\u0153\u0153- \u0153\u0153- \u0153\u0153n- \u0153\u0153- \u0153\u0153-\n\u0153- \u0153- \u0153- \u0153- \u0153n- \u0153-\n\u0153- \u0153- \u0153- \u0153- \u0153n- \u0153-\nTime\nPitch\nTrumpets\nTrombones\nHorns\nTuba\nOriginal \nscore\nPiano-roll\nrepresentation\nFigure 3. Piano-roll representation of orchestral scores.\nThe piano-roll pr is a matrix. A pitch p at time t played\nwith an intensity i is represented by pr(p, t) = i, where 0\nis a note off. This definition is extended to an orchestra by\nsimply concatenating the piano-rolls of every instrument\nalong the pitch dimension.\nSection 3.2.\n3.2 Automatic Alignment\nGiven the diverse origins of the MIDI files, a piano\nscore and its corresponding orchestration are almost never\naligned temporally. These misalignments are very problematic for learning or mining tasks, and in general for any\nprocessing which intends to take advantage of the joint\ninformation provided by the piano and orchestral scores.\nHence, we propose a method to automatically align two\nscores, and released its Python implementation on the\ncompanion website\n2 . More precisely, we consider the\npiano-roll representations (Figure 3) where the scores are\nrepresented as a sequence of vectors. By defining a distance between two vectors, the problem of aligning two\nscores can be cast as a univariate sequence-alignment problem.\n3.2.1 Needleman-Wunsch\nThe Needleman-Wunsch (NW) algorithm [18] is a dynamic\nprogramming technique, which finds the optimal alignment between two symbolic sequences by allowing the introduction of gaps (empty spaces) in the sequences. An\napplication of the NW algorithm to the automatic alignment of musical performances is introduced in [9].\nAs\npointed out in that article, NW is the most adapted technique for aligning two sequences with important structural\ndifferences like skipped parts, for instance.\nThe application of the NW algorithm relies solely on\nthe definition of a cost function, which allows the pairwise\n2 https://qsdfo.github.io/LOP/code\ncomparison of elements from the two sequences, and the\ncost of opening or extending a gap in one of the two sequences.\n3.2.2 Similarity Function\nTo measure the similarity between two chords, we propose\nthe following process:\n\u2022 discard intensities by representing notes being\nplayed as one and zero otherwise.\n\u2022 compute the pitch-class representation of the two\nvectors, which flattens all notes to a single octave\nvector (12 notes). In our case, we set the pitch-class\nto one if at least one note of the class is played. For\ninstance, we set the pitch-class of C to one if there is\nany note with pitch C played in the piano-roll vector.\nThis provides an extremely rough approximation of\nthe harmony, which proved to be sufficient for aligning two scores. After this step, the dimensions of\neach vector is 12.\n\u2022 if one of the vectors is only filled with zeros, it represents a silence, and the similarity is automatically\nset to zero (note that the score function can take negative values).\n\u2022 for two pitch-class vectors A and B, we define the\nscore as\nS(A, B) = C \u00d7\n\ufffd12\ni=1 \u03b4(Ai + Bi)\nmax(||A + B||1, 1)\n(1)\nwhere \u03b4 is defined as:\n\u03b4(x) =\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\n0\nif x = 0\n\u22121\nif x = 1\n1\nif x = 2\nC is a tunable parameter and ||x||1 = \ufffd\ni |xi| is the\nL1 norm.\nBased on the values recommended in [18] and our own\nexperimentations, we set C to 10. The gap-open parameter,\nwhich defines the cost of introducing a gap in one of the\ntwo sequences, is set to 3 and the gap-extend parameter,\nwhich defines the cost of extending a gap in one of the two\nsequences, is set to 1.\n4. AN APPLICATION : PROJECTIVE\nAUTOMATIC ORCHESTRATION\nIn this section, we introduce and formalize the automatic\nprojective orchestration task (Figure 1). In particular, we\npropose a system based on statistical learning and define\nan evaluation framework for using the POD database.\n4.1 Task Definition\n4.1.1 Orchestral Inference\nFor each orchestral piece, we define as O and P the aligned\nsequences of column vectors from the piano-roll of the orchestra and piano parts. We denote as T the length of the\naligned sequences O and P.\n\fThe objective of this task is to infer the present orchestral frame knowing both the recent past of the orchestra\nsequence and the present piano frame. Mathematically, it\nconsists in designing a function f where\n\u02c6O(t) = f[P(t), O(t \u2212 1), ..., O(t \u2212 N)]\n\u2200t \u2208 [N, ...T]\n(2)\nand N defines the order of the model.\n4.1.2 Evaluation Framework\nWe propose a quantitative evaluation framework based on a\none-step predictive task. As discussed in [5], we make the\nassumption that an accurate predictive model will be able\nto generate original acceptable works. Whereas evaluating\nthe generation of a complete musical score is subjective\nand difficult to quantify, a predictive framework provides\nus with a quantitative evaluation of the performance of a\nmodel. Indeed, many satisfying orchestrations can be created from the same piano score. However, the number of\nreasonable inferences of an orchestral frame given its context (as described in equation 2) is much more limited.\nAs suggested in [4,12], the accuracy measure [2] can be\nused to compare an inferred frame \u02c6O(t) drawn from (2) to\nthe ground-truth O(t) from the original file.\nAccuracy(t) = 100 .\nTP(t)\nTP(t) + FP(t) + FN(t)\n(3)\nwhere TP(t) (true positives) is the number of notes correctly predicted (note played in both \u02c6O(t) and O(t)).\nFP(t) (false positive) is the number of notes predicted that\nare not in the original sequence (note played in \u02c6O(t) but\nnot in O(t)). FN(t) (false negative) is the number of unreported notes (note absent in \u02c6O(t), but played in O(t)).\nWhen the quantization gets finer, we observed that a\nmodel which simply repeats the previous frame gradually obtains the best accuracy as displayed in Table ??.\nTo correct this bias, we recommend using an event-level\nevaluation framework where the comparisons between the\nground truth and the model\u2019s output is only performed for\ntime indices in Te defined as the set of indexes te such that\nO(te) \u0338= O(te \u2212 1)\nThe definition of event-level indices can be observed in\nFigure 4.\nIn the context of learning algorithms, splitting the\ndatabase between disjoint train and test subsets is highly\nrecommended [3, pg.32-33], and the performance of a\ngiven model is only assessed on the test subset. Finally,\nthe mean accuracy measure over the dataset is given by\n1\nK\n\ufffd\ns\u2208Dtest\n\ufffd\nte\u2208Te(s)\nAccuracy(te)\n(4)\nwhere Dtest defines the test subset, Te(s) the set of\nevent-time indexes for a given score s, and K\n=\n\ufffd\ns\u2208Dtest |Te(s)|.\n4.2 Proposed Model\nIn this section, we propose a learning-based approach to\ntackle the automatic orchestral inference task.\n4.2.1 Models\nWe present the results for two models called conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (cRBM) and Factored Gated cRBM (FGcRBM). The models we explored\nare defined in a probabilistic framework, where the vectors O(t) and P(t) are represented as binary random variables. The orchestral inference function is a neural network that expresses the conditional dependencies between\nthe different variables: the present orchestral frame O(t),\nthe present piano frame P(t) and the past orchestral frames\nO(t \u2212 1, ..., t \u2212 N). Hidden units are introduced to model\nthe co-activation of these variables.\nTheir number is a\nhyper-parameter with an order of magnitude of 1000. A\ntheoretical introduction to these models can be found in\n[26], whereas their application to projective orchestration\nis detailed in [7].\n4.2.2 Data Representation\nIn order to process the scores, we import them as pianoroll matrices (see Figure 3). Their extension to orchestral\nscores is obtained by concatenating the piano-rolls of each\ninstrument along the pitch dimension.\nThen, new events te \u2208 Te are extracted from both\npiano-rolls as described in Section 4.1. A consequence is\nthat the trained model apprehends the scores as a succession of events with no rhythmic structure. This is a simplification that considers the rhythmic structure of the projected orchestral score to be exactly the same as the one of\nthe original piano score. This is false in the general case,\nsince a composer can decide to add nonexistent events in\nan orchestration. However, this provides a reasonable approximation that is verified in a vast majority of cases.\nDuring the generation of an orchestral score given a piano\nscore, the next orchestral frame is predicted in the eventlevel framework, but inserted at the temporal location of\nthe corresponding piano frame as depicted in Figure 4.\nAutomatic alignment of the two piano-rolls is performed on the event-level representations, as described in\nSection 3.2.\nIn order to reduce the input dimensionality, we systematically remove any pitch which is never played in the\ntraining database for each instrument. With that simplification the dimension of the orchestral vector typically decreases from 3584 to 795 and the piano vector dimension\nfrom 128 to 89. Also, we follow the usual orchestral simplifications used when writing orchestral scores by grouping together all the instruments of a same section. For instance, the violin section, which might be composed by\nseveral instrumentalists, is written as a single part. Finally,\nthe velocity information is discarded, since we use binary\nunits that solely indicate if a note is on or off.\nEventually, we observed that an important proportion of\nthe frames are silences, which mathematically corresponds\nto a column vector filled with zeros in the piano-roll representation. A consequence of the over-representation of\nsilences is that a model trained on this database will lean\ntowards orchestrating with a silence any piano input, which\nis statistically the most relevant choice. Therefore, orches-\n\fFrame level\nEvent level\nPiano\nOrchestra\nPitch\nTime\nFigure 4. From a piano score, the generation of an orchestral score consists in extracting the event-level representation of the piano score, generating the sequence of\norchestral events, and then injecting them at the position\nof the event from the piano score. Note that the silence in\nthe fourth event of the piano score is not orchestrated by\nthe probabilistic model, but is automatically mapped to a\nsilence in the orchestral version.\ntration of silences in the piano score (P(t) = 0) are not\nused as training points. However, it is important to note\nthat they are not removed from the piano-rolls. Hence, silences could still appear in the past sequence of a training\npoint, since it is a valuable information regarding the structure of the piece. During generation time, the silences in\nthe piano score are automatically orchestrated with a silence in the orchestra score. Besides, silences are taken\ninto consideration when computing the accuracy.\n4.2.3 Results\nThe results of the cRBM and FGcRBM on the orchestral\ninference task are compared to two na\u00a8\u0131ve models. The first\nmodel is a random generation of the orchestral frames obtained by sampling a Bernoulli distribution of parameter\n0.5. The second model predicts an orchestral frame at time\nt by simply repeating the frame at time t \u2212 1. The results\nare summed up in Table ??.\n4.3 Discussion\nAs expected, the random model obtains very poor results.\nThe repeat model outperform all three other models, surprisingly even in the event-level framework. Indeed, we\nobserved that repeated notes still occur frequently in the\nevent-level framework. For instance, if between two successive events only one note out of five is modified, the\naccuracy of the repeat model on this frame will be equal to\n66%.\nIf the FGcRBM model outperforms the cRBM model\nin the frame-level framework, the cRBM is slightly better\nthan the FGcRBM model in the event-level framework.\nGenerations from both models can be listened to on the\ncompanion website 3 . Even though some fragments are\ncoherent regarding the piano score and the recent past orchestration, the results are mostly unsatisfying. Indeed, we\nobserved that the models learn an extremely high probability for every note to be off. Using regularization methods\nsuch as weight decay has not proven efficient. We believe\nthat this is due to the sparsity of the vectors O(t) we try to\ngenerate, and finding a more adapted data representation\nof the input will be a crucial step.\n5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nWe introduced the Projective Orchestral Database (POD),\na collection of MIDI files dedicated to the study of the relations between piano scores and corresponding orchestrations. We believe that the recent advent in machine learning and data mining has provided the proper tools to take\nadvantage of this important mass of information and investigate the correlations between a piano score and its orchestrations. We provide all MIDI files freely, along with\naligned and non-aligned pre-processed piano-roll representations on the website https://qsdfo.github.\nio/LOP/index.html.\nWe proposed a task called automatic orchestral inference. Given a piano score and a corresponding orchestration, it consists in trying to predict orchestral time frames,\nknowing the corresponding piano frame and the recent past\nof the orchestra. Then, we introduced an evaluation framework for this task based on a train and test split of the\ndatabase, and the definition of an accuracy measure. We\nfinally present the results of two models (the cRBM and\nFGcRBM) in this framework.\nWe hope that the POD will be useful for many researchers. Besides the projective orchestration task we defined in this article, the database can be used in several\nother applications, such as generating data for a sourceseparation model [17]. Even if small errors still persist, we\nthoroughly checked manually the database and guarantee\nits good quality. However, the number of files collected\nis still small with the aim of leading statistical investigations. Hence, we also hope that people will contribute to\nenlarge this database by sharing files and helping us gather\nthe missing information.\n6.

Introduction\nSymbolic music datasets are important for music information retrieval (MIR) and musical analysis.\nIn the\nWestern music tradition, musicians use musical notation to write music.\nThis notation includes pitches,\nrhythms, and chords of music. Musicologists used to\nanalyse music works by reading music notation. Recently, computers have been used to process and analyse large-scale data and have been widely used in MIR.\nHowever, there is a lack of large-scale symbolic music\ndatasets covering a wide range of solo piano works.\nOne difficulty of computer-based MIR is that musical notation such as staffs is not directly readable by\na computer. Therefore, converting music notation into\ncomputer-readable formats is important. Early works\nof converting music into symbolic representations can\nbe traced back to the 1900s, when piano rolls (Bryner,\n2002; Shi et al., 2019) were developed to record music that could be played on a musical instrument. Pi-\n*ByteDance\nano rolls are continuous rolls of paper with perforations punched into them. In 1981, Musical Instrument\nDigital Interface (MIDI) (Smith and Wood, 1981) was\nproposed as a technical standard to represent music\nand can be read by a computer. MIDI files use event\nmessages to specify the instructions of music, including pitch, onset, offset, and velocity of notes.\nMIDI\nfiles also carry rich information of music events such\nas sustain pedals. The MIDI format has been popular\nfor music production in recent years.\nIn this work, we focus on building a large-scale\nMIDI dataset for classical solo piano music.\nThere\nare several previous piano MIDI datasets including\nthe piano-midi.de (Krueger, 1996) dataset, the MAESTRO dataset (Hawthorne et al., 2019), the classical\narchives (Classical Archives, 2000) dataset, and the\nKunstderfuge dataset (Kunstderfuge, 2002). However,\nthose datasets are limited to hundreds of composers\nand hundreds of hours of unique works (Kunstderfuge,\n2002). MusicXML (Good et al., 2001) is another sym-\narXiv:2010.07061v3  [cs.IR]  21 Apr 2022\n\f2\nAnonymous: GiantMIDI-Piano: A large-scale MIDI Dataset for Classical Piano Music\nbolic format of music, while there are fewer MusicXML\ndatasets than MIDI datasets. Other machine-readable\nformats include the music encoding initiative (MEI)\n(Roland, 2002), Humdrum Sapp (2005), and LilyPond\n(Nienhuys and Nieuwenhuizen (2003)). Optical music recognition (OMR) (Rebelo et al., 2012; Bainbridge\nand Bell, 2001) is a technique to transcribe image\nscores into symbolic formats.\nHowever, the performance of OMR systems is limited to score qualities.\nIn this article, we collect and transcribe a largescale classical piano MIDI dataset called GiantMIDIPiano.\nTo our knowledge, GiantMIDI-Piano is the\nlargest piano MIDI dataset so far. GiantMIDI-Piano is\ncollected as follows: 1) We parse the names of composers and the names of music works from the International Music Score Library Project (IMSLP)1; 2) We\nsearch and download audio recordings of all matching\nmusic works from YouTube; 3) We build a solo piano\ndetection system to detect solo piano recordings; 4)\nWe transcribe solo piano recordings into MIDI files using a high-resolution piano transcription system (Kong\net al., 2021). In this article, we analyse the statistics\nof GiantMIDI-Piano, including the number of works,\ndurations of works, and nationalities of composers. In\naddition, we analyse the statistics of note, interval, and\nchord distribution of six composers from different eras\nto show that GiantMIDI-Piano can be used for musical\nanalysis.\n1.1\nApplications\nThe GiantMIDI-Piano dataset can be used in many\nresearch areas, including 1) Computer-based musical analysis (Volk et al., 2011; Meredith, 2016) such\nas using computers to analyse the structure, chords,\nand melody of music works. 2) Symbolic music generation (Yang et al., 2017; Hawthorne et al., 2019)\nsuch as generating symbolic music in symbolic format. 3) Computer-based music information retrieval\n(Casey et al., 2008; Choi et al., 2017) such as music\ntranscription and music tagging. 4) Expressive performance analysis (Cancino-Chac\u00f3n et al., 2018) such as\nanalysing the performance of different pianists.\nThis paper is organised as follows: Section 2 surveys piano MIDI datasets; Section 3 introduces the collection of the GiantMIDI-Piano dataset; Section 4 investigates the statistics of the GiantMIDI-Piano dataset;\nSection 5 evaluates the quality of the GiantMIDI-Piano\ndataset.\n2. Dataset Survey\nWe introduce several piano MIDI datasets as follows.\nThe Piano-midi.de dataset (Krueger, 1996) contains\nclassical solo piano works entered by a MIDI sequencer.\nPiano-midi.de contains 571 works composed by 26\ncomposers with a total duration of 36.7 hours till\nFeb. 2020. The classical archives collection (Classi-\n1https://imslp.org\nTable 1: Piano MIDI datasets.

All of\nthe piano-midi.de, classical archives, and Kunstderfuge\ndatasets are entered using a MIDI sequencer and are\nnot played by pianists.\nThe MAPS dataset (Emiya et al., 2010) used MIDI\nfiles from Piano-midi.de to render real recordings by\nplaying back the MIDI files on a Yamaha Disklavier. The\nMAESTRO dataset (Hawthorne et al., 2019) contains\nover 200 hours of fine alignment MIDI files and audio\nrecordings. In MAESTRO, virtuoso pianists performed\non Yamaha Disklaviers with an integrated MIDI capture\nsystem. MAESTRO contains music works from 62 composers. There are several duplicated works in MAESTRO. For example, there are 11 versions of Scherzo\nNo. 2 in B-flat Minor, Op. 31 composed by Chopin.\nAll duplicated works are removed when calculating the\nnumber and duration of works.\nTable 1 shows the number of composers, the number of unique works, total durations, and data types of\ndifferent MIDI datasets. Data types include sequenced\n(Seq.) MIDI files input by MIDI sequencers and performed (Perf.) MIDI files played by pianists. There are\nother MIDI datasets including the Lakh dataset (Raffel, 2016), the Bach Doodle dataset (Huang et al.,\n2019), the Bach Chorales dataset (Conklin and Witten, 1995), the URMP dataset (Li et al., 2018),\nthe Bach10 dataset (Duan et al., 2010), the CrestMusePEDB dataset (Hashida et al., 2008), the SUPRA\ndataset (Shi et al., 2019), and the ASAP dataset (Foscarin et al., 2020).\n(Huang et al., 2018) collected\n10,000 hours of piano recordings for music generation,\nbut the dataset is not publicly available.\n\f3\nAnonymous: GiantMIDI-Piano: A large-scale MIDI Dataset for Classical Piano Music\n3. GiantMIDI-Piano Dataset\n3.1 Metadata from IMSLP\nTo begin with, we acquire the names of composers and\nthe names of music works by parsing the webpages of\nthe International Music Score Library Project (IMSLP,\n2006), the largest publicly available music library in\nthe world. In IMSLP, each composer has a webpage\ncontaining the list of their work names. We acquire\n143,701 music works composed by 18,067 composers\nby parsing those web pages.\nFor each composer, if\nthere exists a biography link on the composer page, we\naccess that biography link to search for their birth year,\ndeath year, and nationality. We set the birth year, death\nyear, and nationality to \u201cunknown\u201d if a composer does\nnot have such a biography link. We obtain the nationalities of 4,274 composers and births of 5,981 composers\nout of 18,067 composers by automatically parsing the\nbiography links.\nAs the automatically parsed meta information of\ncomposers from the internet is incomplete, we manually check the nationalities, births, and deaths for\n2,786 composers. We label 2,291 birth years, 2,254\ndeath years, and 2,115 nationalities by searching the\ninformation of composers on the internet. We label not\nfound birth years, death years, and nationalities as \u201cunknown\u201d. We create metadata files containing the information of composers and music works, respectively.\n3.2 Search Audio\nWe search audio recordings on YouTube by using a keyword of first name, surname, music work name from\nthe metadata. For each keyword, we select the first\nreturned result on YouTube.\nHowever, there can be\ncases where the returned YouTube title may not exactly match the keyword.\nFor example, for a keyword Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, Scherzo No.2 Op.31, the top returned result can be Chopin - Scherzo No. 2, Op. 31\n(Rubinstein). Although the keyword and the returned\nYouTube title are different, they indicate the same music work.\nWe denote the set of words in a searching keyword as X and the set of words in a returned\nYouTube title as Y .\nWe propose a modified Jaccard\nsimilarity (Niwattanakul et al., 2013) to evaluate how\nmuch a keyword and a returned result are matched.\nThe original Jaccard similarity is defined as J =\n|X \u2229Y |/(|X |\u222a|Y |). The drawback of this original Jaccard\nsimilarity is that the length of the searched YouTube title |Y | can be long, so that J will be small. This is often\nthe case because searched YouTube titles usually contain extra words such as the names of performers and\nthe dates of performances. Our aim is to define a metric where the denominator only depends on the searching keyword |X | and is independent of the length of the\nsearched YouTube title |Y |. We propose a modified Jaccard similarity (Niwattanakul et al., 2013) between X\nand Y as:\nJ = |X \u2229Y |/|X |.\n(1)\nHigher J indicates that X and Y have larger similarity,\nand lower J indicates that X and Y have less similarity.\nWe empirically set a similarity threshold to 0.6 to balance the precision and recall of searched results. If J\nis strictly larger than this threshold, then we say X are\nY are matched, and vice versa. In total, we retrieve\nand download 60,724 audio recordings out of 143,701\nmusic works.\n3.3\nSolo Piano Detection\nWe detect solo piano works from IMSLP to build the\nGiantMIDI-Piano dataset. Filtering music works with\nkeywords containing \u201cpiano\u201d may lead to incorrect results. For example, a \u201cPiano Concerto\u201d is an ensemble\nof piano and orchestra which is not solo piano. On the\nother hand, the keyword Chopin, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, Nocturnes,\nOp.62 does not contain the word \u201cpiano\u201d, but it is indeed a solo piano. To address this problem, we train an\naudio-based solo piano detection system using a convolutional neural network (CNN) (Kong et al., 2020).\nThe piano detection system takes 1-second segments\nas input and extracts log mel spectrograms as input to\nthe CNN.\nThe CNN consists of four convolutional layers. Each\nconvolutional layer consists of a linear convolutional\noperation with a kernel size of 3 \u00d7 3, a batch normalization (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015), and a ReLU nonlinearity (Glorot et al., 2011). The output of the CNN\npredicts the solo piano probability of a segment. Binary cross-entropy is used as a loss function to train\nthe CNN. We collect solo piano recordings as positive\nsamples and collect music and other sounds as negative\nsamples. In addition, the mixtures of piano and other\nsounds are also used as negative samples. In inference,\nwe average the predictions of all 1-second segments of\na recording to calculate its solo piano probability. We\nregard an audio recording as solo piano if the probability is strictly larger than 0.5 and vice versa. In total,\nwe obtain 10,855 solo pianos composed by 2,786 composers out of 60,724 downloaded audio recordings.\nThese 10,855 audio files are transcribed into MIDI files\nwhich constitute the full GiantMIDI-Piano dataset.\n3.4\nConstrain Composer Surnames\nAmong the detected 10,855 solo piano works, there\nare several music works composed by not well-known\ncomposers but are attached to famous composers. For\nexample, there are 273 searched music works assigned\nto Chopin, but only 102 of them are actually composed by Chopin, while other music works are composed by other composers. To alleviate this problem,\nwe create a curated subset by constraining the titles of\ndownloaded audio recordings containing the surnames\nof composers. After this constraint, we obtain a curated GiantMIDI-Piano dataset containing 7,236 music\nworks composed by 1,787 composers.\n\f4\nAnonymous: GiantMIDI-Piano: A large-scale MIDI Dataset for Classical Piano Music\nLiszt, Franz\nScarlatti, Domenico\nBach, Johann Sebastian\nSchubert, Franz\nChopin, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric\nCarbajo, V\u00edctor\nBeethoven, Ludwig van\nMozart, Wolfgang Amadeu\nSimpson, Daniel L\u00e9o\nScriabin, Aleksandr\nCzerny, Carl\nHandel, George Frideric\nRebikov, Vladimir\nHaydn, Joseph\nSatie, Erik\nChaminade, C\u00e9cile\nAlkan, Charles-Valentin\nLack, Th\u00e9odore\nTurina, Joaqu\u00edn\nRaff, Joachim\nZhang, Shuwen\nHummel, Johann Nepomuk\nHeller, Stephen\nTinel, Jef\nMedtner, Nikolay\nSchumann, Robert\nMoszkowski, Moritz\nJohnson, Charles Leslie\nScharwenka, Xaver\nJoplin, Scott\nTeilman, Christian\nMeyer-Helmund, Erik\nFaur\u00e9, Gabriel\nBalakirev, Mily\nGottschalk, Louis Morea\nGodard, Benjamin\nRavina, Jean Henri\nDebussy, Claude\nTchaikovsky, Pyotr\nProkofiev, Sergey\nPoulenc, Francis\nMendelssohn, Felix\nGrieg, Edvard\nWachs, Paul\nVilla-Lobos, Heitor\nRzewski, Frederic\nNazareth, Ernesto\nBrahms, Johannes\nRachmaninoff, Sergei\nHitz, Franz\nBusoni, Ferruccio\nVictoria, Tom\u00e1s Luis de\nScott, James\nScott, Cyril\nLange, Gustav\nGurlitt, Cornelius\nStanchinsky, Aleksey\nSch\u00fctt, Eduard\nKrzy anowski, Ignacy\nGr\u00fcnfeld, Alfred\nGodowsky, Leopold\nFerrari, Carlotta\nOrnstein, Leo\nLyapunov, Sergey\nHarrington, Jeffrey Mic\nAgnew, Roy\nGranados, Enrique\nDi Gesu, Massimo\nClementi, Muzio\nWieniawski, J\u00f3zef\nWeber, Carl Maria von\nRavel, Maurice\nMyaskovsky, Nikolay\nMourey, Colette\nMerino Mart\u00ednez, Aitor\nMarmontel, Antoine Fran\nLyadov, Anatoly\nHiller, Ferdinand\nGlinka, Mikhail\nGlazunov, Aleksandr\nCasella, Alfredo\nBlumenfeld, Felix\nBertini, Henri\nViolette, Andrew\nSt. Clair, Richard\nShirley, Nathan\nSchumann, Clara\nRowley, Alec\nNichifor, Serban\nMacchi, Claudio\nKuhlau, Friedrich\nHenselt, Adolf von\nHahn, Reynaldo\nCui, C\u00e9sar\nBortkiewicz, Sergei\nBendel, Franz\nBeach, Amy Marcy\nBart\u00f3k, B\u00e9la\nArensky, Anton\nAlb\u00e9niz, Isaac\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n125\n150\n175\n200\nNumber of works\n141\n140\n129\n96\n96\n77\n76\n72\n69\n67\n58\n57\n54\n54\n52\n45\n39\n38\n37\n37\n36\n36\n35\n34\n34\n33\n32\n32\n31\n31\n30\n30\n30\n30\n29\n28\n27\n27\n26\n26\n26\n24\n24\n23\n22\n22\n22\n22\n21\n21\n21\n20\n20\n20\n20\n20\n19\n19\n19\n19\n19\n19\n18\n18\n18\n18\n17\n17\n17\n16\n16\n16\n16\n16\n16\n16\n16\n16\n16\n16\n16\n16\n16\n15\n15\n15\n15\n15\n15\n15\n15\n15\n15\n15\n15\n15\n15\n15\n15\n15\n242\n228\n793\n703\n109\n81\n286\n613\n198\n83\n83\n224\n57\n557\n76\n115\n61\n45\n61\n73\n39\n86\n106\n73\n60\n116\n48\n39\n48\n35\n30\n31\n87\n46\n72\n51\n34\n87\n123\n72\n77\n119\n62\n27\n75\n48\n27\n104\n44\n21\n36\n129\n21\n33\n24\n23\n21\n20\n19\n32\n26\n389\n29\n29\n89\n18\n21\n26\n25\n21\n48\n51\n48\n43\n35\n16\n27\n40\n34\n81\n32\n19\n16\n58\n51\n26\n26\n37\n155\n57\n38\n20\n63\n33\n22\n17\n29\n47\n33\n23\nComplete works\nSolo piano works\nFigure 1: Number of solo piano works of the curated GP dataset.

The piano transcription system is trained on the training subset of the MAESTRO dataset version 2.0.0 (Hawthorne\net al., 2019). The training and testing subset contain\n161.3 and 20.5 hours of aligned piano recordings and\nMIDI files, respectively. The piano transcription system\npredicts all of the pitch, onset, offset, and velocity at-\n2https://github.com/bytedance/piano_transcription\ntributes of notes. The transcribed results also include\nsustain pedals. For piano note transcription, our system consists of a frame-wise classification, an onset regression, an offset regression, and a velocity regression\nsub-module. Each sub-module is modeled by a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) with eight\nconvolutional layers and two bi-directional gated recurrent units (GRU) layers. The output of each module has a dimension of 88, equivalent to the number of\nnotes on a modern piano.\nThe pedal transcription system has the same architecture as the note transcription system, except that\nthere is only one output after the CRNN sub-module\nindicating the onset or offset probabilities of pedals.\nIn inference, all piano recordings are converted into\nmono with a sampling rate of 16 kHz. We use a shorttime Fourier transform (STFT) with a Hann window\nsize 2048 and a hop size 160 to extract spectrograms,\nso there are 100 frames in a second. Then, mel filter\nbanks with 229 bins are used to extract log mel spectrogram as input feature (Hawthorne et al., 2019). The\ntranscription system outputs the predicted probabilities of pitch, onset, offset, and velocity. Finally, those\noutputs are post-processed into MIDI events.\n4.

and\nblack bars correspond to the white and black keys on a\nmodern piano, respectively. Fig. 4 shows that the note\nhistogram has a normal distribution. The most played\nnote is G4. There are more notes close to G4 and less\nnotes far from G4. The most played notes are within\nthe octave between C4 and C5. White keys are being\nplayed more often than black keys.\nFig.\n5 visualizes the note histogram of three\ncomposers from different eras, including J. S. Bach,\nBeethoven, and Liszt. The note range of J. S. Bach is\nmostly between C2 and C6 covering four octaves, which\nis consistent with the note range of a conventional\nharpsichord or organ. The note range of Beethoven\nis mostly between F1 and C7 covering five and a half\noctaves. The note range of Liszt is the widest, covering\nthe whole range of a modern piano.\n4.5 Pitch Distribution of Top 100 Composers\nFig. 6 shows the pitch distribution sorted in ascending order over the top 100 composers in Fig. 2 of the\ncurated GiantMIDI-Piano dataset. The average pitches\nof most composers are between C4 and C5, where C4\ncorresponds to a MIDI pitch value 60. The shades indicate the one standard deviation area of pitch distributions. Jeffrey Michael Harrington has the lowest average pitch value of C4. Carl Czerny has the highest\naverage pitch value of A4.\n4.6\nThe Number of Notes Per Second Distribution of\nTop 100 Composers\nFig.\n7 shows the number of notes per second distribution sorted in ascending order over the top 100\ncomposers in Fig. 2 of the curated GiantMIDI-Piano\ndataset. The number of notes per second is calculated\nby dividing all works notes number by all works duration of a composer. The average numbers of notes per\nsecond of most composers are between 5 and 10. The\nshades indicate the one standard deviation area of the\nnumber of notes per second distribution. Alfred Gr\u00fcnfeld has the smallest number of notes per second with\na value of 4.18. Carl Czerny has the largest number of\nnotes per second with a value of 13.61.\n4.7\nPitch Class Distribution\nWe\ndenote\nthe\nset\nof\npitch\nnames\nas\n{C,C\u266f,D,D\u266f,E,F,F\u266f,G,G\u266f,A,A\u266f,B}.\nThe notes from C\nto B are denoted as 0 to 11 (Forte, 1973), respectively.\nWe calculate the statistics of six composers from\ndifferent eras including J. S. Bach, Mozart, Beethoven,\nChopin, Liszt, and Debussy. Fig. 8 shows that J. S.\nBach used D, E, G, and A most in his solo piano works.\nMozart used C, D, F, and G most in his solo piano\nworks and used more A\u266f/B\u266d than other composers.\nBeethoven used more C, D, and G than other notes.\n\f7\nAnonymous: GiantMIDI-Piano: A large-scale MIDI Dataset for Classical Piano Music\nC C D D E F F G G A A B\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\nFrequency\nBach, Johann Sebastian\nC C D D E F F G G A A B\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\nFrequency\nMozart, Wolfgang Amadeus\nC C D D E F F G G A A B\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\nFrequency\nBeethoven, Ludwig van\nC C D D E F F G G A A B\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\nFrequency\nChopin, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric\nC C D D E F F G G A A B\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\nFrequency\nLiszt, Franz\nC C D D E F F G G A A B\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\nFrequency\nDebussy, Claude\nFigure 8: Pitch class distribution of six composers of\nthe curated GP dataset.\n-11\n-10\n-9\n-8\n-7\n-6\n-5\n-4\n-3\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\nFrequency\nBach, Johann Sebastian\n-11\n-10\n-9\n-8\n-7\n-6\n-5\n-4\n-3\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\nMozart, Wolfgang Amadeus\n-11\n-10\n-9\n-8\n-7\n-6\n-5\n-4\n-3\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\nBeethoven, Ludwig van\n-11\n-10\n-9\n-8\n-7\n-6\n-5\n-4\n-3\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\nFrequency\nChopin, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric\n-11\n-10\n-9\n-8\n-7\n-6\n-5\n-4\n-3\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\nLiszt, Franz\n-11\n-10\n-9\n-8\n-7\n-6\n-5\n-4\n-3\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\nDebussy, Claude\nFigure 9: Interval distribution of six composers of the\ncurated GP dataset.\nChopin used D\u266f/E\u266d and G\u266f/A\u266d most in his solo piano\nworks. Liszt and Debussy used all twelve pitch classes\nmore uniformly in their solo piano works than other\ncomposers. Liszt used E most, and Debussy used C\u266f/D\u266d\nmost. As expected, most of Baroque and classical solo\npiano works were in keys close to C, whereas Romantic\nand later composers explored distant keys and tended\nto use all twelve pitch classes more uniformly.\n4.8 Interval Distribution\nAn interval is the pitch difference between two notes.\nIntervals can be either melodic intervals or harmonic\nintervals. A harmonic interval is the pitch difference of\ntwo notes being played at the same time. A melodic\ninterval is the pitch difference between two successive notes. We consider both harmonic intervals and\nmelodic intervals as intervals. We calculate the distribution of intervals of six composers. Notes are represented as a list of events in a MIDI format. We calculate\nan interval as:\n\u2206 = yn \u2212 yn\u22121,\n(2)\nwhere yn is the MIDI pitch of a note and n is the index\nof the note.\nWe calculate ordered intervals including both positive intervals and negative intervals. For example, the\ninterval \u2206 for an upward progress from C4 to D4 is 2,\nand the interval \u2206 for a downward progress from C4\nto A3 is \u22123. We only consider intervals between -11\nto 11 (included) and discard the intervals outside this\nregion. For example, the value 11 indicates a major\nseventh interval. Fig. 9 shows the interval distribution\nof six composers. All composers used major second and\nminor third most in their works. The interval distribution is not symmetric to the origin. For example, J. S.\nFigure 10: Trichord distribution of six composers of\nthe curated GP dataset. Rel. frequency is the abbreviation for relative frequency.\nFigure 11: Tetrachord distribution of six composers of\nthe curated GP dataset.\nBach and Mozart used more downward major second\nthan the upward major second. In the works of J. S.\nBach, the dip in the interval 0 indicates that repeated\nnotes are less commonly used than non-repeated notes.\nOther composers used more repeated notes than J. S.\nBach. Major seventh and tritone are least used by all\ncomposers. Some Romantic and later composers, including Chopin, Liszt, and Debussy used all intervals\nmore uniformly than J. S. Bach from Baroque era.\n4.9\nTrichord Distribution\nWe adopt the set musical theory (Forte, 1973) to analyse the chord distribution in GiantMIDI-Piano. A trichord is a set of any three pitch-classes (Forte, 1973).\nSince GiantMIDI-Piano is transcribed from real recordings, notes of a chord are usually not played simultaneously. We consider notes within a window of 50 ms\nas a chord. The windows are non-overlapped. Each\nnote only belongs to one chord. For a special case of\na set of onsets at 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 ms, our system first searches chords in a window starting from 0\nms and returns {0, 25, 50}. Then, the system searches\nchords in a window starting from 75 ms and returns\n{75, 100}.\nWe discard the pitch sets with more or\nless than three notes within a 50 ms window to ensure\nchords are trichords. The sliding window for counting pitch sets will ensure that there are no overlapped\nwhen counting trichords. A major triad can be written as {0,4,7}, where the interval between 0 and 4 is a\nmajor third, and the interval between 4 and 7 is a minor third. We transpose all chords to chords with lower\nnotes C. For example, a chord {2,6,9} is transposed into\n\f8\nAnonymous: GiantMIDI-Piano: A large-scale MIDI Dataset for Classical Piano Music\n0.00\n0.10\n0.20\n0.30\n0.40\n0.50\n0.60\n0.70\n0.80\n0.90\nThresholds\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nScores\nPrecision\nRecall\nF1\nFigure 12: Precision, recall, and F1 score of solo piano\ndetection.\n{0,4,7}. We merge chords with the same prime form.\nFig.\n10 shows the trichord distribution of six composers.\nAll composers used major triad {0,4,7} most\nfollowed by minor triad {0,3,7} in their works. Liszt\nused more augmented triad {0,4,8} than other composers. Debussy used more {0,2,5}, {0,2,4} than other\ncomposers which distinguished him from other composers. Fig. 10 shows that composers from different\neras have different preferences for using trichords.\n4.10 Tetrachord Distribution\nA tetrachord is a set of any four pitch-classes (Forte,\n1973). Similar to trichord, we consider notes within\na window of 50 ms as a chord. We discard the pitch\nsets with more or less than four notes within a 50 ms\nwindow to ensure chords are tetrachords.\nA dominant seventh chord can be denoted as {0,4,7,10}. Fig.\n11 shows the tetrachord distribution of six composers.\nSeventh chords such as {0,2,6,9} are transposed to root\nposition seventh chords {0,4,7,10}. Fig. 11 shows that\nBach, Beethoven and Mozart, and Chopin used dominant seventh {0,4,7,10} most. Liszt used diminished\nseventh {0,3,6,9} most and Debussy used minor seventh\n{0,3,7,10} most. J. S. Bach used less dominant seventh\ncompared to the other five composers. The tetrachord\ndistribution of Debussy is different from other composers. Fig. 11 shows that composers from different\neras have different preferences for using tetrachords.\n5. Evaluation of GiantMIDI-Piano\n5.1 Solo Piano Evaluation\nWe evaluate the solo piano detection system as follows.\nWe manually label 200 randomly selected music works\nfrom 60,724 downloaded audio recordings. We calculate the precision, recall, and F1 scores of the solo piano detection system with different thresholds ranging\nfrom 0.1 to 0.9 and show results in Fig. 12. Horizontal\nand vertical axes show different thresholds and scores,\nrespectively. Fig. 12 shows that higher thresholds lead\nto higher precision but lower recall.\nWhen we set\nthe threshold to 0.5, the solo piano detection system\nachieves a precision, recall, and F1 score of 89.66%,\nTable 2: Accuracy of retrieved music works of six composers.\nJ.

In this work, we set\nthe threshold to 0.5 to balance the precision and recall\nfor solo piano detection.\n5.2\nMetadata Evaluation\nWe randomly select 200 solo piano works from the\nfull GiantMIDI-Piano dataset and manually check how\nmany audio recordings and metadata are matched.\nWe observe that 174 out of 200 solo piano works are\ncorrectly matched, leading to a metadata accuracy of\n87%. Most errors are caused by mismatched composer\nnames. For example, when the keyword X is Chartier,\nMathieu, Nocturne No.1 composed by Chartier, the retrieved YouTube title Y is Nocturne No. 1 composed by\nChopin. After surname constraint, 136 out of 140 solo\npiano works are correctly matched, leading to a precision of 97.14%. We also observe that there are 180 live\nperformances and 20 sequenced MIDI files out of 200\nsolo piano works.\nFurthermore, Table 2 shows the number of matched\nmusic works composed by six different composers. Correct indicates that the retrieved solo piano works are\nindeed composed by the composer. Incorrect indicates\nthat the retrieved music works are not composed by\nthe composer but are composed by someone else and\nare attached to the composer. Without surname constraint, Liszt achieves the highest match accuracy of\n90%, while Chopin achieves the lowest match accuracy of 37%. Table 3 shows that the match accuracy\nof Chopin increases from 37% to 82% after surname\nconstraint. The accuracy of other composers also increases. The curated GiantMIDI-Piano dataset contains\n7,236 MIDI files composed by 1,787 composers. We\nuse a youtube_title_contains_surname flag in the metadata file to indicate whether the surname is verified.\n5.3\nPiano Transcription Evaluation\nThe piano transcription system achieves a state-of-theart onset F1 score of 96.72%, onset and offset F1 score\nof 82.47%, and an onset, offset, and velocity F1 score\nof 80.92% on the test set of the MAESTRO dataset.\nThe sustain pedal transcription system achieves an onset F1 of 91.86%, and a sustain-pedal onset and off-\n\f9\nAnonymous: GiantMIDI-Piano: A large-scale MIDI Dataset for Classical Piano Music\nS\nD\nI\nER\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\nMaestro\nS\nD\nI\nER\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\nGiantMIDI-Piano\nS\nD\nI\nER\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\nRelative difference\nFigure 13: From left to right: ER of 52 solo piano works in the MAESTRO dataset; ER of 52 solo piano works in\nthe GiantMIDI-Piano dataset; Relative ER between the MAESTRO and the GiantMIDI-Piano dataset.\nset F1 of 86.58%.\nThe piano transcription system\noutperforms the previous onsets and frames system\nHawthorne et al. (2018, 2019) with an onset F1 score\nof 94.80%.\nWe evaluate the quality of GiantMIDI-Piano on 52\nmusic works that appear in all of the GiantMIDI-Piano,\nthe MAESTRO, and the Kunsterfuge (Kunstderfuge,\n2002) datasets.\nLong music works such as Sonatas\nare split into movements. Repeated music sections are\nremoved. Evaluating GiantMIDI-Piano is a challenging problem because there are no aligned ground-truth\nMIDI files, so the metrics in (Hawthorne et al., 2018)\nare not usable.\nIn this work, we propose to use an\nalignment metric (Nakamura et al., 2017) called error\nrate (ER) to evaluate the quality of transcribed MIDI\nfiles.\nThis metric reflects the substitution, deletion,\nand insertion between a transcribed MIDI file and a\ntarget MIDI file.\nFor a solo piano work, we align a\ntranscribed MIDI file with its sequenced MIDI version\nusing a hidden Markov model (HMM) tool (Nakamura\net al., 2017), where the sequenced MIDI files are from\nthe Kunsterfuge (Kunstderfuge, 2002) dataset. The ER\nis defined as the summation of substitution, insertion,\nand deletion:\nER = S +D + I\nN\n,\n(3)\nwhere N is the number of reference notes, and S, I,\nand D are the number of substitution, insertion, and\ndeletion, respectively. Substitution indicates that some\nnotes are replacements of ground truth notes. Insertion indicates that extra notes are being played. Deletion indicates that some notes are missing. Lower ER\nindicates better transcription performance.\nThe ER of music works from GiantMIDI-Piano consists of three parts: 1) performance errors, 2) transcription errors, and 3) alignment errors:\nERG = eperformanceG +etranscriptionG +ealignmentG\n(4)\nwhere\nthe\nsubscript\nG\nis\nthe\nabbreviation\nfor\nGiantMIDI-Piano. The performance errors eperformanceG\nTable 4: Piano\ntranscription\nevaluation\non\nthe\nGiantMIDI-Piano dataset\nD\nI\nS\nER\nMaestro\n0.009\n0.024\n0.018\n0.061\nGiantMIDI-Piano\n0.015\n0.051\n0.069\n0.154\nRelative difference\n0.006\n0.026\n0.047\n0.094\ncome from that a pianist may accidentally miss or add\nnotes while performing (Repp, 1996). The transcription errors etranscriptionG come from piano transcription\nsystem errors. The alignment errors ealignmentG come\nfrom the sequence alignment algorithm (Nakamura\net al., 2017).\nAudio recordings and MIDI files are perfectly\naligned in the MAESTRO dataset, so there are no transcription errors. The ER can be written as:\nERM = eperformanceM +ealignmentM,\n(5)\nwhere the subscript M is the abbreviation for MAESTRO. For a same music work, we assume an approximation eperformanceG \u2248 eperformanceM despite the performance among pianists are different. Similarly, we assume an approximation ealignmentG \u2248 ealignmentM despite\nthe alignment errors are different.\nThose approximations are more accurate when the\nlevels of the two pianists are closer. Then, we propose\na relative error by subtracting (4) and (5):\nr = ERG \u2212ERM \u2248 etranscriptionG.\n(6)\nThe relative error r is a rough approximation of the\ntranscription errors etranscriptionG. A lower r value indicates better transcription quality.\nTable 4 shows the alignment performance.\nThe\nmedian alignment SM, DM, IM and ERM on the MAESTRO dataset are 0.009, 0.024, 0.021 and 0.061 respectively.\nThe median alignment SG, DG, IG and\nERG on the GiantMIDI-Piano dataset are 0.015, 0.051,\n\f10\nAnonymous: GiantMIDI-Piano: A large-scale MIDI Dataset for Classical Piano Music\n0.069 and 0.154 respectively. The relative error r between MAESTRO and GiantMIDI-Piano is 0.094. The\nfirst column of Fig.\n13 shows the box plot metrics\nof MAESTRO. Some outliers are omitted from the figures for better visualization. Some outliers are mostly\ncaused by different interpretations of trills and tremolos. The second column of Fig. 13 shows the box plot\nmetrics of GiantMIDI-Piano. In GiantMIDI-Piano, Keyboard Sonata in E-Flat Major, Hob. XVI/49 composed\nby Haydn achieves the lowest ER of 0.037, while Prelude and Fugue in A-flat major, BWV 862 composed by\nBach achieves the highest ER of 0.679 (outlier beyond\nthe plot range). This underperformance is due to the\npiano is not tuned to a standard pitch with A4 of 440\nHz. The third column of Fig. 13 shows the relative ER\nbetween MAESTRO and GiantMIDI-Piano. The relative\nmedian scores of S, D, I and ER are 0.006, 0.026, 0.047\nand 0.094 respectively. Fig. 13 also shows that there\nare fewer deletions than insertions.\n6. Conclusion\nWe collect and transcribe a large-scale GiantMIDIPiano dataset containing 38,700,838 transcribed piano notes from 10,855 unique classical piano works\ncomposed by 2,786 composers.\nThe total duration\nof GiantMIDI-Piano is 1,237 hours. The curated subset contains 24,253,495 piano notes from 7,236 works\ncomposed by 1,787 composers.\nGiantMIDI-Piano is\ntranscribed from YouTube audio recordings searched\nby meta-information from IMSLP.\nThe solo piano detection system used in GiantMIDIPiano achieves an F1 score of 88.14%, and the piano\ntranscription system achieves a relative error rate of\n0.094.\nThe limitations of GiantMIDI-Piano include:\n1) There are no pitch spellings to distinguish enharmonic notes.\n2) GiantMIDI-Piano does not provide\nbeats, time signatures, key signatures, and scores. 2)\nGiantMIDI-Piano does not disentangle the music score\nand the expressive performance of pianists.\nWe have released the source code for acquiring\nGiantMIDI-Piano. In the future, GiantMIDI-Piano can\nbe used in many research areas, including but not limited to musical analysis, music generation, music information retrieval, and expressive performance analysis.\n7.

MIDI datasets have played a crucial role in advancing deep music generation research. In this section, we discuss several notable MIDI datasets that have been used for deep music generation tasks.\n\nThe KernScores dataset [REF0] contains classical music in a Humdrum format and is obtained through an optical music recognition system. It provides a valuable resource for studying classical music composition and analysis. Another dataset, Kunstderfuge [REF0], includes solo piano and non-solo piano works of 598 composers. The piano-midi.de, classical archives, and Kunstderfuge datasets are entered using a MIDI sequencer and are not played by pianists [REF0].\n\nThe MAPS dataset [REF0] utilizes MIDI files from Piano-midi.de to render real recordings by playing back the MIDI files on a Yamaha Disklavier. This dataset enables researchers to explore the relationship between MIDI representations and real piano performances. The MAESTRO dataset [REF0] contains over 200 hours of fine alignment MIDI files and audio recordings. It features virtuoso pianists performing on Yamaha Disklaviers with an integrated MIDI capture system. MAESTRO encompasses music works from 62 composers, providing a diverse and high-quality resource for deep music generation research [REF0].\n\nMIDI datasets offer various advantages for deep music generation tasks. They provide a structured representation of music, including information about pitch, duration, articulation marking, tempo, and more [REF6]. This rich set of features allows models to capture the nuances of musical expression. Additionally, MIDI datasets enable the exploration of multi-instrumental music generation by assigning notes to different instrument voices [REF3].\n\nHowever, MIDI datasets also have limitations. They often lack expressive performance features, such as absolute tempo, velocity, and articulation usage [REF6]. This can limit the ability of models to generate music with realistic and nuanced performances. Furthermore, MIDI datasets may not fully capture the intricacies of human performances, as they are often created through sequencers rather than being played by musicians [REF0].\n\nIn summary, MIDI datasets have been instrumental in advancing deep music generation research. They provide structured representations of music and enable the exploration of multi-instrumental music generation. However, they also have limitations in capturing expressive performance features. Future research should focus on addressing these limitations and developing more comprehensive and diverse MIDI datasets for deep music generation tasks.\n\n[REF0] Sapp, C. (2005).

One of the earliest datasets in this domain is the KernScores dataset, which contains classical music in Humdrum format, obtained through an optical music recognition system [REF0]. Another significant dataset is Kunstderfuge, which includes both solo and non-solo piano works from a wide range of composers, with the data entered using a MIDI sequencer rather than being performed by pianists [REF0].\n\nThe MAPS dataset takes a different approach by using MIDI files from Piano-midi.de to render real recordings on a Yamaha Disklavier, thereby providing a link between MIDI data and actual acoustic recordings [REF0]. This is further extended by the MAESTRO dataset, which contains over 200 hours of fine alignment MIDI files and audio recordings, performed by virtuoso pianists on Yamaha Disklaviers with an integrated MIDI capture system, offering a rich resource for both transcription and performance modeling [REF0].\n\nThe GiantMIDI-Piano dataset is another valuable resource, which includes a large collection of piano MIDI files. It is particularly useful for evaluating transcription performance, as it allows for the analysis of performance, transcription, and alignment errors [REF1]. This dataset can be instrumental in developing systems that can accurately transcribe piano music and understand the nuances of a pianist's performance.\n\nHowever, when dealing with music that involves multiple instruments, datasets like NES-MDB highlight the challenges of representing and generating polyphonic music, where systems must provide mechanisms for assigning notes to specific instrument voices [REF2]. This complexity necessitates the development of models that can handle separated score representations, where each instrument's voice is encoded as a monophonic sequence, allowing for explicit modeling of the relationships between different instrument voices [REF2].\n\nIn addition to the note-level information typically found in MIDI files, datasets can also include a variety of score and performance features, such as pitch, duration, articulation markings, and dynamic markings, which are essential for generating expressive music performances [REF3]. These features enable the development of sophisticated models, such as hierarchical attention networks, which can predict sequences of performance features from sequences of score features [REF3].\n\nThe challenge of creating large-scale datasets for music generation is not trivial, as evidenced by the \"million song dataset\" idea, which highlights the difficulties in collecting and sharing large music collections due to various logistical and legal challenges [REF5]. Despite these challenges, the creation of comprehensive datasets is crucial for advancing research in music information retrieval and generation.\n\nIn conclusion, MIDI datasets are indispensable for the development and evaluation of deep music generation systems. They provide the necessary data for training models to understand and generate music with various levels of complexity, from solo piano pieces to full orchestral scores. As the field progresses, the creation and refinement of these datasets will continue to be a critical area of research, enabling the development of more advanced and expressive music generation systems.", "references_sent_to_gpt": [{"title": "Giantmidi-piano: A large-scale midi dataset for classical piano music", "bibref": "BIBREF358", "authors": [{"first": "Qiuqiang", "middle": [], "last": "Kong", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Bochen", "middle": [], "last": "Li", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Jitong", "middle": [], "last": "Chen", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Yuxuan", "middle": [], "last": "Wang", "suffix": ""}], "chunk": "Giantmidi-piano: A large-scale midi dataset for classical piano music [SEP] The KernScores dataset (Sapp, 2005) contains classical music with a Humdrum format and is obtained\nby an optical music recognition system.\n The Kunstderfuge dataset (Kunstderfuge, 2002) contains solo piano and non-solo piano works of 598 composers.

To surmount these challenges, we introduce a new framework for\nlanguage model inference, \u201cTree of Thoughts\u201d (ToT), which generalizes over the\npopular \u201cChain of Thought\u201d approach to prompting language models, and enables\nexploration over coherent units of text (\u201cthoughts\u201d) that serve as intermediate steps\ntoward problem solving. ToT allows LMs to perform deliberate decision making\nby considering multiple different reasoning paths and self-evaluating choices to\ndecide the next course of action, as well as looking ahead or backtracking when\nnecessary to make global choices. Our experiments show that ToT significantly\nenhances language models\u2019 problem-solving abilities on three novel tasks requiring\nnon-trivial planning or search: Game of 24, Creative Writing, and Mini Crosswords.\nFor instance, in Game of 24, while GPT-4 with chain-of-thought prompting only\nsolved 4% of tasks, our method achieved a success rate of 74%.

It is\nperhaps surprising that underlying all this progress is still the original autoregressive mechanism for\ngenerating text, which makes token-level decisions one by one and in a left-to-right fashion. Is such\na simple mechanism sufficient for a LM to be built toward a general problem solver? If not, what\nproblems would challenge the current paradigm, and what should be alternative mechanisms?\nThe literature on human cognition provides some clues to answer these questions. Research on \u201cdual\nprocess\u201d models suggests that people have two modes in which they engage with decisions \u2013 a fast,\nautomatic, unconscious mode (\u201cSystem 1\u201d) and a slow, deliberate, conscious mode (\u201cSystem 2\u201d)\n[27, 28, 13, 12]. These two modes have previously been connected to a variety of mathematical\nmodels used in machine learning. For example, research on reinforcement learning in humans and\nother animals has explored the circumstances under which they engage in associative \u201cmodel free\u201d\nlearning or more deliberative \u201cmodel based\u201d planning [6]. The simple associative token-level choices\nof LMs are also reminiscent of \u201cSystem 1\u201d, and thus might benefit from augmentation by a more\ndeliberate \u201cSystem 2\u201d planning process that (1) maintains and explores diverse alternatives for current\nPreprint.

See concrete examples of how thoughts are generated, evaluated, and\nsearched in Figures 2,4,6.\nchoices instead of just picking one, and (2) evaluates its current status and actively looks ahead or\nbacktracks to make more global decisions.\nTo design such a planning process, we return to the origins of artificial intelligence (and cognitive\nscience), drawing inspiration from the planning processes explored by Newell, Shaw, and Simon\nstarting in the 1950s [18, 19]. Newell and colleagues characterized problem solving [18] as search\nthrough a combinatorial problem space, represented as a tree. We thus propose the Tree of Thoughts\n(ToT) framework for general problem solving with language models. As Figure 1 illustrates, while\nexisting methods (detailed below) sample continuous language sequences for problem solving, ToT\nactively maintains a tree of thoughts, where each thought is a coherent language sequence that serves\nas an intermediate step toward problem solving (Table 1). Such a high-level semantic unit allows the\nLM to self-evaluate the progress different intermediate thoughts make towards solving the problem\nthrough a deliberate reasoning process that is also instantiated in language (Figures 2,4,6). This\nimplementation of search heuristics via LM self-evaluation and deliberation is novel, as previous\nsearch heuristics are either programmed or learned. Finally, we combine this language-based\ncapability to generate and evaluate diverse thoughts with search algorithms, such as breadth-first\nsearch (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS), which allow systematic exploration of the tree of thoughts\nwith lookahead and backtracking.\nEmpirically, we propose three new problems that challenge existing LM inference methods even with\nthe state-of-the-art language model, GPT-4 [20]: Game of 24, Creative Writing, and Crosswords\n(Table 1). These tasks require deductive, mathematical, commonsense, lexical reasoning abilities,\nand a way to incorporate systematic planning or search. We show ToT obtains superior results on\nall three tasks by being general and flexible enough to support different levels of thoughts, different\nways to generate and evaluate thoughts, and different search algorithms that adapt to the nature of\ndifferent problems. We also analyze how such choices affect model performances via systematic\nablations and discuss future directions to better train and use LMs.\n2\nBackground\nWe first formalize some existing methods that use large language models for problem-solving,\nwhich our approach is inspired by and later compared with. We use p\u03b8 to denote a pre-trained LM\nwith parameters \u03b8, and lowercase letters x, y, z, s, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 to denote a language sequence, i.e. x =\n(x[1], \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , x[n]) where each x[i] is a token, so that p\u03b8(x) = \ufffdn\ni=1 p\u03b8(x[i]|x[1...i]). We use uppercase\nletters S, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 to denote a collection of language sequences.\nInput-output (IO) prompting is the most common way to turn a problem input x into output y with\nLM: y \u223c p\u03b8(y|promptIO(x)), where promptIO(x) wraps input x with task instructions and/or fewshot input-output examples. For simplicity, let us denote pprompt\n\u03b8\n(output | input) = p\u03b8(output |\nprompt(input)), so that IO prompting can be formulated as y \u223c pIO\n\u03b8 (y|x).\n2\n\fChain-of-thought (CoT) prompting [35] was proposed to address cases where the mapping of\ninput x to output y is non-trivial (e.g. when x is a math question and y is the final numerical answer).\nThe key idea is to introduce a chain of thoughts z1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , zn to bridge x and y, where each zi is a\ncoherent language sequence that serves as a meaningful intermediate step toward problem solving\n(e.g. zi could be an intermediate equation for math QA). To solve problems with CoT, each thought\nzi \u223c pCoT\n\u03b8\n(zi | x, z1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7i\u22121) is sampled sequentially, then the output y \u223c pCoT\n\u03b8\n(y|x, z1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7n). In\npractice, [z1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7n, y] \u223c pCoT\n\u03b8\n(z1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7n, y|x) is sampled as a continuous language sequence, and the\ndecomposition of thoughts (e.g. is each zi a phrase, a sentence, or a paragraph) is left ambiguous.\nSelf-consistency with CoT (CoT-SC) [33] is an ensemble approach that samples k i.i.d. chains\nof thought: [z(i)\n1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7n, y(i)] \u223c pCoT\n\u03b8\n(z1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7n, y|x) (i = 1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 k), then returns the most frequent output:\narg maxy #{i | y(i) = y}. CoT-SC improves upon CoT, because there are generally different\nthought processes for the same problem (e.g. different ways to prove the same theorem), and the\noutput decision can be more faithful by exploring a richer set of thoughts. However, within each\nchain there is no local exploration of different thought steps, and the \u201cmost frequent\u201d heuristic only\napplies when the output space is limited (e.g. multi-choice QA).\n3\nTree of Thoughts: Deliberate Problem Solving with LM\nA genuine problem-solving process involves the repeated use of available information to initiate exploration, which discloses, in turn, more information until a way\nto attain the solution is finally discovered.\u2014\u2014 Newell et al. [18]\nResearch on human problem-solving suggests that people search through a combinatorial problemspace \u2013 a tree where the nodes represent partial solutions, and the branches correspond to operators\nthat modify them [18, 19]. Which branch to take is determined by heuristics that help to navigate the\nproblem-space and guide the problem-solver towards a solution. This perspective highlights two key\nshortcomings of existing approaches that use LMs to solve general problems: 1) Locally, they do not\nexplore different continuations within a thought process \u2013 the branches of the tree. 2) Globally, they\ndo not incorporate any type of planning, lookahead, or backtracking to help evaluate these different\noptions \u2013 the kind of heuristic-guided search that seems characteristic of human problem-solving.\nTo address these shortcomings, we introduce Tree of Thoughts (ToT), a paradigm that allows LMs to\nexplore multiple reasoning paths over thoughts (Figure 1(c)). ToT frames any problem as a search\nover a tree, where each node is a state s = [x, z1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7i] representing a partial solution with the input and\nthe sequence of thoughts so far. A specific instantiation of ToT involves answering four questions:\n1. How to decompose the intermediate process into thought steps; 2. How to generate potential\nthoughts from each state; 3. How to heuristically evaluate states; 4. What search algorithm to use.\n1. Thought decomposition. While CoT samples thoughts coherently without explicit decomposition,\nToT leverages problem properties to design and decompose intermediate thought steps. As Table 1\nshows, depending on different problems, a thought could be a couple of words (Crosswords), a line of\nequation (Game of 24), or a whole paragraph of writing plan (Creative Writing). In general, a thought\nshould be \u201csmall\u201d enough so that LMs can generate promising and diverse samples (e.g. generating\na whole book is usually too \u201cbig\u201d to be coherent), yet \u201cbig\u201d enough so that LMs can evaluate its\nprospect toward problem solving (e.g. generating one token is usually too \u201csmall\u201d to evaluate).\n2. Thought generator G(p\u03b8, s, k). Given a tree state s = [x, z1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7i], we consider two strategies to\ngenerate k candidates for the next thought step:\n(a) Sample i.i.d. thoughts from a CoT prompt (Creative Writing, Figure 4):\nz(j)\n\u223c\npCoT\n\u03b8\n(zi+1|s) = pCoT\n\u03b8\n(zi+1|x, z1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7i) (j = 1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 k). This works better when the thought\nspace is rich (e.g. each thought is a paragraph), and i.i.d. samples lead to diversity;\n(b) Propose thoughts sequentially using a \u201cpropose prompt\u201d (Game of 24, Figure 2; Crosswords,\nFigure 6): [z(1), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , z(k)] \u223c ppropose\n\u03b8\n(z(1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7k)\ni+1\n| s). This works better when the thought\nspace is more constrained (e.g. each thought is just a word or a line), so proposing different\nthoughts in the same context avoids duplication.\n3. State evaluator V (p\u03b8, S). Given a frontier of different states, the state evaluator evaluates the\nprogress they make towards solving the problem, serving as a heuristic for the search algorithm\nto determine which states to keep exploring and in which order. While heuristics are a standard\napproach to solving search problems, they are typically either programmed (e.g. DeepBlue [3]) or\n3\n\flearned (e.g. AlphaGo [26]). We propose a third alternative, by using the LM to deliberately reason\nabout states. When applicable, such a deliberate heuristic can be more flexible than programmed\nrules, and more sample-efficient than learned models. Similar to the thought generator, we consider\ntwo strategies to evaluate states either independently or together:\n(a) Value each state independently: V (p\u03b8, S)(s) \u223c pvalue\n\u03b8\n(v|s) \u2200s \u2208 S, where a value\nprompt reasons about the state s to generate a scalar value v (e.g. 1-10) or a classification (e.g. sure/likely/impossible) that could be heuristically turned into a value. The basis\nof such evaluative reasoning can vary across problems and thought steps. In this work, we\nexplore evaluation via few lookahead simulations (e.g. quickly confirm that 5, 5, 14 can\nreach 24 via 5 + 5 + 14, or \u201chot l\u201d can mean \u201cinn\u201d via filling \u201ce\u201d in \u201c \u201d) plus commonsense\n(e.g. 1 2 3 are too small to reach 24, or no word can start with \u201ctzxc\u201d). While the former\nmight promote \u201cgood\u201d states, the latter could help eliminate \u201cbad\u201d states. Such valuations\ndo not need to be perfect, and only need to be approximately\n(b) Vote across states: V (p\u03b8, S)(s) = 1[s = s\u2217], where a \u201cgood\u201d state s\u2217 \u223c pvote\n\u03b8\n(s\u2217|S) is\nvoted out based on deliberately comparing different states in S in a vote prompt. When\nproblem success is harder to directly value (e.g. passage coherency), it is natural to to instead\ncompare different partial solutions and vote for the most promising one. This is similar\nin spirit to a \u201cstep-wise\u201d self-consistency strategy, i.e. cast \u201cwhich state to explore\u201d as a\nmulti-choice QA, and use LM samples to vote for it.\nFor both strategies, we could prompt the LM multiple times to aggregate the value or vote results to\ntrade time/resource/cost for more faithful/robust heuristics.\nAlgorithm 1 ToT-BFS(x, p\u03b8, G, k, V, T, b)\nRequire: Input x, LM p\u03b8, thought generator G()\n& size limit k, states evaluator V (), step limit T,\nbreadth limit b.\nS0 \u2190 {x}\nfor t = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , T do\nS\u2032\nt \u2190 {[s, z] | s \u2208 St\u22121, zt \u2208 G(p\u03b8, s, k)}\nVt \u2190 V (p\u03b8, S\u2032\nt)\nSt \u2190 arg maxS\u2282S\u2032\nt,|S|=b\n\ufffd\ns\u2208S Vt(s)\nend for\nreturn G(p\u03b8, arg maxs\u2208ST VT (s), 1)\nAlgorithm 2 ToT-DFS(s, t, p\u03b8, G, k, V, T, vth)\nRequire: Current state s, step t, LM p\u03b8, thought\ngenerator G() and size limit k, states evaluator\nV (), step limit T, threshold vth\nif t > T then record output G(p\u03b8, s, 1)\nend if\nfor s\u2032 \u2208 G(p\u03b8, s, k) do\n\u25b7 sorted candidates\nif V (p\u03b8, {s\u2032})(s) > vthres then \u25b7 pruning\nDFS(s\u2032, t + 1)\nend if\nend for\n4. Search algorithm. Finally, within the ToT framework, one can plug and play different search\nalgorithms depending on the tree structure. We explore two relatively simple search algorithms and\nleave more advanced ones (e.g. A* [9], MCTS [2]) for future work:\n(a) Breadth-first search (BFS) (Algorithm 1) maintains a set of the b most promising states\nper step. This is used for Game of 24 and Creative Writing where the tree depth is limit\n(T \u2264 3), and initial thought steps can be evaluated and pruned to a small set (b \u2264 5).\n(b) Depth-first search (DFS) (Algorithm 2) explores the most promising state first, until the\nfinal output is reached (t > T), or the state evaluator deems it impossible to solve the\nproblem from the current s (V (p\u03b8, {s})(s) \u2264 vth for a value threshold vth). In the latter\ncase, the subtree from s is pruned to trade exploration for exploitation. In both cases, DFS\nbacktracks to the parent state of s to continue exploration.\nConceptually, ToT has several benefits as a method for general problem-solving with LMs: (1) Generality. IO, CoT, CoT-SC, and self-refinement can be seen as special cases of ToT (i.e. trees of limited\ndepth and breadth; Figure 1). (2) Modularity. The base LM, as well as the thought decomposition,\ngeneration, evaluation, and search procedures can all be varied independently. (3) Adaptability.\nDifferent problem properties, LM capabilities, and resource constraints can be accommodated. (4)\nConvenience. No extra training is needed, just a pre-trained LM is sufficient. The next section will\nshow how these conceptual benefits translate to strong empirical performance in different problems.\n4\nExperiments\nWe propose three tasks that are hard even when sampling from the state-of-the-art language model,\nGPT-4 [20], using standard IO prompting or chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting.

2: ToT in a game of 24. The LM is prompted for (a) thought generation and (b) valuation.\nTask Setup. We scrape data from 4nums.com, which has 1,362 games that are sorted from easy to\nhard by human solving time, and use a subset of relatively hard games indexed 901-1,000 for testing.\nFor each task, we consider the output as success if it is a valid equation that equals 24 and uses the\ninput numbers each exactly once. We report the success rate across 100 games as the metric.\nBaselines. We use a standard input-output (IO) prompt with 5 in-context examples. For chain-ofthought (CoT) prompting, we augment each input-output pair with 3 intermediate equations, each\noperating on two remaining numbers. For example, given input \u201c4 9 10 13\u201d, the thoughts could be\n\u201c13 - 9 = 4 (left: 4 4 10); 10 - 4 = 6 (left: 4 6); 4 * 6 = 24 (left: 24)\u201d. For each game, we sample IO\nand CoT prompting for 100 times for average performance. We also consider a CoT self-consistency\nbaseline, which takes the majority output from 100 CoT samples, and an iterative-refine approach on\ntop of an IO sample for at most 10 iterations. At each iteration, the LM is conditioned on all previous\nhistory to \u201creflect on your mistakes and generate a refined answer\u201d if the output is incorrect. Note\nthat it uses groundtruth feedback signals about equation correctness.\nToT Setup. To frame Game of 24 into ToT, it is natural to decompose the thoughts into 3 steps,\neach an intermediate equation. As shown in Figure 2(a), at each tree node, we exact the \u201cleft\u201d\nnumbers and prompt the LM to propose some possible next steps. The same \u201cpropose prompt\u201d is\nused for all 3 thought steps, though it only has one example with 4 input numbers. We perform a\nbreadth-first search (BFS) in ToT, where at each step we keep the best b = 5 candidates. To perform\ndeliberate BFS in ToT, as shown in Figure 2(b), we prompt LM to evaluate each thought candidate as\n\u201csure/maybe/impossible\u201d with regard to reaching 24. The aim is to promote correct partial solutions\nthat can be verdicted within few lookahead trials, and eliminate impossible partial solutions based on\n\u201ctoo big/small\u201d commonsense, and keep the rest \u201cmaybe\u201d. We sample values 3 times for each thought.\n1Experiments were done between May 5-16, 2023.\n5\n\fMethod\nSuccess\nIO prompt\n7.3%\nCoT prompt\n4.0%\nCoT-SC (k=100)\n9.0%\nToT (ours) (b=1)\n45%\nToT (ours) (b=5)\n74%\nIO + Refine (k=10)\n27%\nIO (best of 100)\n33%\nCoT (best of 100)\n49%\nTable 2: Game of 24 Results.\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n(a) Success rate with nodes visited\nIO (best of k)\nCoT (best of k)\nToT (b=1...5)\n1\n2\n3\n4\nCorrect\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n(b) Samples failed at each step\nCoT\nToT (b=5)\nFigure 3: Game of 24 (a) scale analysis & (b) error analysis.\nResults. As shown in Table 2, IO, CoT, and CoT-SC prompting methods perform badly on the task,\nachieving only 7.3%, 4.0%, and 9.0% success rates. In contrast, ToT with a breadth of b = 1 already\nachieves a success rate of 45%, while b = 5 achieves 74%. We also consider an oracle setup for\nIO/CoT, by calculating the success rate using best of k samples (1 \u2264 k \u2264 100). To compare IO/CoT\n(best of k) with ToT, we consider calculating the tree nodes visited per task in ToT across b = 1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 5,\nand map the 5 success rates in Figure 3(a), treating IO/CoT (best of k) as visiting k nodes in a bandit.\nNot surprisingly, CoT scales better than IO, and best of 100 CoT samples achieve a success rate of\n49%, but still much worse than exploring more nodes in ToT (b > 1).\nError Analysis. Figure 3(b) breaks down at which step CoT and ToT samples fail the task, i.e. the\nthought (in CoT) or all b thoughts (in ToT) are invalid or impossible to reach 24. Notably, around\n60% of CoT samples already failed the task after generating the first step, or equivalently, the first\nthree words (e.g. \u201c4 + 9\u201d). This highlights the issues with direct left-to-right decoding.\n4.2\nCreative writing\nNext, we invent a creative writing task where the input is 4 random sentences and the output should\nbe a coherent passage with 4 paragraphs that end in the 4 input sentences respectively. Such a task is\nopen-ended and exploratory, and challenges creative thinking as well as high-level planning.\nTask setup. We sample random sentences from randomwordgenerator.com to form 100 inputs, and\nthere is no groundtruth passage for each input constraint. As we find that GPT-4 can follow the\ninput constraints most of the time, we focus on evaluating passage coherency in two ways: using a\nGPT-4 zero-shot prompt to provide a 1-10 scalar score, or using human judgments to compare pairs\nof outputs from different methods. For the former, we sample 5 scores and average them for each task\noutput, and we find these 5 scores usually consistent, with a standard deviation of around 0.56 on\naverage across outputs. For the latter, we employ a subset of the authors in a blind study to compare\nthe coherency of CoT vs. ToT generated passage pairs, where the order of passages is random flipped\nover 100 inputs.\nBaselines. Given the creative nature of the task, both IO and CoT prompts are zero-shot. While the\nformer prompts the LM to directly generate a coherent passage given input constraints, the latter\nprompts the LM to first make a brief plan then write the passage, i.e. the plan serves as the intermediate\nthought step. We generate 10 IO and CoT samples per task. We also consider an iterative-refine\n(k \u2264 5) method on top of a random IO sample for each task, where the LM is conditioned on input\nconstraints and the last generated passage to decide if the passage is already \u201cperfectly coherent\u201d,\nand if not generate a refined one.\nToT setup. We build a ToT with depth 2 (and only 1 intermediate thought step) \u2014 the LM first\ngenerates k = 5 plans and votes for the best one (Figure 4), then similarly generate k = 5 passages\nbased on the best plan then vote for the best one. Here the breadth limit b = 1, as only one choice is\nkept per step. A simple zero-shot vote prompt (\u201canalyze choices below, then conclude which is most\npromising for the instruction\u201d) is used to sample 5 votes at both steps.\nResults. Figure 5(a) shows average GPT-4 scores across 100 tasks, where ToT (7.56) is deemed to\ngenerate more coherent passages than IO (6.19) and CoT (6.93) on average. While such an automatic\nmetric might be noisy, Figure 5(b) confirms the finding by showing that humans prefer ToT over\nCoT in 41 out of 100 passage pairs, while only prefer CoT over ToT in 21 (other 38 pairs are found\n\u201csimilarly coherent\u201d). Lastly, iterative-refine is more effective on this natural language task,

As\nwe observe adjacent games contain similar clues, we use 20 games with indices 1, 6, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 91, 96 for\ntesting, and games 136, 141, 146, 151, 156 for prompting. For each task, the input describes the 5\nhorizontal clues and 5 vertical clues, and the output should be a board of 5 \u00d7 5 = 25 letters to solve\nthe crosswords. For evaluation, we consider three levels of success: the portion of correct letters (25\nper game), words (10 per game), and games.\nBaselines. We provide 5 example input-output pairs in the IO prompt, and in the CoT prompt\nadditionally include intermediate words in the order h1..5 then v1..5. We run each prompt for 10\nsamples and average the results.\nToT Setup. We leverage a depth-first search (Algorithm 2) that keeps exploring the most promising\nsubsequent word clue until the state is no longer promising, then backtrack to the parent state to\nexplore alternative thoughts. To make search tractable, subsequent thoughts are constrained not to\nchange any filled words or letters, so that the ToT has at most 10 intermediate steps. For thought\ngeneration, at each state we translate all existing thoughts (e.g. \u201ch2.motor; h1.tasks\u201d for the state\nin Figure 6(a)) into letter constraints for remaining clues (e.g. \u201cv1.To heap: tm\n;...\u201d) and prompt\na proposal prompt 5 times to come up with candidates for where and what to fill in the next word.\nImportantly, we also prompt the LM to give a confidence level for different thoughts, and aggregate\n7\n\f\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\nFigure 6: In Mini Crosswords, (a) how thoughts are proposed and aggregated in a priority queue\nfor depth-first search (DFS), and (b) how a state is evaluated based on the possibility of filling in\neach remaining word clue, and pruned if any remaining clue is deemed not possible to fill by the LM.\nThen DFS backtracks to the parent state and explore the next promising thought for clue.\nthese across proposals to obtain a sorted list of next thoughts to explore (Figure 6(a)). For state\nevaluations, we similarly translate each state into letter constraints for remaining clues, then evaluate\nfor each clue if it is possible to fill given the constraints. If any remaining clue is deemed \u201cimpossible\u201d\nto fill in (e.g. \u201cv1. To heap: tm s \u201d), then the exploration of the state\u2019s subtree is pruned and DFS\nbacktracks to its parent to explore the next promising thought. We limit DFS search steps to 100, and\nsimply render the deepest explored state (the first explored one if multiple) into the final output.\nResults. As shown in Table 3, IO and CoT prompting methods perform poorly with a word-level\nsuccess rate less than 16%, while ToT significantly improves all metrics, achieving a word-level\nsuccess rate of 60% and solving 4 out of 20 games. Such an improvement is not surprising, given IO\nand CoT lack mechanisms to try different clues, make changes to decisions, or backtrack.\nOracle and ablation studies. When outputting from the oracle best DFS state (instead of the\nheuristically determined best state) per task, ToT performance is even higher and actually solves\n7/20 games (Table 3, \u201c+best state\u201d), indicating our simple output heuristics can be readily improved.\nInterestingly, sometimes when the crosswords game is actually solved, the state evaluator might still\ndeem some words as \u201cimpossible\u201d and prune \u2014 possibly because 5 \u00d7 5 crosswords by design have\nsome rare or obselete words that GPT-4 cannot recognize2. Given the state evaluation as a pruning\nheuristic is imperfect, we also explore ablating the pruning, and find the performance generally worse\n(Table 3, \u201c-prune\u201d). However, it could actually find the correct solution for 4/20 games (though only\noutputting 1 via heuristic), 3 of which are games ToT+pruning cannot solve within 100 steps. Thus,\nbetter heuristics for DFS pruning are critical for problem solving in this case. Lastly, we confirm the\nimportance of backtracking by running an ablation that keeps filling the most promising clue for at\nmost 20 steps, allowing overwrites. This is similar to a \u201cgreedy\u201d BFS search with breadth limit of\nb = 1, and performs poorly with a word level success of only 20% (Table 3, \u201c-backtrack\u201d).\n5\nRelated Work\nPlanning and decision making. Smart planning and decision making are critical to achieving\npredefined goals. As they are trained on vast amount of world knowledge and human examples, LMs\nare known to have already absorbed rich commonsense that makes it possible to propose reasonable\nplans conditioned on problem setting and environmental states [10, 39, 34, 11, 32, 38, 37]. Our\nproposed Tree-of-Thought approach extends existing planning formulations by considering multiple\npotentially feasible plans simultaneously at each problem-solving step, and proceeding with the most\npromising ones. The integration between thought sampling and value feedback organically integrates\nplanning and decision-making mechanisms, enabling effective search inside a solution tree. On the\nother hand, traditional decision-making procedures usually require training dedicated reward and\npolicy models as in reinforcement learning (for example CHAI [30]), whereas we use the LM itself\nto provide the value estimates for decision making.\n2For example, \u201cagend\u201d is an obsolete form of \u201cagendum\u201d, but GPT-4 deems it a typo for \u201cagenda\u201d. External\nretrieval or web interaction could augment LM for problem solving under knowledge uncertainty.\n8\n\fSelf-reflection. Using LLMs to assess the viability of their own predictions is becoming an increasingly important procedure in problem solving. [25, 17, 21] introduced the \u201cself-reflection\u201d\nmechanism, in which LMs provide feedback to their generation candidates. [4] improves LMs code\ngeneration accuracy by injecting feedback messages generated by the LM itself based on its code\nexecution results. Similarly, [14] also introduces \u201ccritic\u201d or review steps over the actions and states,\ndeciding the next action to take in solving computer operation tasks. Another recent work very\nrelevant to ours is \u201cself-eval guided decoding\u201d [36]. Similar to our method, self-eval decoding\nalso follows a tree-search procedure with leaves sampled from stochastic beam search decoding,\nwhich are then evaluated by LLM itself with carefully prepared self-eval prompts. Their approach\nhowever, uses the PAL formulation [7] which represents thoughts as codes, which makes it difficult\nto tackle challenging tasks like creative writing which we consider in this paper. Our Tree-of-Thought\nformulation is thus more versatile and handles challenging tasks on which GPT-4 only achieves very\nlow accuracy with standard prompts.\nProgram-guided LLM generation. Our proposal is also related to recent advancements that organize LM\u2019s behavior with symbolic program guidance. For example [24] embeds LMs in an\nalgorithmic search procedure to help solve problems like question answering step-by-step, in which\nthe search trees are expanded by relevant paragraphs that might provide answers. This approach\nhowever differs from ours in that trees are expanded by sampling external paragraphs instead of the\nLM\u2019s own thoughts, and there is no reflection or voting steps. Another approach, LLM+P [15], goes\none step further and delegates the actual planning process to a classical planner.\nClassical search methods. Last but not least, our approach can be treated as a modern rendition\nof classical search methods for problem solving. For example it can be considered as a heuristic\nsearch algorithm like A* [8], in which the heuristic at each search node is provided by the LM\u2019s\nself-assessment. From this perspective, our method is also related to NeuroLogic A*esque decoding\nproposed in [16], which is inspired by A* search but introduces look-ahead heuristics that are\nefficient for LMs to improve the beam-search or top-k sampling decoding. This method however is\nconstrained to sentence generation tasks, whereas our framework are designed for complex, multi-step\nproblem solving guarded by value feedback.\n6\nDiscussion\nLimitations and future directions. Deliberate search such as ToT might not be necessary for\nmany existing tasks that GPT-4 already excels at, and as an initial step this work only explores\nthree relatively simple tasks that challenges GPT-4 and calls of better search and planning abilities\nincorporated with LMs. However, as we begin to deploy LMs for more real-world decision making\napplications (e.g. coding, data analysis, robotics, etc.), more complex tasks could emerge and present\nnew opportunities to study these research questions. Also, search methods like ToT requires more\nresources (e.g. GPT-4 API cost) than sampling methods in order to improve task performances,\nbut the modular flexibility of ToT allows users to customize such performance-cost tradeoffs, and\nongoing open-source efforts [29] should readily reduce such costs in the near future. Lastly, this work\nfocuses on using an off-the-shelf LM, and fine-tuning LMs using a ToT-style high-level counterfactual\ndecision making (e.g. deliberating over potential choices for the next paragraph, instead of predicting\nthe next token) might present opportunities to enhance the problem-solving capabilities of LMs.\nBroader impact. ToT is a framework that empowers LMs to more autonomously and intelligently\nmake decisions and solve problems. While current tasks are limited to reasoning and search problems,\nfuture applications involving interaction with external environments or humans could bring potential\ndanger, e.g. facilitating harmful uses of LMs. On the other hand, ToT also improves the interpretability\nof model decisions and the opportunity for human alignment, as the resulting representations are\nreadable, high-level language reasoning instead of implicit, low-level token values.\nConclusion. The associative \u201cSystem 1\u201d of LMs can be beneficially augmented by a \u201cSystem 2\u201d\nbased on searching a tree of possible paths to the solution to a problem. The Tree of Thoughts\nframework provides a way to translate classical insights about problem-solving into actionable\nmethods for contemporary LMs. At the same time, LMs address a weakness of these classical\nmethods, providing a way to solve complex problems that are not easily formalized, such as creative\nwriting. We see this intersection of LMs with classical approaches to AI as an exciting direction for\nfuture work.\n9\n\fReferences\n[1] T. Brown, B. Mann, N. Ryder, M. Subbiah, J. D. Kaplan, P. Dhariwal, A.

This means they can fall short in tasks that require exploration, strategic lookahead, or where initial decisions play a pivotal role. To surmount these challenges, we introduce a new framework for language model inference, \"Tree of Thoughts\" (ToT), which generalizes over the popular \"Chain of Thought\" approach to prompting language models, and enables exploration over coherent units of text (\"thoughts\") that serve as intermediate steps toward problem solving. ToT allows LMs to perform deliberate decision making by considering multiple different reasoning paths and self-evaluating choices to decide the next course of action, as well as looking ahead or backtracking when necessary to make global choices. Our experiments show that ToT significantly enhances language models' problem-solving abilities on three novel tasks requiring non-trivial planning or search: Game of 24, Creative Writing, and Mini Crosswords. For instance, in Game of 24, while GPT-4 with chain-of-thought prompting only solved 4% of tasks, our method achieved a success rate of 74%. Code repo with all prompts: [https://github.com/ysmyth/tree-of-thought-llm](https://github.com/ysmyth/tree-of-thought-llm).\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nOriginally designed to generate text, scaled-up versions of language models (LMs) such as GPT [22; 23; 1; 20] and PaLM [5] have been shown to be increasingly capable of performing an ever wider range of tasks requiring mathematical, symbolic, commonsense, and knowledge reasoning. It is perhaps surprising that underlying all this progress is still the original autoregressive mechanism for generating text, which makes token-level decisions one by one and in a left-to-right fashion. Is such a simple mechanism sufficient for a LM to be built toward a general problem solver? If not, what problems would challenge the current paradigm, and what should be alternative mechanisms?\n\nThe literature on human cognition provides some clues to answer these questions. Research on \"dual process\" models suggests that people have two modes in which they engage with decisions - a fast, automatic, unconscious mode (\"System 1\") and a slow, deliberate, conscious mode (\"System 2\") [27; 28; 13; 12]. These two modes have previously been connected to a variety of mathematical models used in machine learning. For example, research on reinforcement learning in humans and other animals has explored the circumstances under which they engage in associative \"model free\" learning or more deliberative \"model based\" planning [6]. The simple associative token-level choices of LMs are also reminiscent of \"System 1\", and thus might benefit from augmentation by a more deliberate \"System 2\" planning process that (1) maintains and explores diverse alternatives for currentchoices instead of just picking one, and (2) evaluates its current status and actively looks ahead or backtracks to make more global decisions.\n\nTo design such a planning process, we return to the origins of artificial intelligence (and cognitive science), drawing inspiration from the planning processes explored by Newell, Shaw, and Simon starting in the 1950s [18; 19]. Newell and colleagues characterized problem solving [18] as search through a combinatorial problem space, represented as a tree. We thus propose the Tree of Thoughts (ToT) framework for general problem solving with language models. As Figure 1 illustrates, while existing methods (detailed below) sample continuous language sequences for problem solving, ToT actively maintains a tree of thoughts, where each _thought_ is a coherent language sequence that serves as an intermediate step toward problem solving (Table 1). Such a high-level semantic unit allows the LM to self-evaluate the progress different intermediate thoughts make towards solving the problem through a deliberate reasoning process that is also instantiated in language (Figures 2,4,6). This implementation of search heuristics via LM self-evaluation and deliberation is novel, as previous search heuristics are either programmed or learned. Finally, we combine this language-based capability to generate and evaluate diverse thoughts with search algorithms, such as breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS), which allow systematic exploration of the tree of thoughts with lookahead and backtracking.\n\nEmpirically, we propose three new problems that challenge existing LM inference methods even with the state-of-the-art language model, GPT-4 [20]: Game of 24, Creative Writing, and Crosswords (Table 1). These tasks require deductive, mathematical, commonsense, lexical reasoning abilities, and a way to incorporate systematic planning or search. We show ToT obtains superior results on all three tasks by being general and flexible enough to support different levels of thoughts, different ways to generate and evaluate thoughts, and different search algorithms that adapt to the nature of different problems. We also analyze how such choices affect model performances via systematic ablations and discuss future directions to better train and use LMs.\n\n## 2 Background\n\nWe first formalize some existing methods that use large language models for problem-solving, which our approach is inspired by and later compared with. We use \\(p_{\\theta}\\) to denote a pre-trained LM with parameters \\(\\theta\\), and **lowercase letters \\(x,y,z,s,\\cdots\\) to denote a language sequence**, i.e. \\(x=(x[1],\\cdots,x[n])\\) where each \\(x[i]\\) is a token, so that \\(p_{\\theta}(x)=\\prod_{i=1}^{n}p_{\\theta}(x[i]|x[1...i])\\). We use uppercase letters \\(S,\\cdots\\) to denote a collection of language sequences.\n\n**Input-output (IO) prompting** is the most common way to turn a problem input \\(x\\) into output \\(y\\) with LM: \\(y\\sim p_{\\theta}(y|\\texttt{prompt}_{IO}(x))\\), where \\(\\texttt{prompt}_{IO}(x)\\) wraps input \\(x\\) with task instructions and/or few-shot input-output examples. For simplicity, let us denote \\(p_{\\theta}^{\\text{prompt}}(\\texttt{output}\\mid\\texttt{input})=p_{\\theta}( \\texttt{output}\\mid\\texttt{prompt}(\\texttt{input}))\\), so that IO prompting can be formulated as \\(y\\sim p_{\\theta}^{IO}(y|x)\\).\n\nFigure 1: Schematic illustrating various approaches to problem solving with LLMs. Each rectangle box represents a _thought_, which is a coherent language sequence that serves as an intermediate step toward problem solving. See concrete examples of how thoughts are generated, evaluated, and searched in Figures 2,4,6.\n\n**Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting**[35] was proposed to address cases where the mapping of input \\(x\\) to output \\(y\\) is non-trivial (e.g. when \\(x\\) is a math question and \\(y\\) is the final numerical answer). The key idea is to introduce a chain of _thoughts_\\(z_{1},\\cdots,z_{n}\\) to bridge \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), where each \\(z_{i}\\) is a coherent language sequence that serves as a meaningful intermediate step toward problem solving (e.g. \\(z_{i}\\) could be an intermediate equation for math QA). To solve problems with CoT, each thought \\(z_{i}\\sim p_{\\theta}^{CoT}(z_{i}\\mid x,z_{1\\dots i-1})\\) is sampled sequentially, then the output \\(y\\sim p_{\\theta}^{CoT}(y|x,z_{1\\dots n})\\). In practice, \\([z_{1\\dots n},y]\\sim p_{\\theta}^{CoT}(z_{1\\dots n},y|x)\\) is sampled as a continuous language sequence, and the **decomposition** of thoughts (e.g. is each \\(z_{i}\\) a phrase, a sentence, or a paragraph) is left ambiguous.\n\n**Self-consistency with CoT (CoT-SC)**[33] is an ensemble approach that samples \\(k\\) i.i.d. chains of thought: \\([z_{1\\dots n}^{(i)},y^{(i)}]\\sim p_{\\theta}^{CoT}(z_{1\\dots n},y|x)\\) (\\(i=1\\cdots k\\)), then returns the most frequent output: \\(\\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{y}\\#\\{i\\mid y^{(i)}=y\\}\\). CoT-SC improves upon CoT, because there are generally different thought processes for the same problem (e.g. different ways to prove the same theorem), and the output decision can be more faithful by exploring a richer set of thoughts. However, within each chain there is no local exploration of different thought steps, and the \"most frequent\" heuristic only applies when the output space is limited (e.g. multi-choice QA).\n\n## 3 Tree of Thoughts: Deliberate Problem Solving with LM\n\n_A genuine problem-solving process involves the repeated use of available information to initiate exploration, which discloses, in turn, more information until a way to attain the solution is finally discovered._----_Newell et al._[18]\n\nResearch on human problem-solving suggests that people search through a combinatorial problem-space - a tree where the nodes represent partial solutions, and the branches correspond to operators that modify them [18, 19]. Which branch to take is determined by heuristics that help to navigate the problem-space and guide the problem-solver towards a solution. This perspective highlights two key shortcomings of existing approaches that use LMs to solve general problems: 1) Locally, they do not explore _different_ continuations within a thought process - the branches of the tree. 2) Globally, they do not incorporate any type of planning, lookahead, or backtracking to help evaluate these different options - the kind of heuristic-guided search that seems characteristic of human problem-solving.\n\nTo address these shortcomings, we introduce _Tree of Thoughts (ToT)_, a paradigm that allows LMs to explore multiple reasoning paths over thoughts (Figure 1(c)). ToT frames any problem as a search over a tree, where each node is a **state**\\(s=[x,z_{1\\dots i}]\\) representing a partial solution with the input and the sequence of thoughts so far. A specific instantiation of ToT involves answering four questions: 1. How to **decompose** the intermediate process into thought steps; 2. How to **generate** potential thoughts from each state; 3. How to heuristically **evaluate** states; 4. What **search** algorithm to use.\n\n**1. Thought decomposition.** While CoT samples thoughts coherently without explicit decomposition, ToT leverages problem properties to design and decompose intermediate thought steps. As Table 1 shows, depending on different problems, a thought could be a couple of words (Crosswords), a line of equation (Game of 24), or a whole paragraph of writing plan (Creative Writing). In general, a thought should be \"small\" enough so that LMs can generate promising and diverse samples (e.g. generating a whole book is usually too \"big\" to be coherent), yet \"big\" enough so that LMs can evaluate its prospect toward problem solving (e.g. generating one token is usually too \"small\" to evaluate).\n\n**2. Thought generator \\(G(p_{\\theta},s,k)\\).** Given a tree state \\(s=[x,z_{1\\dots i}]\\), we consider two strategies to generate \\(k\\) candidates for the next thought step:\n\n1. **Sample** i.i.d. thoughts from a CoT prompt (Creative Writing, Figure 4): \\(z^{(j)}\\sim p_{\\theta}^{CoT}(z_{i+1}|s)=p_{\\theta}^{CoT}(z_{i+1}|x,z_{1\\dots i} )\\) (\\(j=1\\cdots k\\)). This works better when the thought space is rich (e.g. each thought is a paragraph), and i.i.d. samples lead to diversity;\n2. **Propose** thoughts sequentially using a \"propose prompt\" (Game of 24, Figure 2; Crosswords, Figure 6): \\([z^{(1)},\\cdots,z^{(k)}]\\sim p_{\\theta}^{propose}(z_{i+1}^{(1\\dots k)}\\mid s)\\). This works better when the thought space is more constrained (e.g. each thought is just a word or a line), so proposing different thoughts in the same context avoids duplication.\n\n**3. State evaluator \\(V(p_{\\theta},S)\\).** Given a frontier of different states, the state evaluator evaluates the progress they make towards solving the problem, serving as a _heuristic_ for the search algorithm to determine which states to keep exploring and in which order. While heuristics are a standard approach to solving search problems, they are typically either programmed (e.g. DeepBlue [3]) orlearned (e.g. AlphaGo [26]). We propose a third alternative, by using the LM to deliberately reason about states. When applicable, such a deliberate heuristic can be more flexible than programmed rules, and more sample-efficient than learned models. Similar to the thought generator, we consider two strategies to evaluate states either independently or together:\n\n1. **Value** each state independently: \\(V(p_{\\theta},S)(s)\\sim p_{\\theta}^{value}(v|s)\\ \\forall s\\in S\\), where a value prompt reasons about the state \\(s\\) to generate a scalar value \\(v\\) (e.g. 1-10) or a classification (e.g. sure/likely/impossible) that could be heuristically turned into a value. The basis of such evaluative reasoning can vary across problems and thought steps. In this work, we explore evaluation via few _lookahead_ simulations (e.g. quickly confirm that 5, 5, 14 can reach 24 via 5 + 5 + 14, or \"hot_l\" can mean \"inn\" via filling \"e\" in \"_\"_\") plus commonsense (e.g. 1 2 3 are too small to reach 24, or no word can start with \"tzxc\"). While the former might promote \"good\" states, the latter could help eliminate \"bad\" states. Such valuations do not need to be perfect, and only need to be approximately\n2. **Vote** across states: \\(V(p_{\\theta},S)(s)=\\mathds{1}[s=s^{*}]\\), where a \"good\" state \\(s^{*}\\sim p_{\\theta}^{vote}(s^{*}|S)\\) is voted out based on deliberately comparing different states in \\(S\\) in a vote prompt. When problem success is harder to directly value (e.g. passage coherency), it is natural to to instead compare different partial solutions and vote for the most promising one. This is similar in spirit to a \"step-wise\" self-consistency strategy, i.e. cast \"which state to explore\" as a multi-choice QA, and use LM samples to vote for it.\n\nFor both strategies, we could prompt the LM multiple times to aggregate the value or vote results to trade time/resource/cost for more faithful/robust heuristics.\n\n```\nInput \\(x\\), LM \\(p_{\\theta}\\), thought generator \\(G()\\) & size limit \\(k\\), states evaluator \\(V()\\), step limit \\(T\\), breadth limit \\(b\\). \\(S_{0}\\leftarrow\\{x\\}\\) for\\(t=1,\\cdots,T\\)do \\(S^{\\prime}_{t}\\leftarrow\\{[s,z]\\ |\\ s\\in S_{t-1},z_{t}\\in\\mathrm{G}(p_{ \\theta},s,k)\\}\\) \\(V_{t}\\gets V(p_{\\theta},S^{\\prime}_{t})\\) \\(S_{t}\\leftarrow\\arg\\max_{S\\subset S^{\\prime}_{t},|S|=b}\\sum_{s\\in S}V_{t}(s)\\) endfor return\\(G(p_{\\theta},\\arg\\max_{s\\in S_{T}}V_{T}(s),1)\\)\n```\n\n**Algorithm 1** ToT-BFS(\\(x,p_{\\theta},G,k,V,T,b\\))\n\n## 4 Search algorithm.\n\nFinally, within the ToT framework, one can plug and play different search algorithms depending on the tree structure. We explore two relatively simple search algorithms and leave more advanced ones (e.g. A* [9], MCTS [2]) for future work:\n\n1. **Breadth-first search (BFS)** (Algorithm 1) maintains a set of the \\(b\\) most promising states per step. This is used for Game of 24 and Creative Writing where the tree depth is limit (\\(T\\leq 3\\)), and initial thought steps can be evaluated and pruned to a small set (\\(b\\leq 5\\)).\n2. **Depth-first search (DFS)** (Algorithm 2) explores the most promising state first, until the final output is reached (\\(t>T\\)), or the state evaluator deems it impossible to solve the problem from the current \\(s\\) (\\(V(p_{\\theta},\\{s\\})(s)\\leq v_{th}\\) for a value threshold \\(v_{th}\\)). In the latter case, the subtree from \\(s\\) is pruned to trade exploration for exploitation. In both cases, DFS _backtracks_ to the parent state of \\(s\\) to continue exploration.\n\nConceptually, ToT has several benefits as a method for general problem-solving with LMs: (1) _Generality_. IO, CoT, CoT-SC, and self-refinement can be seen as special cases of ToT (i.e. trees of limited depth and breadth; Figure 1). (2) _Modularity_. The base LM, as well as the thought decomposition, generation, evaluation, and search procedures can all be varied independently. (3) _Adaptability_. Different problem properties, LM capabilities, and resource constraints can be accommodated. (4) _Convenience_. No extra training is needed, just a pre-trained LM is sufficient. The next section will show how these conceptual benefits translate to strong empirical performance in different problems.\n\n## 4 Experiments\n\nWe propose three tasks that are hard even when sampling from the state-of-the-art language model, GPT-4 [20], using standard IO prompting or chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. We show how deliberate search in trees of thoughts (ToT) produces better results, and more importantly, interesting and promising new ways to use language models to solve problems requiring search or planning. Unless otherwise stated, we perform experiments using a Chat Completion mode GPT-41 with a sampling temperature of 0.7.\n\nFootnote 1: Experiments were done between May 5-16, 2023.\n\n### Game of 24\n\nGame of 24 is a mathematical reasoning challenge, where the goal is to use 4 numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+-*/) to obtain 24. For example, given input \"4 9 10 13\", a solution output could be \"(10 - 4) * (13 - 9) = 24\".\n\n**Task Setup.** We scrape data from 4nums.com, which has 1,362 games that are sorted from easy to hard by human solving time, and use a subset of relatively hard games indexed 901-1,000 for testing. For each task, we consider the output as success if it is a valid equation that equals 24 and uses the input numbers each exactly once. We report the success rate across 100 games as the metric.\n\n**Baselines.** We use a standard input-output (IO) prompt with 5 in-context examples. For chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, we augment each input-output pair with 3 intermediate equations, each operating on two remaining numbers. For example, given input \"4 9 10 13\", the thoughts could be \"13 - 9 = 4 (left: 4 4 10); 10 - 4 = 6 (left: 4 6); 4 * 6 = 24 (left: 24)\". For each game, we sample IO and CoT prompting for 100 times for average performance. We also consider a CoT self-consistency baseline, which takes the majority output from 100 CoT samples, and an iterative-refine approach on top of an IO sample for at most \\(10\\) iterations. At each iteration, the LM is conditioned on all previous history to \"reflect on your mistakes and generate a refined answer\" if the output is incorrect. Note that it uses groundtruth feedback signals about equation correctness.\n\n**ToT Setup.** To frame Game of 24 into ToT, it is natural to decompose the thoughts into 3 steps, each an intermediate equation. As shown in Figure 2(a), at each tree node, we exact the \"left\" numbers and prompt the LM to propose some possible next steps. The same \"propose prompt\" is used for all 3 thought steps, though it only has one example with 4 input numbers. We perform a breadth-first search (BFS) in ToT, where at each step we keep the best \\(b=5\\) candidates. To perform deliberate BFS in ToT, as shown in Figure 2(b), we prompt LM to evaluate each thought candidate as \"sure/maybe/impossible\" with regard to reaching 24. The aim is to promote correct partial solutions that can be verdicted within few lookahead trials, and eliminate impossible partial solutions based on \"too big/small\" commonsense, and keep the rest \"maybe\". We sample values \\(3\\) times for each thought.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l|l l l} \\hline \\hline  & **Game of 24** & **Creative Writing** & **5x5 Crosswords** \\\\ \\hline\n**Input** & 4 numbers (4 9 10 13) & 4 random sentences & 10 clues (h1.presented;..) \\\\ \\hline\n**Output** & An equation to reach 24 (13-9)*(10-4)=24 & A passage of 4 paragraphs ending in the 4 sentences & 5x5 letters: SHOWN; WIRRA; AVAIL;... \\\\ \\hline\n**Thoughts** & 3 intermediate equations (13-9=4 (left 4,4,10); 10-4=6 (left 4,6); 4*6=24) & A short writing plan (1.

Input, output, thought examples are in blue.\n\nFigure 2: ToT in a game of 24. The LM is prompted for (a) thought generation and (b) valuation.\n\n**Results.** As shown in Table 2, IO, CoT, and CoT-SC prompting methods perform badly on the task, achieving only 7.3%, 4.0%, and 9.0% success rates. In contrast, ToT with a breadth of \\(b=1\\) already achieves a success rate of \\(45\\%\\), while \\(b=5\\) achieves \\(74\\%\\). We also consider an oracle setup for IO/CoT, by calculating the success rate using best of \\(k\\) samples (\\(1\\leq k\\leq 100\\)). To compare IO/CoT (best of k) with ToT, we consider calculating the tree nodes visited per task in ToT across \\(b=1\\cdots 5\\), and map the 5 success rates in Figure 3(a), treating IO/CoT (best of \\(k\\)) as visiting \\(k\\) nodes in a bandit. Not surprisingly, CoT scales better than IO, and best of 100 CoT samples achieve a success rate of \\(49\\%\\), but still much worse than exploring more nodes in ToT (\\(b>1\\)).\n\n**Error Analysis.** Figure 3(b) breaks down at which step CoT and ToT samples fail the task, i.e. the thought (in CoT) or all \\(b\\) thoughts (in ToT) are invalid or impossible to reach 24. Notably, around 60% of CoT samples already failed the task after generating the first step, or equivalently, the first three words (e.g. \"\\(4+9\\)\"). This highlights the issues with direct left-to-right decoding.\n\n### Creative writing\n\nNext, we invent a creative writing task where the input is 4 random sentences and the output should be a coherent passage with 4 paragraphs that end in the 4 input sentences respectively. Such a task is open-ended and exploratory, and challenges creative thinking as well as high-level planning.\n\n**Task setup.** We sample random sentences from randomwordgenerator.com to form 100 inputs, and there is no groundtruth passage for each input constraint. As we find that GPT-4 can follow the input constraints most of the time, we focus on evaluating passage coherency in two ways: using a GPT-4 zero-shot prompt to provide a 1-10 scalar score, or using human judgments to compare pairs of outputs from different methods. For the former, we sample 5 scores and average them for each task output, and we find these 5 scores usually consistent, with a standard deviation of around \\(0.56\\) on average across outputs. For the latter, we employ a subset of the authors in a blind study to compare the coherency of CoT vs. ToT generated passage pairs, where the order of passages is random flipped over 100 inputs.\n\n**Baselines.** Given the creative nature of the task, both IO and CoT prompts are zero-shot. While the former prompts the LM to directly generate a coherent passage given input constraints, the latter prompts the LM to first make a brief plan then write the passage, i.e. the plan serves as the intermediate thought step. We generate 10 IO and CoT samples per task. We also consider an iterative-refine (\\(k\\leq 5\\)) method on top of a random IO sample for each task, where the LM is conditioned on input constraints and the last generated passage to decide if the passage is already \"perfectly coherent\", and if not generate a refined one.\n\n**ToT setup.** We build a ToT with depth 2 (and only 1 intermediate thought step) -- the LM first generates \\(k=5\\) plans and votes for the best one (Figure 4), then similarly generate \\(k=5\\) passages based on the best plan then vote for the best one. Here the breadth limit \\(b=1\\), as only one choice is kept per step. A simple zero-shot vote prompt (\"analyze choices below, then conclude which is most promising for the instruction\") is used to sample 5 votes at both steps.\n\n**Results.** Figure 5(a) shows average GPT-4 scores across 100 tasks, where ToT (7.56) is deemed to generate more coherent passages than IO (6.19) and CoT (6.93) on average. While such an automatic metric might be noisy, Figure 5(b) confirms the finding by showing that humans prefer ToT over CoT in 41 out of 100 passage pairs, while only prefer CoT over ToT in 21 (other 38 pairs are found \"similarly coherent\"). Lastly, iterative-refine is more effective on this natural language task, where\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c} \\hline \\hline\n**Method** & **Success** \\\\ \\hline IO prompt & 7.3\\% \\\\ CoT prompt & 4.0\\% \\\\ CoT-SC (k=100) & 9.0\\% \\\\ ToT (ours) (b=1) & 45\\% \\\\ ToT (ours) (b=5) & **74\\%** \\\\ \\hline IO + Refine (k=10) & 27\\% \\\\ IO (best of 100) & 33\\% \\\\ CoT (best of 100) & 49\\% \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 2: Game of 24 Results. Figure 3: Game of 24 (a) scale analysis & (b) error analysis.\n\nit improves IO coherency score from 6.19 to 7.67, and ToT coherency score from 7.56 to 7.91. We believe it could be thought of as a third approach to thought generation in the ToT framework, where new thoughts can arise from refining old thoughts instead of i.i.d. or sequentially generated.\n\n### Mini Crosswords\n\nIn Game of 24 and Creative Writing, ToT is relatively shallow -- at most 3 thought steps are needed to reach the final output. Here we explore \\(5\\times 5\\) mini crosswords as a harder search problem involving natural language. Again, the goal is not just to solve the task, as more general crosswords can be readily solved with specialized NLP pipelines [31] that leverages large-scale retrieval instead of LM. Rather, we aim to explore the limit of LM as a general problem solver that explores its own thoughts and guides its own exploration with deliberate reasoning as heuristics.\n\n**Task Setup.** We scrape data from GooBix, which contains 156 games of \\(5\\times 5\\) mini crosswords. As we observe adjacent games contain similar clues, we use 20 games with indices \\(1,6,\\cdots,91,96\\) for testing, and games \\(136,141,146,151,156\\) for prompting. For each task, the input describes the 5 horizontal clues and 5 vertical clues, and the output should be a board of \\(5\\times 5=25\\) letters to solve the crosswords. For evaluation, we consider three levels of success: the portion of correct letters (25 per game), words (10 per game), and games.\n\n**Baselines.** We provide 5 example input-output pairs in the IO prompt, and in the CoT prompt additionally include intermediate words in the order h1..5 then v1..5. We run each prompt for 10 samples and average the results.\n\n**ToT Setup.** We leverage a depth-first search (Algorithm 2) that keeps exploring the most promising subsequent word clue until the state is no longer promising, then backtrack to the parent state to explore alternative thoughts. To make search tractable, subsequent thoughts are constrained not to change any filled words or letters, so that the ToT has at most 10 intermediate steps. For thought generation, at each state we translate all existing thoughts (e.g. \"h2.motor; h1.tasks\" for the state in Figure 6(a)) into letter constraints for remaining clues (e.g. \"v1.To heap: tm_,...\") and prompt a proposal prompt \\(5\\) times to come up with candidates for where and what to fill in the next word. Importantly, we also prompt the LM to give a confidence level for different thoughts, and aggregate\n\nFigure 4: A step of deliberate search in a randomly picked Creative Writing task. Given the input, the LM samples 5 different plans, then votes 5 times to decide which plan is best. The majority choice is used to consequently write the output passage with the same sample-vote procedure.\n\nFigure 5: Creative Writing results.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l|l l l} \\hline \\hline\n**Method** & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{**Success Rate (\\%)**} \\\\  & \\multicolumn{1}{l}{**Letter Word**} & \\multicolumn{1}{l}{**Game**} \\\\ \\hline IO & 38.7 & 14 & 0 \\\\ CoT & 40.6 & 15.6 & 1 \\\\ ToT (ours) & **78** & **60** & **20** \\\\ \\hline +best state & 82.4 & 67.5 & 35 \\\\ -prune & 65.4 & 41.5 & 5 \\\\ -backtrack & 54.6 & 20 & 5 \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 3: Mini Crosswords results.\n\nthese across proposals to obtain a sorted list of next thoughts to explore (Figure 6(a)). For state evaluations, we similarly translate each state into letter constraints for remaining clues, then evaluate for each clue if it is possible to fill given the constraints. If any remaining clue is deemed \"impossible\" to fill in (e.g. \"v1. To heap: tm_s_\"), then the exploration of the state's subtree is pruned and DFS backtracks to its parent to explore the next promising thought. We limit DFS search steps to 100, and simply render the deepest explored state (the first explored one if multiple) into the final output.\n\n**Results.** As shown in Table 3, IO and CoT prompting methods perform poorly with a word-level success rate less than \\(16\\%\\), while ToT significantly improves all metrics, achieving a word-level success rate of \\(60\\%\\) and solving 4 out of 20 games. Such an improvement is not surprising, given IO and CoT lack mechanisms to try different clues, make changes to decisions, or backtrack.\n\n**Oracle and ablation studies.** When outputting from the oracle best DFS state (instead of the heuristically determined best state) per task, ToT performance is even higher and actually solves 7/20 games (Table 3, \"+best state\"), indicating our simple output heuristics can be readily improved. Interestingly, sometimes when the crosswords game is actually solved, the state evaluator might still deem some words as \"impossible\" and prune -- possibly because \\(5\\times 5\\) crosswords by design have some rare or obsolete words that GPT-4 cannot recognize2. Given the state evaluation as a pruning heuristic is imperfect, we also explore ablating the pruning, and find the performance generally worse (Table 3, \"-prune\"). However, it could actually find the correct solution for 4/20 games (though only outputting 1 via heuristic), 3 of which are games ToT+pruning cannot solve within 100 steps. Thus, better heuristics for DFS pruning are critical for problem solving in this case. Lastly, we confirm the importance of backtracking by running an ablation that keeps filling the most promising clue for at most 20 steps, allowing overwrites. This is similar to a \"greedy\" BFS search with breadth limit of \\(b=1\\), and performs poorly with a word level success of only \\(20\\%\\) (Table 3, \"-backtrack\").\n\nFootnote 2: For example, \u201cagent\u201d is an obsolete form of \u201cagendum\u201d, but GPT-4 deems it a typo for \u201cagenda\u201d. External retrieval or web interaction could augment LM for problem solving under knowledge uncertainty.\n\n## 5 Related Work\n\n**Planning and decision making.** Smart planning and decision making are critical to achieving predefined goals. As they are trained on vast amount of world knowledge and human examples, LMs are known to have already absorbed rich commonsense that makes it possible to propose reasonable plans conditioned on problem setting and environmental states [10; 39; 34; 11; 32; 38; 37]. Our proposed Tree-of-Thought approach extends existing planning formulations by considering multiple potentially feasible plans simultaneously at each problem-solving step, and proceeding with the most promising ones. The integration between thought sampling and value feedback organically integrates planning and decision-making mechanisms, enabling effective search inside a solution tree. On the other hand, traditional decision-making procedures usually require training dedicated reward and policy models as in reinforcement learning (for example CHAI [30]), whereas we use the LM itself to provide the value estimates for decision making.\n\nFigure 6: In Mini Crosswords, (a) how thoughts are proposed and aggregated in a priority queue for depth-first search (DFS), and (b) how a state is evaluated based on the possibility of filling in each remaining word clue, and pruned if any remaining clue is deemed not possible to fill by the LM. Then DFS backtracks to the parent state and explore the next promising thought for clue.\n\n**Self-reflection.** Using LLMs to assess the viability of their own predictions is becoming an increasingly important procedure in problem solving. [25; 17; 21] introduced the \"self-reflection\" mechanism, in which LMs provide feedback to their generation candidates. [4] improves LMs code generation accuracy by injecting feedback messages generated by the LM itself based on its code execution results. Similarly, [14] also introduces \"critic\" or review steps over the actions and states, deciding the next action to take in solving computer operation tasks. Another recent work very relevant to ours is \"self-eval guided decoding\" [36]. Similar to our method, self-eval decoding also follows a tree-search procedure with leaves sampled from stochastic beam search decoding, which are then evaluated by LLM itself with carefully prepared self-eval prompts. Their approach however, uses the PAL formulation [7] which represents thoughts as codes, which makes it difficult to tackle challenging tasks like creative writing which we consider in this paper. Our Tree-of-Thought formulation is thus more versatile and handles challenging tasks on which GPT-4 only achieves very low accuracy with standard prompts.\n\n**Program-guided LLM generation.** Our proposal is also related to recent advancements that organize LM's behavior with symbolic program guidance. For example [24] embeds LMs in an algorithmic search procedure to help solve problems like question answering step-by-step, in which the search trees are expanded by relevant paragraphs that might provide answers. This approach however differs from ours in that trees are expanded by sampling external paragraphs instead of the LM's own thoughts, and there is no reflection or voting steps. Another approach, LLM+P [15], goes one step further and delegates the actual planning process to a classical planner.\n\n**Classical search methods.** Last but not least, our approach can be treated as a modern rendition of classical search methods for problem solving. For example it can be considered as a heuristic search algorithm like A* [8], in which the heuristic at each search node is provided by the LM's self-assessment. From this perspective, our method is also related to NeuroLogic A*esque decoding proposed in [16], which is inspired by A* search but introduces look-ahead heuristics that are efficient for LMs to improve the beam-search or top-k sampling decoding. This method however is constrained to sentence generation tasks, whereas our framework are designed for complex, multi-step problem solving guarded by value feedback.\n\n## 6 Discussion\n\n**Limitations and future directions.** Deliberate search such as ToT might not be necessary for many existing tasks that GPT-4 already excels at, and as an initial step this work only explores three relatively simple tasks that challenges GPT-4 and calls of better search and planning abilities incorporated with LMs. However, as we begin to deploy LMs for more real-world decision making applications (e.g. coding, data analysis, robotics, etc.), more complex tasks could emerge and present new opportunities to study these research questions. Also, search methods like ToT requires more resources (e.g. GPT-4 API cost) than sampling methods in order to improve task performances, but the modular flexibility of ToT allows users to customize such performance-cost tradeoffs, and ongoing open-source efforts [29] should readily reduce such costs in the near future. Lastly, this work focuses on using an off-the-shelf LM, and fine-tuning LMs using a ToT-style high-level counterfactual decision making (e.g. deliberating over potential choices for the next paragraph, instead of predicting the next token) might present opportunities to enhance the problem-solving capabilities of LMs.\n\n**Broader impact.** ToT is a framework that empowers LMs to more autonomously and intelligently make decisions and solve problems. While current tasks are limited to reasoning and search problems, future applications involving interaction with external environments or humans could bring potential danger, e.g. facilitating harmful uses of LMs. On the other hand, ToT also improves the interpretability of model decisions and the opportunity for human alignment, as the resulting representations are readable, high-level language reasoning instead of implicit, low-level token values.\n\n**Conclusion.** The associative \"System 1\" of LMs can be beneficially augmented by a \"System 2\" based on searching a tree of possible paths to the solution to a problem. The Tree of Thoughts framework provides a way to translate classical insights about problem-solving into actionable methods for contemporary LMs. At the same time, LMs address a weakness of these classical methods, providing a way to solve complex problems that are not easily formalized, such as creative writing. We see this intersection of LMs with classical approaches to AI as an exciting direction for future work.\n\n## References\n\n* [1] T. Brown, B. Mann, N. Ryder, M. Subbiah, J. D. Kaplan, P.

The ToT technique is inspired by the human\nmind\u2019s approach for solving complex reasoning tasks through trial and error. In\nthis process, the human mind explores the solution space through a tree-like\nthought process, allowing for backtracking when necessary. To implement ToT\nas a software system, we augment an LLM with additional modules including a\nprompter agent, a checker module, a memory module, and a ToT controller. In\norder to solve a given problem, these modules engage in a multi-round conversation with the LLM. The memory module records the conversation and state\nhistory of the problem solving process, which allows the system to backtrack\nto the previous steps of the thought-process and explore other directions from\nthere. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed technique, we implemented\na ToT-based solver for the Sudoku Puzzle. Experimental results show that the\nToT framework can significantly increase the success rate of Sudoku puzzle solving. Our implementation of the ToT-based Sudoku solver is available on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/jieyilong/tree-of-thought-puzzle-solver.\n1\nIntroduction\nSelf-attention based auto-regressive large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 have recently\ntaken the world by storm [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. These LLMs excel at a variety of tasks that previously\nthought as extremely difficult or even impossible. For example, they are able to handle various\nlogical and mathematical reasoning tasks, particularly those that entail \u201cshort-range reasonings\u201d\nnecessitating only a few steps to arrive at conclusions [6, 7]. Such remarkable capabilities have\neven led to speculation that an early form of artificial general intelligence (AGI) may have already\nemerged [7]. However, today\u2019s LLMs still exhibit limitations in certain domains, especially for\n\u201clong-range\u201d reasoning tasks, where long-term planning and solution exploration are necessary [7].\nWhen presenting a LLMs such as GPT-4 with a challenging problem solving task, especially the so\ncalled System-2 reasoning problems [8], the model does not always succeed. Although the generated\nanswer may be indicative of the correct direction, the derivation process frequently includes logical\nerrors. We hypothesize that there are two main contributing factors which limits the problem solving\nability of LLMs:\nLack of correctness checking: To ensure correctness, a good practice for a human solver is to\ncarry out verification procedures at every step of the problem-solving process, thereby ensuring the\ncredibility of the final solution. In comparison, auto-regressive language models do not explicitly\nperform logical correctness checks as it generates a new token based on the previous tokens. This\nlimits the model\u2019s capacity to rectify its own mistakes. A minor error could be amplified as the model\ngenerates more tokens, thereby leading to rapid solution quality deterioration and making it difficult\nto recover from mistakes.\nPreprint. Under review.\narXiv:2305.08291v1  [cs.AI]  15 May 2023\n\f(a) ToT search strategy.\n(b) ToT software system.\nFigure 1: (a) Details of the Tree-of-Thought search strategy, where a solid arrow means a search\nstep guided by the response from the LLM, and a dashed arrow indicates backtracking commanded\nby the ToT controller. (b) The software system implementing the Tree-of-Thought search strategy.\nIt enhances the problem solving capability of an LLM by augmenting it with additional modules\nincluding a prompter agent, a checker module, a memory module, and a ToT controller.\nSolution generated linearly: As mentioned above, LLMs typically generate a token based on the\npreceding sequence of tokens without backward editing. On the contrary, when a human solver\nattempts to solve a problem, she might backtrack to previous steps if a derivation step is incorrect,\nor if she becomes stuck and is unable to make further progress towards arriving at the final answer.\nFields Medal winner Terence Tao once shared his experiences solving hard math problems1: \u201cWhen I\nwas a kid, I had a romanticized notion of mathematics, that hard problems were solved in Eureka\nmoments of inspiration... With me, it\u2019s always, Let\u2019s try this. That gets me part of the way, or that\ndoesn\u2019t work. Now let\u2019s try this. Oh, there\u2019s a little shortcut here... You work on it long enough\nand you happen to make progress towards a hard problem by a back door at some point. At the\nend, it\u2019s usually, oh, I\u2019ve solved the problem.\u201d The problem solving process as he described is a\ntree-like thinking process, rather than a linear chain-of-thought [9]. The limitation of linear response\ngeneration is also apparent from a computational complexity perspective. The number of computation\nsteps an auto-regressive LLM can perform is polynomial in terms of its input length. Unless P =\nNP holds which contradicts the widely accepted belief, there would be problems in NP that is not\nsolvable by auto-regressive LLMs.\nInspired by these two shortcomings of auto-regressive LLMs, we propose a novel framework which\naugments an LLM with several additional modules including an automatic \u201cprompter agent\u201d. This\nframework employs a solution search strategy we call the Tree-of-Thought (ToT2). This strategy\nsolves a problem through a multi-round conversation between the LLM and the prompter agent.\nFigure 1a provides a visual description of the ToT search strategy, in which the LLM plays a crucial\nrole in guiding the search for solutions. To make it more concrete, let us assume the problem to be\nsolved is an instance of the Sudoku puzzle. The \u201croot\u201d node represents the initial state, corresponding\nto when a human mind just reads through the problem description, and begins the thinking process.\nA blue node in the figure represents a valid partial solution, which can be used by the LLM as a basis\nto generate the next search step. In the context of Sudoku puzzle solving, this means presenting a\npartially filled Sudoku board to an LLM and letting the LLM fill in a few more cells. The rationale\nis that an LLM like GPT-4 has been trained on a vast amount of text corpus which includes many\nSudoku puzzle solutions. Given a partially filled board, likely the LLM is able to recognize the\npattern, and provide useful insights on how to proceed following the Sudoku rules. Hence, it is highly\nprobable that a search guided by the LLM is significantly more efficient than a brute-force search. In\nthe figure, the search steps guided by the LLM are represented by the solid arrows. However, these\nsteps generated by the LLM are not guaranteed to be always logically correct. Thus, we introduce\n1https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/Terence-Tao-Mozart-of-Math-7252\n2The word \u201ctot\u201d means a very young child, which is an interesting analogy as this work is a preliminary\nexploration into the potential for automated problem-solving utilizing language models.\n2\n\fa \u201cchecker module\u201d to perform correctness checks. In Figure 1a, a gray node with an \u201cX\u201d marker\nrepresents a \u201cdead-end\u201d, i.e. a partial solution that the checker module considers as invalid. For\nSudoku, this means the partially filled board violates the Sudoku rules. If the current node is invalid,\nobviously we need to return to a parent or an ancestor node in order to correct the mistake. This\ncan be coordinated by a module called the \u201cToT controller\u201d which oversees the ToT search. With\nthe backtracking capability, the system can regenerate the solution and thus recover from errors. In\naddition, even when the current node is valid, if the system remains stuck at it for too long, the ToT\ncontroller could issue a backtrack signal to explore other possible solutions. This is similar to a\nscenario where a human mind realizes that there is no viable path towards reaching the final solution\nthrough a particular direction, prompting her to change course and explore alternative routes. This\nprocess continues until either a full solution is found (represented by a green node in the figure), or a\npre-specified maximum round of conversations is reached.\nNote that while the above discussion utilized Sudoku solving as a tangible example to illustrate\nour main ideas, the ToT framework can potentially be applied to more general mathematical and\nlogical reasoning tasks. For example, in the context of mathematical theorem proving, a full solution\ncorresponds to the complete proof, encompassing a total of n derivation steps. On the other hand, a\npartial solution refers to a subset of these steps, specifically the initial k steps, where k is less than n.\nThe checker verifies the logically correctness of a given partial proof. In parallel, the prompter agent\nand the ToT controller can offer hints and suggestions to the LLM, encouraging it to think about the\nsubsequent proving step, or explore different directions for theorem proving when necessary.\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of the ToT framework, we implemented a ToT-based Sudoku puzzle\nsolver and evaluate it on a suite of Sudoku puzzle benchmarks we created. As shown by the\nexperimental results in Section 4.2, the ToT framework can significantly increase the success rate of\nSudoku puzzle solving.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature and\ncompared our approach with the most relevant works. Section 3 provides the details of the ToT\nsystem architecture. Section 4 describes our implementation of a ToT-based Sudoku puzzle solver\nand presents the experimental results. Finally, Section 5 discusses the limitation of the present work,\nand potential future extensions of the ToT framework.\n2\nRelated Works\nDeveloping intelligent systems that can reason has long been one of the primary goals of artificial\nintelligence [10, 11, 12]. Recent advancements in large language models, particularly the discovery of\ntheir emergent properties and in-context learning abilities, have opened up a new avenue for machine\nreasoning [6, 7, 9]. It is discovered that prompting language models using chain-of-thought and\nother hints can elicit them to output step-by-step solutions for mathematical and logical reasoning\ntasks [9, 13]. Building on these findings, recent studies have also explored the practice of sampling\nmultiple solutions and using self-consistency or complexity-based criteria to determine the optimal\nresponse [14, 15]. Experiments were also conducted to evaluate the performance of different prompts\n[15]. The self-taught reasoner (STaR) [16] is a technique which asks an LLM to generate reasoning\nchains and drop those producing incorrect answers. Then, the model is fine-tuned with the remaining\nvalid reasoning chains.\nDespite showing high potential, these techniques often necessitate human involvement. For example,\nchain-of-thought style prompting techniques require carefully hand-crafted examples and is thus\ndifficult to scale. Consequently, researchers have started to explore the possibility of automatic\nprompt generation. Early exploration in this domain includes AutoPrompt [17], prefix-tuning [18],\nand parameter-efficient prompt tuning [19]. This research direction received even more attention\nlately. In a recent study [20], the authors experimented with training verifiers to check if the solution\nprovided by an LLM to an given mathematical problem is logically correct. If the trained verifier can\neffectively judge the LLM outputs, it would provide another avenue for prompt evaluation. Automatic\nprompt engineer [21] examines a method to select the best prompt from a set of model-generated\ncandidates. The three-phase augment-prune-select method was suggested in [22]. It first generates\nmultiple chain-of-thought candidates, which was then pruned based on whether the derived answer\nmatches with the ground truths. Finally, a policy gradient based method was used to select the optimal\ncombination of several rationale chains from the pool for CoT prompting.\n3\n\fVery recently researchers have also turned their attention to augmenting LLM with additional agents\nfor various purposes. This is also the research field that is most relevant to our current work. AutoGPT\n[23] is a program which combines GPT-4 with additional modules including an execution agent and a\nmemory unit. It can chain together LLM \u201cthoughts\u201d, in order to autonomously achieve whatever goal\nthe user sets. PromptPG [24] proposes an approach that can learn to select in-context examples from\na small amount of training data via policy gradient for prompt learning. The PromptPG agent learns\nto find optimal in-context examples from a candidate pool, with the goal of maximizing the prediction\nrewards on given training examples when interacting with the GPT-3 environment. DEPS [25] is\na proposal that utilizes multi-step reasoning and sub-task error correction to tackle complex tasks\nwith long-range dependencies. By being able to provide explanations for errors in sub-tasks within\na trial, DEPS exhibits remarkable performance. ReAct [26] is an approach that employs emergent\nproperties present in LLMs, such as traces of verbal reasoning, to enable agents to reason and take\naction, resulting in impressive performance on different text-based benchmarks. Building on top of\nReAct, Reflexion [27] is an approach that equips an agent with dynamic memory and self-reflection\ncapabilities, improving its existing reasoning trace and ability to choose task-specific actions. To\nachieve complete automation, a simple but effective heuristic was designed to enable the agent to\nidentify hallucination instances and prevent repetitive action sequences. Our proposal shares some\ncommonalities with these approaches, for example, the use of a memory module and additional\nagents for automatic prompt generation. However, our approach is unique in that it introduces a\nToT controller which can explicitly conduct backtracking when necessary. This not only allows the\nsystem to recover from mistakes, but potentially can also enlarge the solution search space.\n3\nArchitecture\n3.1\nThe Tree-of-Thought Framework\nFigure 1b depicts the software system that implements the ToT Framework. As mentioned earlier, it\nincorporates several components which enhance the problem solving capability of the LLM, including\na prompter agent, a checker module, a memory module, and a ToT controller.\nThe problem solving process starts with the user inputting the problem description. The prompter\nagent then relays the problem to the LLM, with additional prompt text which encourages the LLM\nto come up with an intermediate solution instead of trying to reach the full solution in a single shot.\nAfter receiving the response from the LLM, the checker module is invoked to check the validity of\nthe intermediate solution generated. If it passes the correctness check, the intermediate solution will\nbe parsed and stored in the memory module. Then, based on the content of the memory module, the\nprompter agent generates a prompt to encourage the LLM to generate the next step. Conversely, if\nthe LLM generates an invalid intermediate solution, the ToT controller will activate the prompter to\noffer hints to the LLM and request it to consider again. Note that in general, a valid intermediate\nsolution does not always leads to the correct final solution. In order to prevent getting stuck, the ToT\ncontroller constantly monitors the search process and determines whether to continue trying from the\ncurrent node or backtrack to a parent or an ancestor node and explore alternative directions.\nThe ToT strategy can be viewed as a tree-search algorithm using an LLM as a heuristic for generating\nthe search steps. In this setting, the LLM is only used for the \u201cshort-range reasoning\u201d tasks, i.e\nderiving the next intermediate solution, which is a type of tasks that have been shown to have a high\nsuccess rate for LLMs [7]. On the other hand, by introducing the checker, the system have a higher\nlikelihood to discover the mistakes it makes as it generates the solutions. Moreover, by allowing the\nsystem to backtrack from a valid but somewhat \u201chopeless\u201d intermediate solution, the system is able to\nexplore a larger solution space, which enhances the \u201clong-range reasoning\u201d capability of the system\nas a whole. The ToT framework thus combines the best of both world. Furthermore, this multi-round\nconversation technique increases the number of computation steps the system can perform. Thus,\nbased on the time hierarchy theorem in computational complexity theory [28], the ToT framework\ncan expand the range of problems that can potentially be solved compared to relying solely on a\nsingle round of conversation with an LLM.\n3.2\nToT Modules\nIn this section we provide more details of the components of the ToT software system.\n4\n\fChecker Module. The checker module can either be rule-based or implemented as a deep neural\nnetwork. For problems that have an explicit polynomial time algorithm for correctness checking (i.e.\nproblems in NP), rule-based checkers can be implemented. Numerous important mathematical and\nlogical problems are in this category, for example, equation solving, polynomial factoring, 3SAT, and\npuzzles like Sudoku. With a rule-based checker, the ToT software can be viewed as a hybrid system\nwhich allows explicitly encoding prior knowledge (e.g. the Sudoku rules) into a neural network\npowered system. An alternative is to train and use a neural network based classifier as the checker\n[20]. This is especially useful for problems where a rule-based checker is difficult to implement, e.g.\nchecking whether a mathematical proof is correct.\nMemory Module. The memory module can be used to store the entire conversation history between\nthe LLM and the prompter agent, as well as other supplemental data useful for problem solving. The\ndata stored can be served as the information source for the prompter agent to generate helpful hints\nfor the LLM.\nToT Controller. The ToT controller oversees the entire ToT search. It can be implemented in a\nnumber of ways. It can be as simple as encoding two rules: 1) if the checker thinks the current partial\nsolution is invalid, backtrack to the parent node, and 2) if the current partial solution is valid, but the\nToT search tree has explored its C children and yet failed to find the final solution, then backtrack to\nthe parent node. Here C is an pre-configured integer.\nA more advanced version of the ToT controller can employ a policy network to determine the\nbacktracking policy. The network\u2019s inputs include the recent search history comprised of the sequence\nof the last k +1 node visited in the search tree si\u2212k, .., si\u22121, si (k is a hyper-parameter). The network\nalso takes in ci, a Boolean variable which indicates whether the checker module considers the current\nnode si is valid. We can sample from the policy to determine the next action ai:\nai \u223c \u03c0t\n\u03c1(a|ci, si, .., si\u2212k), a \u2208 Acand\n(1)\nwhere \u03c0t\n\u03c1 represents the policy network of the ToT controller with parameters \u03c1. The set of candidate\nactions Acand includes simply staying at the current node to generate the next step, and backtracking\nto the parent or an ancestor node at most L levels up in the search tree where L is a hyper-parameter.\nThus, we can use one-hot encoding for the actions, where backtracking j levels up is represented by a\nvector where only the jth position is set to 1. The action vector a and checker output ci are processed\nby a feed-forward network (FFN) to for deep features extraction. A linear layer with learnable\nparameters W1 and b1 is added on top of the FFN to map its output to a vector g(a, ci). The latest\nk + 1 visited nodes are concatenated into a string, and then added with position embedding (PE),\nand finally inputted into a self-attention model [1]. The idea is that by adding position embedding,\nthe attention model will be able to make decisions based on the sequence of the recent node visits.\nA linear layer with learnable parameters W2 and b2 is added on top of the attention model to\ntransform its output to a vector g(si, .., si\u2212k) whose dimension matches with that of g(a, ci). Finally,\nwe calculate the inner-products of these two vectors, and use the softmax function to compute the\nprobability of each action candidate:\ng(a, ci) = W1 \u00b7 FFN(a, ci) + b1\ng(si, .., si\u2212k) = W2 \u00b7 Attention(PE(si\u2212k||..||si\u22121||si)) + b2\n\u03c0t\n\u03c1(a|ci, si, .., si\u2212k) =\nexp(g(a, ci) \u00b7 g(si, .., si\u2212k))\n\ufffd\na\u2032\u2208Acand exp(g(a\u2032, ci) \u00b7 g(si, .., si\u2212k))\n(2)\nIn the above formula, \u201c||\u201d is the string concatenation operator. Section 3.3 will discuss the training\nalgorithm for the ToT controller policy network.\nPrompter Agent. The prompter agent gives hints to the LLM for it to generate the next search step.\nThe most basic hint can be a generic prompt using the following template: generic_tmpl = \u201cFor the\ngiven problem: [problem description], we have come up with a partial solution: [partial solution\nsummary]. Please derive the next step on top of this partial solution, and return the next step in\nthe following JSON format {next_step: <next_step>}\u201d. Note that the template requires the LLM to\nrespond with a structured JSON string. This is a trick to make it easier for the checker to extract the\nnext step from the LLM response. To create an actual prompt from this template, the prompter needs\nthe [problem description] and the [partial solution summary], both of which can be queried from the\nmemory module.\n5\n\fAlgorithm 1 Policy Gradient based Training Algorithm for the ToT System\n1: Input: training set Ptrain, num of training epochs N\n2: procedure REINFORCE(Ptrain, N)\n3:\nrandomly initialized the ToT Controller policy \u03c0t\n\u03c1\n4:\nrandomly initialized the Prompter agent policy \u03c0p\n\u03b8\n5:\nfor epoch = 1, 2, .., N do\n6:\n\u03c0w \u2190 \u03c0t\n\u03c1 if epoch is even, \u03c0p\n\u03b8 otherwise \u25b7 update the selected policy only, fix the other\n7:\nfor pi \u2208 Ptrain do\n8:\nri \u2190 reward(ToTSystem(pi)) \u25b7 attempt to solve problem pi and obtain reward ri\n9:\nw \u2190 w + \u03b1\u2207wlog\u03c0wri\n10:\nend for\n11:\nend for\n12: end procedure\nSimilar to the ToT controller, we can also implement the prompter agent as a policy network, which\ncan generate prompts based on the current partial solution and the conversation history. First we\ndefine the prompt template as follows: prompt_tmpl = generic_tmpl || \u201cHere are a few examples:\n[in-context learning examples].\u201d, where || is the string concatenation operator. The variable [in\ncontext learning examples] are in-context learning examples for the problem being solved, which can\nbe picked by the prompter policy network from a set of candidates, similar to the PromptPG approach\n[24]. The rationale is that given the current and recently attempted intermediate solution, some\nin-context examples might work better than others as hints for the next step. Given the recently visited\nnode sequence si\u2212k, .., si\u22121, si, our goal is to select l examples ei = {e1\ni , e2\ni , ..., el\ni|ej\ni \u2208 Ecand}\nwhere Ecand is a pool of in-context learning example candidates. The examples are selected according\non a policy:\nej\ni \u223c \u03c0p\n\u03b8(e|si, .., si\u2212k), ej\ni \u2208 Ecand for j = 1, 2, ..., l\n(3)\nwhere \u03c0p\n\u03b8 represents the policy network of the prompter agent with parameters \u03b8.\nWith the\nset of selected examples, the prompter agent generates a prompt from the template: pi =\nprompter(prompt_tmpl, ei, si), which can be fed into the LLM to obtain the next intermediate\nsolution si+1 = LLM(pi). The neural network architecture for the prompter\u2019s policy network is\nsimilar to that of the ToT controller. The only difference is that since the in-context examples are\nexpressed in natural language, instead of FFN, we use an attention model to process them:\nh(e) = M1 \u00b7 Attention(e) + c1\nh(si, .., si\u2212k) = M2 \u00b7 Attention(PE(si\u2212k||..||si\u22121||si)) + c2\n\u03c0p\n\u03b8(e|si, .., si\u2212k) =\nexp(h(e) \u00b7 h(si, .., si\u2212k))\n\ufffd\ne\u2032\u2208Ecand exp(h(e\u2032) \u00b7 h(si, .., si\u2212k))\n(4)\nThe prompter policy network can be trained together with the ToT controller using multi-agent\nreinforcement learning methods. The training algorithm of the prompter\u2019s policy network is discussed\nin Section 3.3.\n3.3\nToT System Training\nIn the previous sections, we have described the multi-agent ToT framework. This section dives into\nhow we can train the agents, in particular, the policy networks of the ToT controller and the prompter\nagent. While there are many multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms (MARL) proposed in\nthe literature [29, 30, 31], in this work we adopt a relatively simple approach which uses a modified\nversion of the REINFORCE algorithm [32] to train the policy networks of the ToT controller and the\nprompter agent directly. The more advanced MARL algorithms will be explored in the future.\nFirst, we define a run of the ToT system as the process where a user inputs the problem description,\nand the ToT system attempts to solve the problem until it thinks the problem is solved, or a prespecified maximum round of conversations is reached. Next, we define the reward r of a run: if the\nproblem is correctly solved, then r = +1. Otherwise, if the system outputs an incorrect solution, or\nthe maximum round of conversations is reached, then r = \u22121.\n6\n\fAlgorithm 2 Problem Solving Using the ToT System\n1: Input: problem description from the user puser, max num of conversation rounds K\n2: procedure SOLVE(puser, K)\n3:\nprompt \u2190 Prompter(puser)\n4:\nfor round = 1, 2, .., K do\n5:\nresponse \u2190 LLM(prompt)\n6:\nresult \u2190 Checker(response)\n7:\nif result.isValidFinalSolution() then\n8:\nreturn (result.solution)\n9:\nend if\n10:\nmemory.store(result)\n11:\nctrl_signal \u2190 ToTController(memory)\n12:\nprompt \u2190 Prompter(memory, ctrl_signal)\n13:\nend for\n14:\nreturn (nil)\n15: end procedure\nThe training algorithm is provided in Algorithm 1. The algorithm takes two inputs, the training data set\nPtrain, and the number of training epochs N (Line 1-2). The two policy networks \u03c0t\n\u03c1(ai|si, .., si\u2212k)\nand \u03c0p\n\u03b8(ei|si, .., si\u2212k) are randomly initialized (Line 3-4). We train the two policy networks in turns,\ni.e. training one network with policy gradient while keeping the other fixed (Line 6). To be more\nspecific, when the current epoch is an even number, we select the ToT controller policy \u03c0t\n\u03c1, and keep\nthe parameters of the prompter agent fixed. Otherwise, we select the prompter agent policy \u03c0p\n\u03b8 and fix\nthe ToT controller policy. Next, the algorithm updates the parameters of the selected policy network\nusing the policy gradient method (Line 7-9). For each problem in the training data, we attempt to\nsolve it with a ToT system run. Based on the result, we obtain the reward for that run (Line 8). The\nentire training algorithm runs for N epochs.\n3.4\nProblem Solving Using the ToT System\nAfter the ToT system is trained, we can use it for inference, i.e. problem solving. Algorithm 2\nprovides the pseudo code for solving problems using the ToT system. It starts with a user inputting\ndescription of the problem (Line 1-2). The prompter module then converts the user input into a\nprompt (Line 3) using a prompt template for user input, for example: user_input_prompt = \u201cFor\nthe given problem: [problem description], please derive the first step, and return the step in the\nfollowing JSON format {next_step: <next_step>}\u201d.\nNext, up to K rounds of conversations with the LLM are conducted for problem solving (Line 4).\nIn each round, the LLM first produces a response for the given prompt (Line 5). Then, the checker\nanalyzes the response, and returns a result (Line 6). The result contains the partial solution extracted\nfrom the LLM response, as well as information like whether the checker considers the solution as a\nvalid final solution, a valid intermediate solution, or an invalid partial solution, etc. If the solution\nis a valid final solution, the algorithm simply returns it (Line 7-9). Otherwise, the result is stored\nin the memory module (Line 10). Based on the content of the memory module, the ToT controller\nissues control signals, e.g. backtracking for l levels, to the prompter (Line 11). Finally, based on\nthe control signal, the prompter looks up the relevant information from the memory module, and\nproduce the next prompt for the LLM (Line 12). If no valid final solution is found within K rounds\nof conversations, the algorithm return nil indicating it fails to solve the problem (Line 14).\n4\nEvaluation\nThis section provides the evaluation methodology and experimental results for our proposed ToT\nframework. Our evaluation focuses on the ToT-based solver for the Sudoku problem. At the first\nglance, Sudoku problems seem to be just brain teasers with little practical importance. However,\nthe generalized Sudoku problem on n2 \u00d7 n2 grids of n \u00d7 n blocks is known to be NP-complete\n[33]. If the ToT framework can solve instances of the generalized Sudoku problem (granted that\nit might takes an exponential number of rounds of conversations), in principle it can handle many\n7\n\f3x3 puzzles\n4x4 puzzles\n5x5 puzzles\n0\n0.5\n1\n0.4\n0.2\n0.1\n0.9\n0.4\n0.5\n0.9\n0.5\n0.5\n1\n0.9\n0.8\nSuccess rate\nzs\nos\nfs\ntot\nFigure 2: Experimental results comparing the success rate of different LLM-based Sudoku puzzle\nsolvers across three sets of benchmarks.\nother mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. In fact, it is straightforward to re-purpose the\nimplementation described below to solve other puzzles, such as 3SAT, 3-coloring, etc. Below we\nfirst describe the implementation details of the solver. Then, we present the test suite used in our\nevaluation, as well as the experimental results.\n4.1\nToT Solver for Sudoku Puzzles\nThe ToT-based Sudoku solver follows the generic framework described in Section 3 with some\nspecific tweaks for the Sudoku problem. It allows a user to input a Sudoku puzzle using natural\nlanguages, for example: \u201cPlease solve this 4x4 Sudoku puzzle [[3,*,*,2],[1,*,3,*],[*,1,*,3],[4,*,*,1]]\nwhere * represents a cell to be filled\u201d.\nWe have implemented the ToT-based Sudoku solver as described in Section 4.1 in Python. We\nadopted a rule-based approach for the checker module since the Sudoku rules are precise and easy\nto check. The memory module stores the conversation history between the prompter and the LLM,\nas well as a search tree which maintains all the partially filled Sudoku board the LLM has generated\nso far. This way, when backtracking happens, the previous board configuration can be retrieved.\nThe ToT controller in our implementation is also rule-based. It returns to the parent node in the\nsearch tree if either the current node considered invalid by the checker, or the search algorithm has\nexplored more than 5 children of the current node. Finally the prompter agent uses a variation of\nthe generic template mentioned above, with the [problem description] being the initial configuration\nof the Sudoku board input by the user, and [partial solution summary] being the partially filled\nboard represented by the current node in the search tree. The LLM utilized in this study is the\n\"gpt-3.5-turbo\" model, which is accessible through the OpenAI API suite. The temperature parameter\nwas set to 1 in our experiments.\n4.2\nExperimental Results\nWe have implemented four LLM-based Sudoku puzzle solvers and compared their performance: 1)\nzero-shot solver (zs) which directly posts the puzzle description to the LLM, 2) one-shot solver (os)\nwhich provides a chain-of-thought style step-by-step solution of a 3x3 Sudoku puzzle as an example\nin addition to the problem description, 3) few-shot solver (fs) which provides multiple examples\nwith CoT-style solutions, and 4) our proposed Tree-of-Thought solver (tot). We constructed three\nbenchmarks, comprising of ten 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5 Sudoku puzzles, respectively. The objective of\na solver is to fill the n \u00d7 n Sudoku grid with digits so that each row and column contain all of the\ndigits from 1 to n (n = 3, 4, 5 in our experiments).\nFigure 2 compares the success rates of different LLM-based solvers across the three benchmarks.\nHere the term success rate refers to the fraction of problems in a benchmark set that are successfully\nsolved by a solver. For example, if a solver is able to solve 4 out of 10 problems in the \u201c3x3 puzzles\u201d\nbenchmark set, then the success rate of this solver for this benchmark set is 0.4. As expected, the\nzero-shot solver has the worst performance across all the three set of benchmarks. Adding CoT-style\nstep-by-step examples significantly boosts the success rate, especially for the 3x3 puzzles. This is\nexpected, since one can pretty much rely on \u201cshort-range\u201d reasoning skills, which is a strength of the\n8\n\fLLM models, to solve a small-sized 3x3 Sudoku puzzle, espcially when CoT-style hints are provided.\nHowever, as the puzzle size gets bigger, the success rate of the one-shot and few-shot solver dropped\nto around 0.5. This is because solving bigger puzzles requires trial and error, which is a capability\nLLMs generally lack of as discussed earlier.\nIn comparison, the ToT-based solver demonstrates superior performance when compared to the other\nsolvers. For the 3x3 benchmark set, it was able to solve all the puzzles. The success rate improves\nby 11% compared to the second best for the two benchmark sets. For the 4x4 benchmark set, the\nToT-based solver failed to find the solution for 1 out of the 10 puzzles before reaching the maximum\nround of conversations (which is set to 100 in our experiments). We suspect it is due to the limited\ncapability of the rule-based ToT controller. In particular, the rule-based controller has no sense of\nwhether the current partially-filled board can be completed without violating the Sudoku rules, which\ndecreases the efficiency of the solution search. We expect a neural network based ToT controller will\nperform better, which we will verify in the future extension of this work. Despite this, the success\nrate of the ToT based solver is still 80% higher compared to that of the one-shot and few-shot based\nsolvers. Finally, for the 5x5 puzzles, the ToT-based solver failed with 2 puzzles before reaching the\nmaximum round of conversations. Nonetheless, the success rate is 60% higher compared to that of\nthe one-shot and few-shot based solvers.\n5\nDiscussions and Future Works\nIn this paper, we presented the Tree-of-Thought framework, which enhances LLMs with additional\nagents and memory modules, resulting in improved performance for mathematical problem-solving\ntasks. To evaluate the performance of this technique, we implemented a Sudoku puzzle solver based\non the ToT framework. One of the limitations of the current implementation is that it utilizes a\nrule-based checker that contains custom logic, making it less easily adaptable to other problems. For\nmore generic problems, for example, general mathematical and logical reasoning problems, where\nrule-based solution checking is difficult to implement, a future direction is to explore checkers based\non neural network or other probabilistic models. Moreover, the experiments we conducted in this\nwork also uses a rule-based ToT controller, which as we pointed out, has limited capabilities. In the\nfuture, we will implement the neural network based ToT controller which can hopefully enhance the\nsystem performance. Additionally, the policy-gradient based training algorithm proposed in this work\nis relatively simple and may be susceptible to training stability issues. To further optimize the ToT\nsystem, more advanced multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly those designed\nfor cooperative agents, could be adopted.\nAnother intriguing future direction is to investigate the potential of utilizing the \u201cself-play\u201d technique\nto enable the ToT system to develop novel problem solving strategies that are not found in the LLM\u2019s\ntraining text corpus. The self-play training method is a reinforcement learning technique which was\npopularized by the development of competitive game-playing agents such as AlphaGo and AlphaStar\n[34, 35, 36], where an AI agent learns to improve its own strategy by playing against itself. Today\u2019s\nLLMs are typically trained using self-supervised learning techniques. They may have limitations\nwhen it comes to problem-solving, as they may not be able to generate samples (i.e. novel problem\nsolving strategies) that fall outside the distribution of the training data. In other words, they may not\nbe able to \u201cthink outside the box\u201d, which is a crucial human trait that facilitates the discovery of new\nknowledge. Compared to self-supervised learning, self-play based reinforcement learning enables the\nsystem to access a much broader solution space beyond the provided training examples, allowing for\ngreater improvement. AlphaGo and similar systems have demonstrated the ability to devise strategies\nthat surpass even those of human experts. Inspired by these examples, for ToT system training,\ninstead of relying on the training data set Ptrain, we can introduce a \u201cquizzer\u201d module which can\ncome up with problem descriptions on its own to train the ToT controller and the prompter agent. It\nis worth mentioning that one of the key enablers for training AlphaGo and similar system is that the\nenvironment reward can be precisely determined, as it is straightforward to determine whether the\ngameplay results in a win or a loss. The ToT framework incorporates a checker that can assess the\ncorrectness of the solution, functioning similarly to the environment, particularly for problems that\nhave well-defined solution validation rules. Thus, the reinforcement learning training methods can be\nreadily applied. We suspect that this self-driven learning approach, similar to the self-play method,\ncould be an effective means of improving the ToT framework\u2019s problem-solving capabilities beyond\nthe solution examples provided in the training text corpus for the LLMs.\n9\n\fReferences\n[1] Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan N.

The ToT technique is inspired by the human mind's approach for solving complex reasoning tasks through trial and error. In this process, the human mind explores the solution space through a tree-like thought process, allowing for backtracking when necessary. To implement ToT as a software system, we augment an LLM with additional modules including a prompter agent, a checker module, a memory module, and a ToT controller. In order to solve a given problem, these modules engage in a multi-round conversation with the LLM. The memory module records the conversation and state history of the problem solving process, which allows the system to backtrack to the previous steps of the thought-process and explore other directions from there. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed technique, we implemented a ToT-based solver for the Sudoku Puzzle. Experimental results show that the ToT framework can significantly increase the success rate of Sudoku puzzle solving. Our implementation of the ToT-based Sudoku solver is available on GitHub: [https://github.com/jieyilong/tree-of-thought-puzzle-solver](https://github.com/jieyilong/tree-of-thought-puzzle-solver).\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nSelf-attention based auto-regressive large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 have recently taken the world by storm [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6]. These LLMs excel at a variety of tasks that previously thought as extremely difficult or even impossible. For example, they are able to handle various logical and mathematical reasoning tasks, particularly those that entail \"short-range reasonings\" necessitating only a few steps to arrive at conclusions [6; 7]. Such remarkable capabilities have even led to speculation that an early form of artificial general intelligence (AGI) may have already emerged [7]. However, today's LLMs still exhibit limitations in certain domains, especially for \"long-range\" reasoning tasks, where long-term planning and solution exploration are necessary [7]. When presenting a LLMs such as GPT-4 with a challenging problem solving task, especially the so called System-2 reasoning problems [8], the model does not always succeed. Although the generated answer may be indicative of the correct direction, the derivation process frequently includes logical errors. We hypothesize that there are two main contributing factors which limits the problem solving ability of LLMs:\n\n**Lack of correctness checking**: To ensure correctness, a good practice for a human solver is to carry out verification procedures at _every step_ of the problem-solving process, thereby ensuring the credibility of the final solution. In comparison, auto-regressive language models do not explicitly perform logical correctness checks as it generates a new token based on the previous tokens. This limits the model's capacity to rectify its own mistakes. A minor error could be amplified as the model generates more tokens, thereby leading to rapid solution quality deterioration and making it difficult to recover from mistakes.\n\n**Solution generated linearly**: As mentioned above, LLMs typically generate a token based on the preceding sequence of tokens without backward editing. On the contrary, when a human solver attempts to solve a problem, she might backtrack to previous steps if a derivation step is incorrect, or if she becomes stuck and is unable to make further progress towards arriving at the final answer. Fields Medal winner Terence Tao once shared his experiences solving hard math problems1: \"When I was a kid, I had a romanticized notion of mathematics, that hard problems were solved in Eureka moments of inspiration... With me, it's always, Let's try this. That gets me part of the way, or that doesn't work. Now let's try this. Oh, there's a little shortcut here... You work on it long enough and you happen to make progress towards a hard problem by a back door at some point. At the end, it's usually, oh, I've solved the problem.\" The problem solving process as he described is a _tree-like_ thinking process, rather than a _linear_ chain-of-thought [9]. The limitation of linear response generation is also apparent from a computational complexity perspective. The number of computation steps an auto-regressive LLM can perform is polynomial in terms of its input length. Unless **P** = **NP** holds which contradicts the widely accepted belief, there would be problems in **NP** that is not solvable by auto-regressive LLMs.\n\nFootnote 1: [https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/Terence-Tao-Mozart-of-Math-7252](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/Terence-Tao-Mozart-of-Math-7252)\n\nInspired by these two shortcomings of auto-regressive LLMs, we propose a novel framework which augments an LLM with several additional modules including an automatic \"prompter agent\". This framework employs a solution search strategy we call the _Tree-of-Thought (ToT2_). This strategy solves a problem through a multi-round conversation between the LLM and the prompter agent. Figure 0(a) provides a visual description of the ToT search strategy, in which the LLM plays a crucial role in _guiding_ the search for solutions. To make it more concrete, let us assume the problem to be solved is an instance of the Sudoku puzzle. The \"root\" node represents the initial state, corresponding to when a human mind just reads through the problem description, and begins the thinking process. A blue node in the figure represents a valid partial solution, which can be used by the LLM as a basis to generate the next search step. In the context of Sudoku puzzle solving, this means presenting a partially filled Sudoku board to an LLM and letting the LLM fill in a few more cells. The rationale is that an LLM like GPT-4 has been trained on a vast amount of text corpus which includes many Sudoku puzzle solutions. Given a partially filled board, likely the LLM is able to recognize the pattern, and provide useful insights on how to proceed following the Sudoku rules. Hence, it is highly probable that a search guided by the LLM is significantly more efficient than a brute-force search. In the figure, the search steps guided by the LLM are represented by the solid arrows. However, these steps generated by the LLM are not guaranteed to be always logically correct. Thus, we introduce\n\nFigure 1: (a) Details of the Tree-of-Thought search strategy, where a solid arrow means a search step guided by the response from the LLM, and a dashed arrow indicates backtracking commanded by the ToT controller. (b) The software system implementing the Tree-of-Thought search strategy. It enhances the problem solving capability of an LLM by augmenting it with additional modules including a prompter agent, a checker module, a memory module, and a ToT controller.\n\na \"checker module\" to perform correctness checks. In Figure 0(a), a gray node with an \"X\" marker represents a \"dead-end\", i.e. a partial solution that the checker module considers as invalid. For Sudoku, this means the partially filled board violates the Sudoku rules. If the current node is invalid, obviously we need to return to a parent or an ancestor node in order to correct the mistake. This can be coordinated by a module called the \"ToT controller\" which oversees the ToT search. With the backtracking capability, the system can regenerate the solution and thus recover from errors. In addition, even when the current node is valid, if the system remains stuck at it for too long, the ToT controller could issue a backtrack signal to explore other possible solutions. This is similar to a scenario where a human mind realizes that there is no viable path towards reaching the final solution through a particular direction, prompting her to change course and explore alternative routes. This process continues until either a full solution is found (represented by a green node in the figure), or a pre-specified maximum round of conversations is reached.\n\nNote that while the above discussion utilized Sudoku solving as a tangible example to illustrate our main ideas, the ToT framework can potentially be applied to more general mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. For example, in the context of mathematical theorem proving, a full solution corresponds to the complete proof, encompassing a total of \\(n\\) derivation steps. On the other hand, a partial solution refers to a subset of these steps, specifically the initial \\(k\\) steps, where \\(k\\) is less than \\(n\\). The checker verifies the logically correctness of a given partial proof. In parallel, the prompter agent and the ToT controller can offer hints and suggestions to the LLM, encouraging it to think about the subsequent proving step, or explore different directions for theorem proving when necessary.\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of the ToT framework, we implemented a ToT-based Sudoku puzzle solver and evaluate it on a suite of Sudoku puzzle benchmarks we created. As shown by the experimental results in Section 4.2, the ToT framework can significantly increase the success rate of Sudoku puzzle solving.\n\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature and compared our approach with the most relevant works. Section 3 provides the details of the ToT system architecture. Section 4 describes our implementation of a ToT-based Sudoku puzzle solver and presents the experimental results. Finally, Section 5 discusses the limitation of the present work, and potential future extensions of the ToT framework.\n\n## 2 Related Works\n\nDeveloping intelligent systems that can reason has long been one of the primary goals of artificial intelligence [10; 11; 12]. Recent advancements in large language models, particularly the discovery of their emergent properties and in-context learning abilities, have opened up a new avenue for machine reasoning [6; 7; 9]. It is discovered that prompting language models using chain-of-thought and other hints can elicit them to output step-by-step solutions for mathematical and logical reasoning tasks [9; 13]. Building on these findings, recent studies have also explored the practice of sampling multiple solutions and using self-consistency or complexity-based criteria to determine the optimal response [14; 15]. Experiments were also conducted to evaluate the performance of different prompts [15]. The self-taught reasoner (STaR) [16] is a technique which asks an LLM to generate reasoning chains and drop those producing incorrect answers. Then, the model is fine-tuned with the remaining valid reasoning chains.\n\nDespite showing high potential, these techniques often necessitate human involvement. For example, chain-of-thought style prompting techniques require carefully hand-crafted examples and is thus difficult to scale. Consequently, researchers have started to explore the possibility of automatic prompt generation. Early exploration in this domain includes AutoPrompt [17], prefix-tuning [18], and parameter-efficient prompt tuning [19]. This research direction received even more attention lately. In a recent study [20], the authors experimented with training verifiers to check if the solution provided by an LLM to an given mathematical problem is logically correct. If the trained verifier can effectively judge the LLM outputs, it would provide another avenue for prompt evaluation. Automatic prompt engineer [21] examines a method to select the best prompt from a set of model-generated candidates. The three-phase augment-prune-select method was suggested in [22]. It first generates multiple chain-of-thought candidates, which was then pruned based on whether the derived answer matches with the ground truths. Finally, a policy gradient based method was used to select the optimal combination of several rationale chains from the pool for CoT prompting.\n\nVery recently researchers have also turned their attention to augmenting LLM with additional agents for various purposes. This is also the research field that is most relevant to our current work. AutoGPT [23] is a program which combines GPT-4 with additional modules including an execution agent and a memory unit. It can chain together LLM \"thoughts\", in order to autonomously achieve whatever goal the user sets. PromptPG [24] proposes an approach that can learn to select in-context examples from a small amount of training data via policy gradient for prompt learning. The PromptPG agent learns to find optimal in-context examples from a candidate pool, with the goal of maximizing the prediction rewards on given training examples when interacting with the GPT-3 environment. DEPS [25] is a proposal that utilizes multi-step reasoning and sub-task error correction to tackle complex tasks with long-range dependencies. By being able to provide explanations for errors in sub-tasks within a trial, DEPS exhibits remarkable performance. ReAct [26] is an approach that employs emergent properties present in LLMs, such as traces of verbal reasoning, to enable agents to reason and take action, resulting in impressive performance on different text-based benchmarks. Building on top of ReAct, Reflexion [27] is an approach that equips an agent with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities, improving its existing reasoning trace and ability to choose task-specific actions. To achieve complete automation, a simple but effective heuristic was designed to enable the agent to identify hallucination instances and prevent repetitive action sequences. Our proposal shares some commonalities with these approaches, for example, the use of a memory module and additional agents for automatic prompt generation. However, our approach is unique in that it introduces a ToT controller which can explicitly conduct backtracking when necessary. This not only allows the system to recover from mistakes, but potentially can also enlarge the solution search space.\n\n## 3 Architecture\n\n### The Tree-of-Thought Framework\n\nFigure 0(b) depicts the software system that implements the ToT Framework. As mentioned earlier, it incorporates several components which enhance the problem solving capability of the LLM, including a _prompter agent_, a _checker module_, a _memory module_, and a _ToT controller_.\n\nThe problem solving process starts with the user inputting the problem description. The promoter agent then relays the problem to the LLM, with additional prompt text which encourages the LLM to come up with an intermediate solution instead of trying to reach the full solution in a single shot. After receiving the response from the LLM, the checker module is invoked to check the validity of the intermediate solution generated. If it passes the correctness check, the intermediate solution will be parsed and stored in the memory module. Then, based on the content of the memory module, the prompter agent generates a prompt to encourage the LLM to generate the next step. Conversely, if the LLM generates an invalid intermediate solution, the ToT controller will activate the prompter to offer hints to the LLM and request it to consider again. Note that in general, a valid intermediate solution does not always leads to the correct final solution. In order to prevent getting stuck, the ToT controller constantly monitors the search process and determines whether to continue trying from the current node or backtrack to a parent or an ancestor node and explore alternative directions.\n\nThe ToT strategy can be viewed as a tree-search algorithm using an LLM as a heuristic for generating the search steps. In this setting, the LLM is only used for the \"short-range reasoning\" tasks, i.e deriving the next intermediate solution, which is a type of tasks that have been shown to have a high success rate for LLMs [7]. On the other hand, by introducing the checker, the system have a higher likelihood to discover the mistakes it makes as it generates the solutions. Moreover, by allowing the system to backtrack from a valid but somewhat \"hopeless\" intermediate solution, the system is able to explore a larger solution space, which enhances the \"long-range reasoning\" capability of the system as a whole. The ToT framework thus combines the best of both world. Furthermore, this multi-round conversation technique increases the number of computation steps the system can perform. Thus, based on the time hierarchy theorem in computational complexity theory [28], the ToT framework can expand the range of problems that can potentially be solved compared to relying solely on a single round of conversation with an LLM.\n\n### ToT Modules\n\nIn this section we provide more details of the components of the ToT software system.\n\n**Checker Module**. The checker module can either be rule-based or implemented as a deep neural network. For problems that have an explicit polynomial time algorithm for correctness checking (i.e. problems in **NP**), rule-based checkers can be implemented. Numerous important mathematical and logical problems are in this category, for example, equation solving, polynomial factoring, 3SAT, and puzzles like Sudoku. With a rule-based checker, the ToT software can be viewed as a hybrid system which allows explicitly encoding prior knowledge (e.g. the Sudoku rules) into a neural network powered system. An alternative is to train and use a neural network based classifier as the checker [20]. This is especially useful for problems where a rule-based checker is difficult to implement, e.g. checking whether a mathematical proof is correct.\n\n**Memory Module**. The memory module can be used to store the entire conversation history between the LLM and the prompter agent, as well as other supplemental data useful for problem solving. The data stored can be served as the information source for the prompter agent to generate helpful hints for the LLM.\n\n**ToT Controller**. The ToT controller oversees the entire ToT search. It can be implemented in a number of ways. It can be as simple as encoding two rules: 1) if the checker thinks the current partial solution is invalid, backtrack to the parent node, and 2) if the current partial solution is valid, but the ToT search tree has explored its \\(C\\) children and yet failed to find the final solution, then backtrack to the parent node. Here \\(C\\) is an pre-configured integer.\n\nA more advanced version of the ToT controller can employ a policy network to determine the backtracking policy. The network's inputs include the recent search history comprised of the sequence of the last \\(k+1\\) node visited in the search tree \\(s_{i-k}\\), \\(..\\), \\(s_{i-1}\\), \\(s_{i}\\) (\\(k\\) is a hyper-parameter). The network also takes in \\(c_{i}\\), a Boolean variable which indicates whether the checker module considers the current node \\(s_{i}\\) is valid. We can sample from the policy to determine the next action \\(a_{i}\\):\n\n\\[a_{i}\\sim\\pi_{\\rho}^{t}(a|c_{i},s_{i},..,s_{i-k}),\\ a\\in A_{cand} \\tag{1}\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\pi_{\\rho}^{t}\\) represents the policy network of the ToT controller with parameters \\(\\rho\\). The set of candidate actions \\(A_{cand}\\) includes simply staying at the current node to generate the next step, and backtracking to the parent or an ancestor node at most \\(L\\) levels up in the search tree where \\(L\\) is a hyper-parameter. Thus, we can use one-hot encoding for the actions, where backtracking \\(j\\) levels up is represented by a vector where only the \\(j^{\\text{th}}\\) position is set to 1. The action vector \\(a\\) and checker output \\(c_{i}\\) are processed by a feed-forward network (FFN) to for deep features extraction. A linear layer with learnable parameters \\(\\mathbf{W}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}_{1}\\) is added on top of the FFN to map its output to a vector \\(\\mathbf{g}(a,c_{i})\\). The latest \\(k+1\\) visited nodes are concatenated into a string, and then added with position embedding (PE), and finally inputted into a self-attention model [1]. The idea is that by adding position embedding, the attention model will be able to make decisions based on the sequence of the recent node visits. A linear layer with learnable parameters \\(\\mathbf{W}_{2}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}_{2}\\) is added on top of the attention model to transform its output to a vector \\(\\mathbf{g}(s_{i},..,s_{i-k})\\) whose dimension matches with that of \\(\\mathbf{g}(a,c_{i})\\). Finally, we calculate the inner-products of these two vectors, and use the softmax function to compute the probability of each action candidate:\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\\mathbf{g}(a,c_{i})&=\\mathbf{W}_{1} \\cdot\\text{FFN}(a,c_{i})+\\mathbf{b}_{1}\\\\ \\mathbf{g}(s_{i},..,s_{i-k})&=\\mathbf{W}_{2}\\cdot \\text{Attention}(\\text{PE}(s_{i-k}||..||s_{i-1}||s_{i}))+\\mathbf{b}_{2}\\\\ \\pi_{\\rho}^{t}(a|c_{i},s_{i},..,s_{i-k})&=\\frac{ \\text{exp}(\\mathbf{g}(a,c_{i})\\cdot\\mathbf{g}(s_{i},..,s_{i-k}))}{\\sum_{a^{ \\prime}\\in A_{cand}}\\text{exp}(\\mathbf{g}(a^{\\prime},c_{i})\\cdot\\mathbf{g}(s_ {i},..,s_{i-k}))}\\end{split} \\tag{2}\\]\n\nIn the above formula, \"\\(||\\)\" is the string concatenation operator. Section 3.3 will discuss the training algorithm for the ToT controller policy network.\n\n**Prompter Agent**. The prompter agent gives hints to the LLM for it to generate the next search step. The most basic hint can be a generic prompt using the following template: \\(generic\\_tmpl=\\) \"_For the given problem: [problem description], we have come up with a partial solution: [partial solution summary]. Please derive the next step on top of this partial solution, and return the next step in the following JSON format [next_step: <next_step>]_\". Note that the template requires the LLM to respond with a structured JSON string. This is a trick to make it easier for the checker to extract the next step from the LLM response. To create an actual prompt from this template, the prompter needs the [problem description] and the [partial solution summary], both of which can be queried from the memory module.\n\nSimilar to the ToT controller, we can also implement the prompter agent as a policy network, which can generate prompts based on the current partial solution and the conversation history. First we define the prompt template as follows: \\(prompt\\_tmpl=generic\\_tmpl\\mid\\mid\\)_\"Here are a few examples: [in-context learning examples]_.\", where \\(||\\) is the string concatenation operator. The variable _[in context learning examples]_ are in-context learning examples for the problem being solved, which can be picked by the prompter policy network from a set of candidates, similar to the PromptPG approach [24]. The rationale is that given the current and recently attempted intermediate solution, some in-context examples might work better than others as hints for the next step. Given the recently visited node sequence \\(s_{i-k}\\), \\(..\\), \\(s_{i-1}\\), \\(s_{i}\\), our goal is to select \\(l\\) examples \\(e_{i}=\\{e_{i}^{1},e_{i}^{2},...,e_{i}^{l}|e_{i}^{j}\\in E_{cand}\\}\\) where \\(E_{cand}\\) is a pool of in-context learning example candidates. The examples are selected according on a policy:\n\n\\[e_{i}^{j}\\sim\\pi_{\\theta}^{p}(e|s_{i},..,s_{i-k}),\\ e_{i}^{j}\\in E _{cand}\\ \\text{for}\\ j=1,2,...,l \\tag{3}\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\pi_{\\theta}^{p}\\) represents the policy network of the prompter agent with parameters \\(\\theta\\). With the set of selected examples, the prompter agent generates a prompt from the template: \\(p_{i}=prompter(prompt\\_tmpl,e_{i},s_{i})\\), which can be fed into the LLM to obtain the next intermediate solution \\(s_{i+1}=LLM(p_{i})\\). The neural network architecture for the prompter's policy network is similar to that of the ToT controller. The only difference is that since the in-context examples are expressed in natural language, instead of FFN, we use an attention model to process them:\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\\mathbf{h}(e)&=\\mathbf{M}_{1}\\cdot \\text{Attention}(e)+\\mathbf{c}_{1}\\\\ \\mathbf{h}(s_{i},..,s_{i-k})&=\\mathbf{M}_{2}\\cdot \\text{Attention}(\\text{PE}(s_{i-k}||..||s_{i-1}||s_{i}))+\\mathbf{c}_{2}\\\\ \\pi_{\\theta}^{p}(e|s_{i},..,s_{i-k})&=\\frac{\\text{ exp}(\\mathbf{h}(e)\\cdot\\mathbf{h}(s_{i},..,s_{i-k}))}{\\sum_{e^{\\prime} \\in E_{cand}}\\text{exp}(\\mathbf{h}(e^{\\prime})\\cdot\\mathbf{h}(s_{i},..,s_{i-k} ))}\\end{split} \\tag{4}\\]\n\nThe prompter policy network can be trained together with the ToT controller using multi-agent reinforcement learning methods. The training algorithm of the prompter's policy network is discussed in Section 3.3.\n\n### ToT System Training\n\nIn the previous sections, we have described the multi-agent ToT framework. This section dives into how we can train the agents, in particular, the policy networks of the ToT controller and the prompter agent. While there are many multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms (MARL) proposed in the literature [29; 30; 31], in this work we adopt a relatively simple approach which uses a modified version of the REINFORCE algorithm [32] to train the policy networks of the ToT controller and the prompter agent directly. The more advanced MARL algorithms will be explored in the future.\n\nFirst, we define a run of the ToT system as the process where a user inputs the problem description, and the ToT system attempts to solve the problem until it thinks the problem is solved, or a pre-specified maximum round of conversations is reached. Next, we define the reward \\(r\\) of a run: if the problem is correctly solved, then \\(r=+1\\). Otherwise, if the system outputs an incorrect solution, or the maximum round of conversations is reached, then \\(r=-1\\).\n\nThe training algorithm is provided in Algorithm 1. The algorithm takes two inputs, the training data set \\(P_{train}\\), and the number of training epochs \\(N\\) (Line 1-2). The two policy networks \\(\\pi_{\\rho}^{t}(a_{i}|s_{i_{i}},..,s_{i-k})\\) and \\(\\pi_{\\rho}^{p}(e_{i}|s_{i_{i}},..,s_{i-k})\\) are randomly initialized (Line 3-4). We train the two policy networks in turns, i.e. training one network with policy gradient while keeping the other fixed (Line 6). To be more specific, when the current \\(epoch\\) is an even number, we select the ToT controller policy \\(\\pi_{\\rho}^{t}\\), and keep the parameters of the prompter agent fixed. Otherwise, we select the prompter agent policy \\(\\pi_{\\rho}^{p}\\) and fix the ToT controller policy. Next, the algorithm updates the parameters of the selected policy network using the policy gradient method (Line 7-9). For each problem in the training data, we attempt to solve it with a ToT system run. Based on the result, we obtain the reward for that run (Line 8). The entire training algorithm runs for \\(N\\) epochs.\n\n```\n1:Input: problem description from the user \\(p_{user}\\), max num of conversation rounds \\(K\\)\n2:procedureSOLVE(\\(p_{user}\\), \\(K\\))\n3:\\(prompt\\leftarrow\\) Prompter(\\(p_{user}\\))\n4:for\\(round\\) = 1, 2,.., \\(K\\)do\n5:\\(response\\leftarrow\\) LLM(\\(prompt\\))\n6:\\(result\\leftarrow\\) Checker(\\(response\\))\n7:if\\(result.\\)isValidFinalSolution() then\n8:return (\\(result.solution\\))\n9:endif\n10: memory.store(\\(result\\))\n11:\\(ctrl\\_signal\\leftarrow\\) ToTController(memory)\n12:\\(prompt\\leftarrow\\) Prompter(memory, \\(ctrl\\_signal\\))\n13:endfor\n14:return (\\(nil\\))\n15:endprocedure\n```\n\n**Algorithm 2** Problem Solving Using the ToT System\n\n### Problem Solving Using the ToT System\n\nAfter the ToT system is trained, we can use it for inference, i.e. problem solving. Algorithm 2 provides the pseudo code for solving problems using the ToT system. It starts with a user inputting description of the problem (Line 1-2). The prompter module then converts the user input into a prompt (Line 3) using a prompt template for user input, for example: \\(user\\_input\\_prompt=\\) \"_For the given problem: [problem description], please derive the first step, and return the step in the following JSON format [next_step: <next_step>]_\".\n\nNext, up to \\(K\\) rounds of conversations with the LLM are conducted for problem solving (Line 4). In each round, the LLM first produces a response for the given prompt (Line 5). Then, the checker analyzes the response, and returns a result (Line 6). The result contains the partial solution extracted from the LLM response, as well as information like whether the checker considers the solution as a valid final solution, a valid intermediate solution, or an invalid partial solution, etc. If the solution is a valid final solution, the algorithm simply returns it (Line 7-9). Otherwise, the result is stored in the memory module (Line 10). Based on the content of the memory module, the ToT controller issues control signals, e.g. backtracking for \\(l\\) levels, to the prompter (Line 11). Finally, based on the control signal, the prompter looks up the relevant information from the memory module, and produce the next prompt for the LLM (Line 12). If no valid final solution is found within \\(K\\) rounds of conversations, the algorithm return \\(nil\\) indicating it fails to solve the problem (Line 14).\n\n## 4 Evaluation\n\nThis section provides the evaluation methodology and experimental results for our proposed ToT framework. Our evaluation focuses on the ToT-based solver for the Sudoku problem. At the first glance, Sudoku problems seem to be just brain teasers with little practical importance. However, the generalized Sudoku problem on \\(n^{2}\\times n^{2}\\) grids of \\(n\\times n\\) blocks is known to be NP-complete [33]. If the ToT framework can solve instances of the generalized Sudoku problem (granted that it might takes an exponential number of rounds of conversations), in principle it can handle many other mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. In fact, it is straightforward to re-purpose the implementation described below to solve other puzzles, such as 3SAT, 3-coloring, etc. Below we first describe the implementation details of the solver. Then, we present the test suite used in our evaluation, as well as the experimental results.\n\n### ToT Solver for Sudoku Puzzles\n\nThe ToT-based Sudoku solver follows the generic framework described in Section 3 with some specific tweaks for the Sudoku problem. It allows a user to input a Sudoku puzzle using natural languages, for example: \"Please solve this 4x4 Sudoku puzzle [[3,**,2],[1,*,3,*],[*,1,*,3],[4,**,1]] where * represents a cell to be filled\".\n\nWe have implemented the ToT-based Sudoku solver as described in Section 4.1 in Python. We adopted a rule-based approach for the **checker module** since the Sudoku rules are precise and easy to check. The **memory module** stores the conversation history between the prompter and the LLM, as well as a search tree which maintains all the partially filled Sudoku board the LLM has generated so far. This way, when backtracking happens, the previous board configuration can be retrieved. The **ToT controller** in our implementation is also rule-based. It returns to the parent node in the search tree if either the current node considered invalid by the checker, or the search algorithm has explored more than 5 children of the current node. Finally the **prompter agent** uses a variation of the generic template mentioned above, with the _[problem description]_ being the initial configuration of the Sudoku board input by the user, and _[partial solution summary]_ being the partially filled board represented by the current node in the search tree. The LLM utilized in this study is the \"gpt-3.5-turbo\" model, which is accessible through the OpenAI API suite. The _temperature_ parameter was set to 1 in our experiments.\n\n### Experimental Results\n\nWe have implemented four LLM-based Sudoku puzzle solvers and compared their performance: 1) zero-shot solver (**zs**) which directly posts the puzzle description to the LLM, 2) one-shot solver (**os**) which provides a chain-of-thought style step-by-step solution of a 3x3 Sudoku puzzle as an example in addition to the problem description, 3) few-shot solver (**fs**) which provides multiple examples with CoT-style solutions, and 4) our proposed Tree-of-Thought solver (**tot**). We constructed three benchmarks, comprising of ten 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5 Sudoku puzzles, respectively. The objective of a solver is to fill the \\(n\\times n\\) Sudoku grid with digits so that each row and column contain all of the digits from 1 to \\(n\\) (\\(n=3,4,5\\) in our experiments).\n\nFigure 2 compares the success rates of different LLM-based solvers across the three benchmarks. Here the term _success rate_ refers to the fraction of problems in a benchmark set that are successfully solved by a solver. For example, if a solver is able to solve 4 out of 10 problems in the \"3x3 puzzles\" benchmark set, then the success rate of this solver for this benchmark set is 0.4. As expected, the zero-shot solver has the worst performance across all the three set of benchmarks. Adding CoT-style step-by-step examples significantly boosts the success rate, especially for the 3x3 puzzles. This is expected, since one can pretty much rely on \"short-range\" reasoning skills, which is a strength of the\n\nFigure 2: Experimental results comparing the success rate of different LLM-based Sudoku puzzle solvers across three sets of benchmarks.\n\nLLM models, to solve a small-sized 3x3 Sudoku puzzle, especially when CoT-style hints are provided. However, as the puzzle size gets bigger, the success rate of the one-shot and few-shot solver dropped to around 0.5. This is because solving bigger puzzles requires trial and error, which is a capability LLMs generally lack of as discussed earlier.\n\nIn comparison, the ToT-based solver demonstrates superior performance when compared to the other solvers. For the 3x3 benchmark set, it was able to solve all the puzzles. The success rate improves by 11% compared to the second best for the two benchmark sets. For the 4x4 benchmark set, the ToT-based solver failed to find the solution for 1 out of the 10 puzzles before reaching the maximum round of conversations (which is set to 100 in our experiments). We suspect it is due to the limited capability of the rule-based ToT controller. In particular, the rule-based controller has no sense of whether the current partially-filled board can be completed without violating the Sudoku rules, which decreases the efficiency of the solution search. We expect a neural network based ToT controller will perform better, which we will verify in the future extension of this work. Despite this, the success rate of the ToT based solver is still 80% higher compared to that of the one-shot and few-shot based solvers. Finally, for the 5x5 puzzles, the ToT-based solver failed with 2 puzzles before reaching the maximum round of conversations. Nonetheless, the success rate is 60% higher compared to that of the one-shot and few-shot based solvers.\n\n## 5 Discussions and Future Works\n\nIn this paper, we presented the Tree-of-Thought framework, which enhances LLMs with additional agents and memory modules, resulting in improved performance for mathematical problem-solving tasks. To evaluate the performance of this technique, we implemented a Sudoku puzzle solver based on the ToT framework. One of the limitations of the current implementation is that it utilizes a rule-based checker that contains custom logic, making it less easily adaptable to other problems. For more generic problems, for example, general mathematical and logical reasoning problems, where rule-based solution checking is difficult to implement, a future direction is to explore checkers based on neural network or other probabilistic models. Moreover, the experiments we conducted in this work also uses a rule-based ToT controller, which as we pointed out, has limited capabilities. In the future, we will implement the neural network based ToT controller which can hopefully enhance the system performance. Additionally, the policy-gradient based training algorithm proposed in this work is relatively simple and may be susceptible to training stability issues. To further optimize the ToT system, more advanced multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly those designed for cooperative agents, could be adopted.\n\nAnother intriguing future direction is to investigate the potential of utilizing the \"self-play\" technique to enable the ToT system to develop novel problem solving strategies that are not found in the LLM's training text corpus. The self-play training method is a reinforcement learning technique which was popularized by the development of competitive game-playing agents such as AlphaGo and AlphaStar [34; 35; 36], where an AI agent learns to improve its own strategy by playing against itself. Today's LLMs are typically trained using self-supervised learning techniques. They may have limitations when it comes to problem-solving, as they may not be able to generate samples (i.e. novel problem solving strategies) that fall outside the distribution of the training data. In other words, they may not be able to \"think outside the box\", which is a crucial human trait that facilitates the discovery of new knowledge. Compared to self-supervised learning, self-play based reinforcement learning enables the system to access a much broader solution space beyond the provided training examples, allowing for greater improvement. AlphaGo and similar systems have demonstrated the ability to devise strategies that surpass even those of human experts. Inspired by these examples, for ToT system training, instead of relying on the training data set \\(P_{train}\\), we can introduce a \"quizzer\" module which can come up with problem descriptions on its own to train the ToT controller and the prompter agent. It is worth mentioning that one of the key enablers for training AlphaGo and similar system is that the environment reward can be precisely determined, as it is straightforward to determine whether the gameplay results in a win or a loss. The ToT framework incorporates a checker that can assess the correctness of the solution, functioning similarly to the environment, particularly for problems that have well-defined solution validation rules. Thus, the reinforcement learning training methods can be readily applied. We suspect that this self-driven learning approach, similar to the self-play method, could be an effective means of improving the ToT framework's problem-solving capabilities beyond the solution examples provided in the training text corpus for the LLMs.\n\n## References\n\n* [1] Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan N.

In this paper, we\nexplore the use of LLMs to generate both reasoning traces and task-specific actions\nin an interleaved manner, allowing for greater synergy between the two: reasoning\ntraces help the model induce, track, and update action plans as well as handle\nexceptions, while actions allow it to interface with and gather additional information\nfrom external sources such as knowledge bases or environments. We apply our\napproach, named ReAct, to a diverse set of language and decision making tasks\nand demonstrate its effectiveness over state-of-the-art baselines in addition to\nimproved human interpretability and trustworthiness. Concretely, on question\nanswering (HotpotQA) and fact verification (Fever), ReAct overcomes prevalent\nissues of hallucination and error propagation in chain-of-thought reasoning by\ninteracting with a simple Wikipedia API, and generating human-like task-solving\ntrajectories that are more interpretable than baselines without reasoning traces.\nFurthermore, on two interactive decision making benchmarks (ALFWorld and\nWebShop), ReAct outperforms imitation and reinforcement learning methods by\nan absolute success rate of 34% and 10% respectively, while being prompted with\nonly one or two in-context examples.\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nA unique feature of human intelligence is the ability to seamlessly combine task-oriented actions with\nverbal reasoning (or inner speech, Alderson-Day & Fernyhough, 2015), which has been theorized to\nplay an important role in human cognition for enabling self-regulation or strategization (Vygotsky,\n1987; Luria, 1965; Fernyhough, 2010) and maintaining a working memory (Baddeley, 1992). Consider the example of cooking up a dish in the kitchen. Between any two specific actions, we may\nreason in language in order to track progress (\u201cnow that everything is cut, I should heat up the pot of\nwater\u201d), to handle exceptions or adjust the plan according to the situation (\u201cI don\u2019t have salt, so let\nme use soy sauce and pepper instead\u201d), and to realize when external information is needed (\u201chow do\nI prepare dough? Let me search on the Internet\u201d). We may also act (open a cookbook to read the\nrecipe, open the fridge, check ingredients) to support the reasoning and to answer questions (\u201cWhat\ndish can I make right now?\u201d). This tight synergy between \u201cacting\u201d and \u201creasoning\u201d allows humans\nto learn new tasks quickly and perform robust decision making or reasoning, even under previously\nunseen circumstances or facing information uncertainties.\nRecent results have hinted at the possibility of combining verbal reasoning with interactive decision\nmaking in autonomous systems.

1: (1) Comparison of 4 prompting methods, (a) Standard, (b) Chain-of-thought (CoT,\nReason Only), (c) Act-only, and (d) ReAct (Reason+Act), solving a HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018)\nquestion. (2) Comparison of (a) Act-only and (b) ReAct prompting to solve an AlfWorld (Shridhar\net al., 2020b) game. In both domains, we omit in-context examples in the prompt, and only show task\nsolving trajectories generated by the model (Act, Thought) and the environment (Obs).\nanswers from questions in arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks (Wei et al.,\n2022). However, this \u201cchain-of-thought\u201d reasoning is a static black box, in that the model uses\nits own internal representations to generate thoughts and is not grounded in the external world,\nwhich limits its ability to reason reactively or update its knowledge. This can lead to issues like fact\nhallucination and error propagation over the reasoning process (Figure 1 (1b)). On the other hand,\nrecent work has explored the use of pre-trained language models for planning and acting in interactive\nenvironments (Ahn et al., 2022; Nakano et al., 2021; Yao et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2022a), with\na focus on predicting actions via language priors. These approaches usually convert multi-modal\nobservations into text, use a language model to generate domain-specific actions or plans, and then\nuse a controller to choose or execute them. However, they do not employ language models to reason\nabstractly about high-level goals or maintain a working memory to support acting, barring Huang\net al. (2022b) who perform a limited form of verbal reasoning to reiterate spatial facts about the\ncurrent state. Beyond such simple embodied tasks to interact with a few blocks, there have not been\nstudies on how reasoning and acting can be combined in a synergistic manner for general task solving,\nand if such a combination can bring systematic benefits compared to reasoning or acting alone.\nIn this work, we present ReAct, a general paradigm to combine reasoning and acting with language\nmodels for solving diverse language reasoning and decision making tasks (Figure 1). ReAct\nprompts LLMs to generate both verbal reasoning traces and actions pertaining to a task in an\ninterleaved manner, which allows the model to perform dynamic reasoning to create, maintain, and\nadjust high-level plans for acting (reason to act), while also interact with the external environments\n(e.g. Wikipedia) to incorporate additional information into reasoning (act to reason).\n2\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\nWe conduct empirical evaluations of ReAct and state-of-the-art baselines on four diverse benchmarks:\nquestion answering (HotPotQA, Yang et al., 2018), fact verification (Fever, Thorne et al., 2018),\ntext-based game (ALFWorld, Shridhar et al., 2020b), and webpage navigation (WebShop, Yao\net al., 2022). For HotPotQA and Fever, with access to a Wikipedia API that the model can interact\nwith, ReAct outperforms vanilla action generation models while being competitive with chain-ofthought reasoning (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022). The best approach overall is a combination of ReAct\nand CoT that allows for the use of both internal knowledge and externally obtained information\nduring reasoning. On ALFWorld and WebShop, two or even one-shot ReAct prompting is able\nto outperform imitation or reinforcement learning methods trained with 103 \u223c 105 task instances,\nwith an absolute improvement of 34% and 10% in success rates respectively. We also demonstrate\nthe importance of sparse, versatile reasoning in decision making by showing consistent advantages\nover controlled baselines with actions only. Besides general applicability and performance boost,\nthe combination of reasoning and acting also contributes to model interpretability, trustworthiness,\nand diagnosability across all domains, as humans can readily distinguish information from model\u2019s\ninternal knowledge versus external environments, as well as inspect reasoning traces to understand\nthe decision basis of model actions.\nTo summarize, our key contributions are the following: (1) we introduce ReAct, a novel promptbased paradigm to synergize reasoning and acting in language models for general task solving; (2) we\nperform extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks to showcase the advantage of ReAct in a\nfew-shot learning setup over prior approaches that perform either reasoning or action generation in\nisolation; (3) we present systematic ablations and analysis to understand the importance of acting in\nreasoning tasks, and reasoning in interactive tasks; (4) we analyze the limitations of ReAct under the\nprompting setup (i.e. limited support of reasoning and acting behaviors), and perform initial finetuning\nexperiments showing the potential of ReAct to improve with additional training data. Scaling up\nReAct to train and operate on more tasks and combining it with complementary paradigms like\nreinforcement learning could further unlock the potential of large language models.\n2\nREAC T: SYNERGIZING REASONING + ACTING\nConsider a general setup of an agent interacting with an environment for task solving. At time\nstep t, an agent receives an observation ot \u2208 O from the environment and takes an action at \u2208 A\nfollowing some policy \u03c0(at|ct), where ct = (o1, a1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , ot\u22121, at\u22121, ot) is the context to the agent.\nLearning a policy is challenging when the mapping ct \ufffd\u2192 at is highly implicit and requires extensive\ncomputation. For example, the agent shown in Figure 1(1c) is unable to generate the correct final\naction (Act 4) to finish the QA task as it requires complex reasoning over the trajectory context\n(Question, Act 1-3, Obs 1-3). Similarly, the agent shown in Figure 1(2a) fails to comprehend from the\ncontext that sinkbasin 1 does not contain peppershaker 1, thus keep producing hallucinating actions.\nThe idea of ReAct is simple: we augment the agent\u2019s action space to \u02c6\nA = A \u222a L, where L is the\nspace of language. An action \u02c6at \u2208 L in the language space, which we will refer to as a thought or a\nreasoning trace, does not affect the external environment, thus leading to no observation feedback.\nInstead, a thought \u02c6at aims to compose useful information by reasoning over the current context ct,\nand update the context ct+1 = (ct, \u02c6at) to support future reasoning or acting. As shown in Figure 1,\nthere could be various types of useful thoughts, e.g. decomposing task goals and create action plans\n(2b, Act 1; 1d, Thought 1), injecting commonsense knowledge relevant to task solving (2b, Act 1),\nextracting important parts from observations (1d, Thought2, 4), track progress and transit action plans\n(2b, Act 8), handle exceptions and adjust action plans (1d, Thought 3), and so on.\nHowever, as the language space L is unlimited, learning in this augmented action space is difficult\nand requires strong language priors. In this paper, we mainly focus on the setup where a frozen\nlarge language model, PaLM-540B (Chowdhery et al., 2022)1, is prompted with few-shot in-context\nexamples to generate both domain-specific actions and free-form language thoughts for task solving\n(Figure 1 (1d), (2b)). Each in-context example is a human trajectory of actions, thoughts, and\nenvironment observations to solve a task instance (see Appendix C). For the tasks where reasoning is\nof primary importance (Figure 1(1)), we alternate the generation of thoughts and actions so that the\ntask-solving trajectory consists of multiple thought-action-observation steps. In contrast, for decision\nmaking tasks that potentially involve a large number of actions (Figure 1(2)), thoughts only need to\n1We show some GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) results in Appendix A.1, which outperforms PaLM-540B.\n3\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\nappear sparsely in the most relevant positions of a trajectory, so we let the language model decide the\nasynchronous occurrence of thoughts and actions for itself.\nSince decision making and reasoning capabilities are integrated into a large language model, ReAct\nenjoys several unique features: A) Intuitive and easy to design: Designing ReAct prompts is\nstraightforward as human annotators just type down their thoughts in language on top of their actions\ntaken. No ad-hoc format choice, thought design, or example selection is used in this paper. We detail\nprompt design for each task in Sections 3 and 4. B) General and flexible: Due to the flexible thought\nspace and thought-action occurrence format, ReAct works for diverse tasks with distinct action\nspaces and reasoning needs, including but not limited to QA, fact verification, text game, and web\nnavigation. C) Performant and robust: ReAct shows strong generalization to new task instances\nwhile learning solely from one to six in-context examples, consistently outperforming baselines with\nonly reasoning or acting across different domains. We also show in Section 3 additional benefits\nwhen finetuning is enabled, and in Section 4 how ReAct performance is robust to prompt selections.\nD) Human aligned and controllable: ReAct promises an interpretable sequential decision making\nand reasoning process where humans can easily inspect reasoning and factual correctness. Moreover,\nhumans can also control or correct the agent behavior on the go by thought editing, as shown in\nFigure 5 in Section 4.\n3\nKNOWLEDGE-INTENSIVE REASONING TASKS\nWe begin with knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks like multi-hop question answering and fact\nverification. As shown in Figure 1(1d), by interacting with a Wikipedia API, ReAct is able to\nretrieve information to support reasoning, while also use reasoning to target what to retrieve next,\ndemonstrating a synergy of reasoning and acting.\n3.1\nSETUP\nDomains\nWe consider two datasets challenging knowledge retrieval and reasoning: (1) HotPotQA (Yang et al., 2018), a multi-hop question answering benchmark that requires reasoning\nover two or more Wikipedia passages, and (2) FEVER (Thorne et al., 2018), a fact verification\nbenchmark where each claim is annotated SUPPORTS, REFUTES, or NOT ENOUGH INFO, based\non if there exists a Wikipedia passage to verify the claim. In this work, we operate in a question-only\nsetup for both tasks, where models only receive the question/claim as input without access to support\nparagraphs, and have to rely on their internal knowledge or retrieve knowledge via interacting with\nan external environment to support reasoning.\nAction Space\nWe design a simple Wikipedia web API with three types of actions to support\ninteractive information retrieval: (1) search[entity], which returns the first 5 sentences from\nthe corresponding entity wiki page if it exists, or else suggests top-5 similar entities from the\nWikipedia search engine, (2) lookup[string], which would return the next sentence in the page\ncontaining string, simulating Ctrl+F functionality on the browser. (3) finish[answer], which\nwould finish the current task with answer. We note that this action space mostly can only retrieve a\nsmall part of a passage based on exact passage name, which is significantly weaker than state-of-theart lexical or neural retrievers. The purpose is to simulate how humans would interact with Wikipedia,\nand force models to retrieve via explicit reasoning in language.\n3.2\nMETHODS\nReAct Prompting\nFor HotpotQA and Fever, we randomly select 6 and 3 cases2 from the training\nset and manually compose ReAct-format trajectories to use as few-shot exemplars in the prompts.\nSimilar to Figure 1(d), each trajectory consists of multiple thought-action-observation steps (i.e. dense\nthought), where free-form thoughts are used for various purposes. Specifically, we use a combination\nof thoughts that decompose questions (\u201cI need to search x, find y, then find z\u201d), extract information\nfrom Wikipedia observations (\u201cx was started in 1844\u201d, \u201cThe paragraph does not tell x\u201d), perform\ncommonsense (\u201cx is not y, so z must instead be...\u201d) or arithmetic reasoning (\u201c1844 < 1989\u201d), guide\n2We find more examples do not improve performance.\n4\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\nPrompt Methoda\nHotpotQA\nFever\n(EM)\n(Acc)\nStandard\n28.7\n57.1\nCoT (Wei et al., 2022)\n29.4\n56.3\nCoT-SC (Wang et al., 2022a)\n33.4\n60.4\nAct\n25.7\n58.9\nReAct\n27.4\n60.9\nCoT-SC \u2192 ReAct\n34.2\n64.6\nReAct\u2192 CoT-SC\n35.1\n62.0\nSupervised SoTAb\n67.5\n89.5\nTable 1: PaLM-540B prompting results on\nHotpotQA and Fever.\naHotpotQA EM is 27.1, 28.9, 33.8 for Standard, CoT,\nCoT-SC in Wang et al.

See Appendix C for more details.\nBaselines\nWe systematically ablate ReAct trajectories to build prompts for multiple baselines (with\nformats as Figure 1(1a-1c)): (a) Standard prompting (Standard), which removes all thoughts,\nactions, observations in ReAct trajectories. (b) Chain-of-thought prompting (CoT) (Wei et al.,\n2022), which removes actions and observations and serve as a reasoning-only baseline. We also\nbuild a self-consistency baseline (CoT-SC) (Wang et al., 2022a;b) by sampling 21 CoT trajectories\nwith decoding temperature 0.7 during inference and adopting the majority answer, which is found to\nconsistently boost performance over CoT. (c) Acting-only prompt (Act), which removes thoughts\nin ReAct trajectories, loosely resembling how WebGPT (Nakano et al., 2021) interacts with the\nInternet to answer questions, though it operates on a different task and action space, and uses imitation\nand reinforcement learning instead of prompting.\nCombining Internal and External Knowledge\nAs will be detail in Section 3.3, we observe that\nthe problem solving process demonstrated by ReAct is more factual and grounded, whereas CoT\nis more accurate in formulating reasoning structure but can easily suffer from hallucinated facts\nor thoughts. We therefore propose to incorporate ReAct and CoT-SC, and let the model decide\nwhen to switch to the other method based on the following heuristics: A) ReAct \u2192 CoT-SC: when\nReAct fails to return an answer within given steps, back off to CoT-SC. We set 7 and 5 steps for\nHotpotQA and FEVER respectively as we find more steps will not improve ReAct performance3.\nB) CoT-SC \u2192 ReAct: when the majority answer among n CoT-SC samples occurs less than n/2\ntimes (i.e. internal knowledge might not support the task confidently), back off to ReAct.\nFinetuning\nDue to the challenge of manually annotating reasoning traces and actions at scale,\nwe consider a bootstraping approach similar to Zelikman et al. (2022), using 3,000 trajectories\nwith correct answers generated by ReAct (also for other baselines) to finetune smaller language\nmodels (PaLM-8/62B) to decode trajectories (all thoughts, actions, observations) conditioned on\ninput questions/claims. More details are in Appendix B.1.\n3.3\nRESULTS AND OBSERVATIONS\nReAct outperforms Act consistently\nTable 1 shows HotpotQA and Fever results using PaLM540B as the base model with different prompting methods. We note that ReAct is better than Act\non both tasks, demonstrating the value of reasoning to guide acting, especially for synthesizing the\nfinal answer, as shown in Figure 1 (1c-d). Fine-tuning results 3 also confirm the benefit of reasoning\ntraces for more informed acting.\n3Of all trajectories with correct final answers, those with 7 steps on HotpotQA and 5 steps on FEVER only\ntake up 0.84% and 1.33% respectively.\n5\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\nType\nDefinition\nReAct\nCoT\nSuccess\nTrue positive\nCorrect reasoning trace and facts\n94%\n86%\nFalse positive\nHallucinated reasoning trace or facts\n6%\n14%\nFailure\nReasoning error\nWrong reasoning trace (including failing to recover from repetitive steps)\n47%\n16%\nSearch result error\nSearch return empty or does not contain useful information\n23%\n-\nHallucination\nHallucinated reasoning trace or facts\n0%\n56%\nLabel ambiguity\nRight prediction but did not match the label precisely\n29%\n28%\nTable 2: Types of success and failure modes of ReAct and CoT on HotpotQA, as well as their\npercentages in randomly selected examples studied by human.\nReAct vs. CoT\nOn the other hand, ReAct outperforms CoT on Fever (60.9 vs. 56.3) and slightly\nlags behind CoT on HotpotQA (27.4 vs. 29.4). Fever claims for SUPPORTS/REFUTES might only\ndiffer by a slight amount (see Appendix D.1), so acting to retrieve accurate and up-to-date knowledge\nis vital. To better understand the behavioral difference between ReAct and CoT on HotpotQA, we\nrandomly sampled 50 trajectories with correct and incorrect answers (judged by EM) from ReAct\nand CoT respectively (thus 200 examples in total), and manually labeled their success and failure\nmodes in Table 2. Some key observations are as follows:\nA) Hallucination is a serious problem for CoT, resulting in much higher false positive rate than\nReAct (14% vs. 6%) in success mode, and make up its major failure mode (56%). In contrast, the\nproblem solving trajectory of ReActis more grounded, fact-driven, and trustworthy, thanks to the\naccess of an external knowledge base.\nB) While interleaving reasoning, action and observation steps improves ReAct\u2019s groundedness and trustworthiness, such a structural constraint also reduces its flexibility in formulating\nreasoning steps, leading to more reasoning error rate than CoT. we note that there is one frequent\nerror pattern specific to ReAct, in which the model repetitively generates the previous thoughts and\nactions, and we categorize it as part of \u201creasoning error\u201d as the model fails to reason about what the\nproper next action to take and jump out of the loop4.\nC) For ReAct, successfully retrieving informative knowledge via search is critical. Noninformative search, which counts for 23% of the error cases, derails the model reasoning and gives\nit a hard time to recover and reformulate thoughts. This is perhaps an expected trade-off between\nfactuality and flexibility, which motivates our proposed strategies of combining two methods.\nWe provide examples for each success and failure modes in Appendix E.1. We also find some\nHotpotQA questions may contain outdated answer labels, see Figure 4 for example.\nReAct + CoT-SC perform best for prompting LLMs\nAlso shown in Table 1, the best prompting\nmethod on HotpotQA and Fever are ReAct \u2192 CoT-SC and CoT-SC \u2192 ReAct respectively.\nFurthermore, Figure 2 shows how different methods perform with respect to the number of CoT-SC\nsamples used. While two ReAct + CoT-SC methods are advantageous at one task each, they both\nsignificantly and consistently outperform CoT-SC across different number of samples, reaching\nCoT-SC performance with 21 samples using merely 3-5 samples. These results indicate the value of\nproperly combining model internal knowledge and external knowledge for reasoning tasks.\nReAct performs best for fine-tuning\nFigure 3 shows the scaling effect of prompting/finetuning\nfour methods (Standard, CoT, Act, ReAct) on HotpotQA. With PaLM-8/62B, prompting ReAct\nperforms worst among four methods due to the difficulty to learn both reasoning and acting from\nin-context examples. However, when finetuned with just 3,000 examples, ReAct becomes the best\nmethod among the four, with PaLM-8B finetuned ReAct outperforming all PaLM-62B prompting\nmethods, and PaLM-62B finetuned ReAct outperforming all 540B prompting methods. In contrast,\nfinetuning Standard or CoT is significantly worse than finetuning ReAct or Act for both PaLM8/62B, as the former essentially teaches models to memorize (potentially halluincated) knowledge\nfacts, and the latter teaches models how to (reason and) act to access information from Wikipedia, a\nmore generalizable skill for knowledge reasoning. As all prompting methods are still significantly\nfar from domain-specific state-of-the-art approaches (Table 1), we believe finetuning with more\nhuman-written data might be a better way to unleash the power of ReAct.\n4We suspect that this could be due to the sub-optimal greedy decoding procedure, and future work using\nbetter decoding (e.g. beam search) might help address this issue.\n6\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\n8b\n62b\n540b\nsize\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\nHotpotQA EM\nlearning = prompt\n8b\n62b\n540b\nsize\nlearning = finetune\nMethod\nStandard\nCoT\nAct\nReAct\nFigure 3: Scaling results for prompting and finetuning on HotPotQA with ReAct (ours) and baselines.\n4\nDECISION MAKING TASKS\nWe also test ReAct on two language-based interactive decision-making tasks, ALFWorld and\nWebShop, both of which feature complex environments that require agents to act over long horizons\nwith sparse rewards, warranting the need for reasoning to act and explore effectively.\nALFWorld\nALFWorld (Shridhar et al., 2020b) (Figure 1(2)) is a synthetic text-based game designed\nto align with the embodied ALFRED benchmark (Shridhar et al., 2020a). It includes 6 types of\ntasks in which an agent needs to achieve a high-level goal (e.g. examine paper under desklamp) by\nnavigating and interacting with a simulated household via text actions (e.g. go to coffeetable 1, take\npaper 2, use desklamp 1). A task instance can have more than 50 locations and take an expert policy\nmore than 50 steps to solve, thus challenging an agent to plan and track subgoals, as well as explore\nsystematically (e.g. check all desks one by one for desklamp). In particular, one challenge built into\nALFWorld is the need to determine likely locations for common household items (e.g. desklamps will\nlikely be on desks, shelfs, or dressers), making this environment a good fit for LLMs to exploit their\npretrained commonsense knowledge. To prompt ReAct, we randomly annotate three trajectories\nfrom the training set for each task type, where each trajectory includes sparse thoughts that (1)\ndecompose the goal, (2) track subgoal completion, (3) determine the next subgoal, and (4) reason via\ncommonsense where to find an object and what to do with it. We show prompts used for ALFWorld\nin Appendix C.4. Following Shridhar et al. (2020b), we evaluate on 134 unseen evaluation games\nin a task-specific setup. For robustness, we construct 6 prompts for each task type through each\npermutation of 2 annotated trajectories from the 3 we annotate. Act prompts are constructed using\nthe same trajectories, but without thoughts \u2014 since task instances are randomly chosen from the\ntraining set, it favors neither ReAct nor Act and provides a fair and controlled comparison to test the\nimportance of sparse thoughts. For baselines, we use BUTLER (Shridhar et al., 2020b), an imitation\nlearning agent trained on 105 expert trajectories for each task type5.\nWebShop\nCan ReAct also interact with noisy real-world language environments for practical\napplications? We investigate WebShop (Yao et al., 2022), a recently proposed online shopping\nwebsite environment with 1.18M real-world products and 12k human instructions. Unlike ALFWorld,\nWebshop contains a high variety of structured and unstructured texts (e.g. product titles, descriptions,\nand options crawled from Amazon), and requires an agent to purchase a product based on a user\ninstruction (e.g. \u201cI am looking for a nightstand with drawers. It should have a nickel finish, and\npriced lower than $140\u201d) through web interactions (e.g. search \u201cnightstand drawers\u201d, choose buttons\nsuch as \u201ccolor: modern-nickel-white\u201d or \u201cback to search\u201d). This task is evaluated by average score\n(percentage of desired attributes covered by the chosen product averaged across all episodes) and\nsuccess rate (percentage of episodes where the chosen product satisfies all requirements) on 500 test\ninstructions. We formulate Act prompts with actions to search, choose product, choose options,\nand buy, with ReAct prompts additionally reasoning to determine what to explore, when to buy,\nand what products options are relevant to the instruction. See Table 6 for an example prompt, and\nTable 10 for model predictions in the Appendix. We compare to an imitation learning (IL) method\n5Micheli & Fleuret (2021) finetuned a GPT-2 model on 3553 task instances and achieved a much improved\nperformance than BUTLER, but it is trained on all task types, thus not included as a baseline.\n7\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\nMethod\nPick\nClean\nHeat\nCool\nLook\nPick 2\nAll\nAct (best of 6)\n88\n42\n74\n67\n72\n41\n45\nReAct (avg)\n65\n39\n83\n76\n55\n24\n57\nReAct (best of 6)\n92\n58\n96\n86\n78\n41\n71\nReAct-IM (avg)\n55\n59\n60\n55\n23\n24\n48\nReAct-IM (best of 6)\n62\n68\n87\n57\n39\n33\n53\nBUTLERg (best of 8)\n33\n26\n70\n76\n17\n12\n22\nBUTLER (best of 8)\n46\n39\n74\n100\n22\n24\n37\nTable 3: AlfWorld task-specific success rates (%).

On\nALFWorld, the best ReAct trial achieves an average success rate of 71%, significantly outperforming\nthe best Act (45%) and BUTLER (37%) trials. In fact, even the worse ReAct trial (48%) beats\nthe best trial of both methods. Moreover, the advantage of ReAct over Act is consistent across\nsix controlled trials, with relative performance gain ranging from 33% to 90% and averaging 62%.\nQualitatively, we saw that, without any thoughts at all, Act fails to correctly decompose goals\ninto smaller subgoals, or loses track of the current state of the environment. Example trajectories\ncomparing ReAct and Act can be found in Appendix D.2.1 and Appendix D.2.2.\nOn Webshop, one-shot Act prompting already performs on par with IL and IL+RL methods. With\nadditional sparse reasoning, ReAct achieves significantly better performance, with an absolute 10%\nimprovement over the previous best success rate. By checking examples, we find that ReAct is more\nlikely to identify instruction-relevant products and options by reasoning to bridge the gap between\nnoisy observations and actions (e.g. \u201cFor \u2018space-saving ottoman bench for living room\u2019, the item\nhas options \u201839x18x18inch\u2019 and \u2018blue\u2019 and seems good to buy.\u201d). However, existing methods are\nstill far from the performance of expert humans (Table 4), who perform significantly more product\nexplorations and query re-formulations that are still challenging for prompting-based methods.\nOn the value of internal reasoning vs. external feedback\nTo our knowledge, ReAct is the first\ndemonstration of combined reasoning and action using an LLM applied to an interactive environment\nwithin a closed-loop system. Perhaps the closest prior work is Inner Monologue (IM), from Huang\net al. (2022b), in which actions from an embodied agent are motivated by an eponymous \u201cinner\nmonologue\u201d. However, IM\u2019s \u201cinner monologue\u201d is limited to observations of the environment\nstate and what needs to be completed by the agent for the goal to be satisfied. In contrast, the\nreasoning traces in ReAct for decision making is flexible and sparse, allowing diverse reasoning\ntypes (see Section 2) to be induced for different tasks.\nTo demonstrate the differences between ReAct and IM, and to highlight the importance of internal\nreasoning vs. simple reactions to external feedback, we ran an ablation experiment using a thought\npattern composed of IM-like dense external feedback. As can be seen in Table 3, ReAct substantially\noutperforms IM-style prompting (ReAct-IM) (71 vs. 53 overall success rate), with consistent\nadvantages on five out of six tasks. Qualitatively, we observed that ReAct-IM often made mistakes\nin identifying when subgoals were finished, or what the next subgoal should be, due to a lack of highlevel goal decomposition. Additionally, many ReAct-IM trajectories struggled to determine where\nan item would likely be within the ALFWorld environment, due to a lack of commonsense reasoning.\nBoth shortcomings can be addressed in the ReAct paradigm. More details about ReAct-IM is in\nAppendix B.2. An example prompt for ReAct-IM can be found in Appendix C.4, and an example\ntrajectory in Appendix D.2.3.\n8\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\n5\nRELATED WORK\nLanguage model for reasoning\nPerhaps the most well-known work of using LLMs for reasoning\nis Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022), which reveals the ability of LLMs to formulate their\nown \u201cthinking procedure\u201d for problem solving. Several follow-up works have since been performed,\nincluding least-to-most prompting for solving complicated tasks (Zhou et al., 2022), zero-shotCoT (Kojima et al., 2022), and reasoning with self-consistency (Wang et al., 2022a). Recently,\n(Madaan & Yazdanbakhsh, 2022) systematically studied the formulation and structure of CoT, and\nobserved that the presence of symbols, patterns and texts is crucial to the effectiveness of CoT. Other\nwork has also been extended to more sophisticated reasoning architecture beyond simple prompting.\nFor example Selection-Inference (Creswell et al., 2022) divides the reasoning process into two steps\nof \u201cselection\u201d and \u201cinference\u201d. STaR (Zelikman et al., 2022) bootstraps the reasoning process by\nfinetuning the model on correct rationales generated by the model itself. Faithful reasoning (Creswell\n& Shanahan, 2022) decomposes multi-step reasoning into three steps, each performed by a dedicated\nLM respectively. Similar approaches like Scratchpad (Nye et al., 2021), which finetunes a LM on\nintermediate computation steps, also demonstrate improvement on multi-step computation problems.\nIn contrast to these methods, ReAct performs more than just isolated, fixed reasoning, and integrates\nmodel actions and their corresponding observations into a coherent stream of inputs for the model to\nreason more accurately and tackle tasks beyond reasoning (e.g. interactive decision making).\nLanguage model for decision making\nThe strong capability of LLMs has enabled them to perform\ntasks beyond language generation, and it is becoming more popular to take advantage of LLMs as a\npolicy model for decision making, especially in interactive environments. WebGPT (Nakano et al.,\n2021) uses an LM to interact with web browsers, navigate through web pages, and infer answers to\ncomplicated questions from ELI5 (Fan et al., 2019). In comparison to ReAct, WebGPT does not\nexplicitly model the thinking and reasoning procedure, instead rely on expensive human feedback for\nreinforcement learning. In conversation modeling, chatbots like BlenderBot (Shuster et al., 2022b)\nand Sparrow (Glaese et al., 2022) and task-oriented dialogue systems like SimpleTOD (Hosseini-Asl\net al., 2020) also train LMs to make decision about API calls. Unlike ReAct, they do not explicitly\nconsider the reasoning procedure either, and also relies on expensive datasets and human feedback\ncollections for policy learning. In contrast, ReAct learns a policy in a much cheaper way, since the\ndecision making process only requires language description of the reasoning procedure.6\nLLMS have also been increasingly employed in interactive and embodied environments for planning\nand decision making. Perhaps most relevant to ReAct in this respect are SayCan (Ahn et al., 2022)\nand Inner Monologue (Huang et al., 2022b), which use LLMs for robotic action planning and decision\nmaking. In SayCan, LLMs were prompted to directly predict possible actions a robot can take, which\nis then reranked by an affordance model grounded on the visual environments for final prediction.\nInner Monologue made further improvements by adding the eponymous \u201cinner monologue\", which is\nimplemented as injected feedback from the environment. To our knowledge, Inner Monologue is the\nfirst work that demonstrates such a closed-loop system, which ReAct builds on. However, we argue\nthat Inner Monologue does not truly comprise of inner thoughts \u2014 this is elaborated in Section 4. We\nalso note that leveraging language as semantically-rich inputs in the process of interactive decision\nmaking has been shown to be successful under other settings (Abramson et al., 2020; Karamcheti\net al., 2021; Huang et al., 2022a; Li et al., 2022). It is becoming more evident that with the help of\nLLMs, language as a fundamental cognitive mechanism will play a critical role in interaction and\ndecision making. What is more, progress in LLMs has also inspired the development of versatile and\ngeneralist agents like Reed et al. (2022).\n6\nCONCLUSION\nWe have proposed ReAct \u2013 a simple yet effective method for synergizing reasoning and acting in\nlarge language models. Through a diverse set of experiments on multi-hop question-answering, fact\nchecking, and interactive decision-making tasks, we show that ReAct leads to superior performance\nwith interpretable decision traces. Despite the simplicity of our method, complex tasks with large\naction spaces require more demonstrations to learn well, which unfortunately can easily go beyond\nthe input length limit of in-context learning. We explore the fine-tuning approach on HotpotQA\n6Human feedback can also be incorporated in a complementary manner but we leave it for future work.\n9\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\nwith initial promising results, but learning from more high-quality human annotations will be the\ndesiderata to further improve the performance. Scaling up ReAct with multi-task training and\ncombining it with complementary paradigms like reinforcement learning could result in stronger\nagents that further unlock the potential of LLMs for more applications.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank the support and feedback of many people from Google Brain team and Princeton NLP\nGroup.

To increase reproducibility, we have included all used prompts in Appendix C, additional\nexperiments using GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) in Appendix A.1, and associated GPT-3 ReAct\nprompting code at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ReAct-2268/.\nETHICS STATEMENT\nReAct prompts large language models to generate more human interpretable, diagnosable, and\ncontrollable task-solving trajectories than previous methods. However, hooking up a large language\nmodel with an action space to interact with external environments (e.g. the web, physical environments) has potential dangers, e.g. looking up inappropriate or private information, or taking harmful\nactions in an environment. Our experiments minimize such risks by limiting the interactions to\nspecific websites (Wikipedia or WebShop) that are free of private information, without any dangerous\nactions in the action space design (i.e. models cannot really buy products on WebShop the research\nbenchmark, or edit Wikipedia). We believe researchers should be aware of such risks before designing\nmore extensive experiments in the future.\nREFERENCES\nJosh Abramson, Arun Ahuja, Iain Barr, Arthur Brussee, Federico Carnevale, Mary Cassin, Rachita\nChhaparia, Stephen Clark, Bogdan Damoc, Andrew Dudzik, Petko Georgiev, Aurelia Guy, Tim\nHarley, Felix Hill, Alden Hung, Zachary Kenton, Jessica Landon, Timothy Lillicrap, Kory Mathewson, So\u02c7na Mokr\u00e1, Alistair Muldal, Adam Santoro, Nikolay Savinov, Vikrant Varma, Greg Wayne,\nDuncan Williams, Nathaniel Wong, Chen Yan, and Rui Zhu.

4: Another example HotpotQA question, where the original label is outdated. Only ReAct is\nable to obtain the up-to-date answer thanks to real-world web interaction plus reasoning.\nDuring trajectory inspection, we also find that sometimes ReAct does not agree with dataset labels as\nthe labels themselves could be outdated. For example, as shown in Figure 4, the question asks about\nthe size of a hotel, which increased from the HotpotQA construction time. While Standard and CoT\ngive wrong answers due to hallucination, Act fails despite the access of real-world web interaction,\ndue to a lack of reasoning to guide how to interact with the Internet for QA. Only ReAct is able to\nretrieve up-to-date information from the Internet and provide a reasonable answer. Therefore, better\nincorporation of reasoning abilities might benefit recent Internet-augmented language models (Nakano\net al., 2021; Lazaridou et al., 2022; Shuster et al., 2022a) for up-to-date task solving.\nA.3\nHUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP BEHAVIOR CORRECTION ON ALFWORLD\nWe also explore human-in-the-loop interaction with ReAct, to allow a human to inspect and edit\nReAct\u2019s reasoning traces. Figure 5 shows that by simply removing a hallucinating sentence in Act\n17 and adding some hints in Act 23, ReAct can be made to change its behavior drastically to align\nwith these human thought edits and succeed in the task. From a human perspective, solving such a\ntask becomes significantly easier, from typing tens of actions to only editing a couple of thoughts,\nwhich enables new forms of human-machine collaboration.

5: A human-in-the-loop behavior correction example with ReAct in AlfWorld. (a) ReAct\ntrajectory fails due to a hallucinating thought (Act 17). (b) By a human simply editing two thoughts\n(Act 17, 23), the ReAct trajectory produces desirable reasoning traces and actions and succeeds.\nis difficult for Act and previous RL methods, as a human cannot change the model parameters, and\nchanging a few actions might not edit the rest of the model behavior. This paradigm is also more than\nhuman dialogue to update the goal or subgoal as in Huang et al. (2022b) \u2014 while editing ReAct\nthoughts can do these, it can also modify the model\u2019s internal belief, reasoning styles, or anything the\nflexible thought space supports, for better task solving. We believe this is an exciting direction for\nhuman alignment and leave more systematic study as future work.\nB\nEXPERIMENT DETAILS\nB.1\nHOTPOTQA FINETUNING DETAILS\nFor all finetuning we use a batch size of 64. On PaLM-8B, we finetune ReAct and Act methods\nfor 4, 000 steps and Standard and CoT methods for 2, 000 steps. On PaLM-62B, we finetune\nReAct and Act methods for 4, 000 steps and Standard and CoT methods for 1, 000 steps. We\nfind ReAct and Act methods generally benefit from more training steps (and more training data),\nwhile Standard and CoT methods degrade soon after finetuning.\nB.2\nALFWORLD IM-STYLE DETAILS\nFor the IM-style ablation, the same expert trajectories used in ReAct are reannotated with dense\nexternal feedback thoughts within these trajectories, that limit ReAct-IM to only think about (1)\ndecomposing the current goal and (2) the current subgoal that needs to be completed. In particular,\nReAct-IM lacks thoughts that (1) determine when a subgoal is completed (2) determine what the\nnext subgoal should be (3) inducing the LLM to refer to its internal pretraining knowledge to identify\nwhere items can be within the environment.\n15\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\nC\nPROMPTS\nC.1\nHOTPOTQA\nHotpot QA Prompts\nOriginal\nQuestion\nWhat is the

then played a\ndetective in the short-lived Fox television series New Amsterdam (2008), and\nappeared in the 2009 Fox television film Virtuality, originally intended as\na pilot.\nThought 2\nBecause

Projet page with code: [https://react-lm.github.io/](https://react-lm.github.io/).\n\nanswers from questions in arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks (Wei et al., 2022). However, this \"chain-of-thought\" reasoning is a static black box, in that the model uses its own internal representations to generate thoughts and is not grounded in the external world, which limits its ability to reason reactively or update its knowledge. This can lead to issues like fact hallucination and error propagation over the reasoning process (Figure 1 (1b)). On the other hand, recent work has explored the use of pre-trained language models for planning and acting in interactive environments (Ahn et al., 2022; Nakano et al., 2021; Yao et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2022a), with a focus on predicting actions via language priors. These approaches usually convert multi-modal observations into text, use a language model to generate domain-specific actions or plans, and then use a controller to choose or execute them. However, they do not employ language models to reason abstractly about high-level goals or maintain a working memory to support acting, barring Huang et al. (2022b) who perform a limited form of verbal reasoning to reiterate spatial facts about the current state. Beyond such simple embodied tasks to interact with a few blocks, there have not been studies on how reasoning and acting can be combined in a synergistic manner for general task solving, and if such a combination can bring systematic benefits compared to reasoning or acting alone.\n\nIn this work, we present ReAct, a general paradigm to combine reasoning and acting with language models for solving diverse language reasoning and decision making tasks (Figure 1). ReAct prompts LLMs to generate both verbal reasoning traces and actions pertaining to a task in an interleaved manner, which allows the model to perform dynamic reasoning to create, maintain, and adjust high-level plans for acting (reason to act), while also interact with the external environments (e.g. Wikipedia) to incorporate additional information into reasoning (act to reason).\n\nFigure 1: (1) Comparison of 4 prompting methods, (a) Standard, (b) Chain-of-thought (CoT, Reason Only), (c) Act-only, and (d) ReAct (Reason+Act), solving a HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018) question. (2) Comparison of (a) Act-only and (b) ReAct prompting to solve an AlfWorld (Shridhar et al., 2020b) game. In both domains, we omit in-context examples in the prompt, and only show task solving trajectories generated by the model (Act, Thought) and the environment (Obs).\n\nWe conduct empirical evaluations of ReAct and state-of-the-art baselines on four diverse benchmarks: question answering (HotPotQA, Yang et al., 2018), fact verification (Fever, Thorne et al., 2018), text-based game (ALFWorld, Shridhar et al., 2020b), and webpage navigation (WebShop, Yao et al., 2022). For HotPotQA and Fever, with access to a Wikipedia API that the model can interact with, ReAct outperforms vanilla action generation models while being competitive with chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022). The best approach overall is a combination of ReAct and CoT that allows for the use of both internal knowledge and externally obtained information during reasoning. On ALFWorld and WebShop, two or even one-shot ReAct prompting is able to outperform imitation or reinforcement learning methods trained with \\(10^{3}\\sim 10^{5}\\) task instances, with an absolute improvement of 34% and 10% in success rates respectively. We also demonstrate the importance of sparse, versatile reasoning in decision making by showing consistent advantages over controlled baselines with actions only. Besides general applicability and performance boost, the combination of reasoning and acting also contributes to model interpretability, trustworthiness, and diagnosability across all domains, as humans can readily distinguish information from model's internal knowledge versus external environments, as well as inspect reasoning traces to understand the decision basis of model actions.\n\nTo summarize, our key contributions are the following: (1) we introduce ReAct, a novel prompt-based paradigm to synergize reasoning and acting in language models for general task solving; (2) we perform extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks to showcase the advantage of ReAct in a few-shot learning setup over prior approaches that perform either reasoning or action generation in isolation; (3) we present systematic ablations and analysis to understand the importance of acting in reasoning tasks, and reasoning in interactive tasks; (4) we analyze the limitations of ReAct under the prompting setup (i.e. limited support of reasoning and acting behaviors), and perform initial finetuning experiments showing the potential of ReAct to improve with additional training data. Scaling up ReAct to train and operate on more tasks and combining it with complementary paradigms like reinforcement learning could further unlock the potential of large language models.\n\n## 2 ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning + Acting\n\nConsider a general setup of an agent interacting with an environment for task solving. At time step \\(t\\), an agent receives an observation \\(o_{t}\\in\\mathcal{O}\\) from the environment and takes an action \\(a_{t}\\in\\mathcal{A}\\) following some policy \\(\\pi(a_{t}|c_{t})\\), where \\(c_{t}=(o_{1},a_{1},\\cdots,o_{t-1},a_{t-1},o_{t})\\) is the _context_ to the agent. Learning a policy is challenging when the mapping \\(c_{t}\\mapsto a_{t}\\) is highly implicit and requires extensive computation. For example, the agent shown in Figure 1(c) is unable to generate the correct final action (Act 4) to finish the QA task as it requires complex reasoning over the trajectory context (Question, Act 1-3, Obs 1-3). Similarly, the agent shown in Figure 1(a) fails to comprehend from the context that sinkbasin 1 does not contain peppershaker 1, thus keep producing hallucinating actions.\n\nThe idea of ReAct is simple: we augment the agent's action space to \\(\\hat{\\mathcal{A}}=\\mathcal{A}\\cup\\mathcal{L}\\), where \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) is the space of language. An action \\(\\hat{a}_{t}\\in\\mathcal{L}\\) in the language space, which we will refer to as a _thought_ or a _reasoning trace_, does not affect the external environment, thus leading to no observation feedback. Instead, a thought \\(\\hat{a}_{t}\\) aims to compose useful information by reasoning over the current context \\(c_{t}\\), and update the context \\(c_{t+1}=(c_{t},\\hat{a}_{t})\\) to support future reasoning or acting. As shown in Figure 1, there could be various types of useful thoughts, e.g. decomposing task goals and create action plans (2b, Act 1; 1d, Thought 1), injecting commonsense knowledge relevant to task solving (2b, Act 1), extracting important parts from observations (1d, Thought2, 4), track progress and transit action plans (2b, Act 8), handle exceptions and adjust action plans (1d, Thought 3), and so on.\n\nHowever, as the language space \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) is unlimited, learning in this augmented action space is difficult and requires strong language priors. In this paper, we mainly focus on the setup where a frozen large language model, PaLM-540B (Chowdhery et al., 2022)1, is prompted with few-shot in-context examples to generate both domain-specific actions and free-form language thoughts for task solving (Figure 1 (1d), (2b)). Each in-context example is a human trajectory of actions, thoughts, and environment observations to solve a task instance (see Appendix C). For the tasks where reasoning is of primary importance (Figure 1(1)), we alternate the generation of thoughts and actions so that the task-solving trajectory consists of multiple thought-action-observation steps. In contrast, for decision making tasks that potentially involve a large number of actions (Figure 1(2)), thoughts only need to appear sparsely in the most relevant positions of a trajectory, so we let the language model decide the asynchronous occurrence of thoughts and actions for itself.\n\nSince decision making and reasoning capabilities are integrated into a large language model, ReAct enjoys several unique features: **A) Intuitive and easy to design**: Designing ReAct prompts is straightforward as human annotators just type down their thoughts in language on top of their actions taken. No ad-hoc format choice, thought design, or example selection is used in this paper. We detail prompt design for each task in Sections 3 and 4. **B) General and flexible**: Due to the flexible thought space and thought-action occurrence format, ReAct works for diverse tasks with distinct action spaces and reasoning needs, including but not limited to QA, fact verification, text game, and web navigation. **C) Performant and robust**: ReAct shows strong generalization to new task instances while learning solely from one to six in-context examples, consistently outperforming baselines with only reasoning or acting across different domains. We also show in Section 3 additional benefits when finetuning is enabled, and in Section 4 how ReAct performance is robust to prompt selections. **D) Human aligned and controllable**: ReAct promises an interpretable sequential decision making and reasoning process where humans can easily inspect reasoning and factual correctness. Moreover, humans can also control or correct the agent behavior on the go by thought editing, as shown in Figure 5 in Section 4.\n\n## 3 Knowledge-Intensive Reasoning Tasks\n\nWe begin with knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks like multi-hop question answering and fact verification. As shown in Figure 1(1d), by interacting with a Wikipedia API, ReAct is able to retrieve information to support reasoning, while also use reasoning to target what to retrieve next, demonstrating a synergy of reasoning and acting.\n\n### Setup\n\nDomainsWe consider two datasets challenging knowledge retrieval and reasoning: (1) HotPotQA (Yang et al., 2018), a multi-hop question answering benchmark that requires reasoning over two or more Wikipedia passages, and (2) FEVER (Thorne et al., 2018), a fact verification benchmark where each claim is annotated SUPPORTS, REFUTES, or NOT ENOUGH INFO, based on if there exists a Wikipedia passage to verify the claim. In this work, we operate in a question-only setup for both tasks, where models only receive the question/claim as input without access to support paragraphs, and have to rely on their internal knowledge or retrieve knowledge via interacting with an external environment to support reasoning.\n\nAction SpaceWe design a simple Wikipedia web API with three types of actions to support interactive information retrieval: (1) **search**[entity], which returns the first 5 sentences from the corresponding entity wiki page if it exists, or else suggests top-5 similar entities from the Wikipedia search engine, (2) **lookup**[string], which would return the next sentence in the page containing string, simulating Ctrl+F functionality on the browser. (3) **finish**[answer], which would finish the current task with answer. We note that this action space mostly can only retrieve a small part of a passage based on exact passage name, which is significantly weaker than state-of-the-art lexical or neural retrievers. The purpose is to simulate how humans would interact with Wikipedia, and force models to retrieve via explicit reasoning in language.\n\n### Methods\n\nReAct PromptingFor HotpotQA and Fever, we randomly select 6 and 3 cases2 from the training set and manually compose ReAct-format trajectories to use as few-shot exemplars in the prompts. Similar to Figure 1(d), each trajectory consists of multiple thought-action-observation steps (i.e. dense thought), where free-form thoughts are used for various purposes. Specifically, we use a combination of thoughts that decompose questions (\"I need to search x, find y, then find z\"), extract information from Wikipedia observations (\"x was started in 1844\", \"The paragraph does not tell x\"), perform commonsense (\"x is not y, so z must instead be...\") or arithmetic reasoning (\"1844 < 1989\"), guide search reformulation (\"maybe I can search/look up x instead\"), and synthesize the final answer (\"...so the answer is x\"). See Appendix C for more details.\n\nBaselinesWe systematically ablate ReAct trajectories to build prompts for multiple baselines (with formats as Figure 1(a-1c)): (a) **Standard prompting** (Standard), which removes all thoughts, actions, observations in ReAct trajectories. (b) **Chain-of-thought prompting** (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022), which removes actions and observations and serve as a reasoning-only baseline. We also build a self-consistency baseline (CoT-SC) (Wang et al., 2022;b) by sampling 21 CoT trajectories with decoding temperature 0.7 during inference and adopting the majority answer, which is found to consistently boost performance over CoT. (c) **Acting-only prompt** (Act), which removes thoughts in ReAct trajectories, loosely resembling how WebGPT (Nakano et al., 2021) interacts with the Internet to answer questions, though it operates on a different task and action space, and uses imitation and reinforcement learning instead of prompting.\n\nCombining Internal and External KnowledgeAs will be detail in Section 3.3, we observe that the problem solving process demonstrated by ReAct is more factual and grounded, whereas CoT is more accurate in formulating reasoning structure but can easily suffer from hallucinated facts or thoughts. We therefore propose to incorporate ReAct and CoT-SC, and let the model decide when to switch to the other method based on the following heuristics: A) **ReAct**\\(\\rightarrow\\)**CoT-SC**: when ReAct fails to return an answer within given steps, back off to CoT-SC. We set 7 and 5 steps for HotpotQA and FEVER respectively as we find more steps will not improve ReAct performance3.\n\nFootnote 3: Of all trajectories with correct final answers, those with 7 steps on HotpotQA and 5 steps on FEVER only take up 0.84% and 1.33% respectively.\n\nB) **CoT-SC**\\(\\rightarrow\\)**ReAct**: when the majority answer among \\(n\\) CoT-SC samples occurs less than \\(n/2\\) times (i.e. internal knowledge might not support the task confidently), back off to ReAct.\n\nFinetuningDue to the challenge of manually annotating reasoning traces and actions at scale, we consider a bootstraping approach similar to Zelikman et al. (2022), using 3,000 trajectories with correct answers generated by ReAct (also for other baselines) to finetune smaller language models (PaLM-8/62B) to decode trajectories (all thoughts, actions, observations) conditioned on input questions/claims. More details are in Appendix B.1.\n\n### Results and Observations\n\nReAct outperforms Act consistentlyTable 1 shows HotpotQA and Fever results using PaLM-540B as the base model with different prompting methods. We note that ReAct is better than Act on both tasks, demonstrating the value of reasoning to guide acting, especially for synthesizing the final answer, as shown in Figure 1 (c-d). Fine-tuning results 3 also confirm the benefit of reasoning traces for more informed acting.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l|c|c} \\hline \\hline\n**Prompt Methoda** & **HotpotQA** (EM) & **Fever** (Acc) \\\\ \\hline Standard & 28.7 & 57.1 \\\\ CoT(Wei et al., 2022) & 29.4 & 56.3 \\\\ CoT-SC (Wang et al., 2022) & 33.4 & 60.4 \\\\ \\hline Act & 32.7 & 58.9 \\\\ ReAct & 27.4 & 60.9 \\\\ CoT-SC\\(\\rightarrow\\) ReAct & 34.2 & **64.6** \\\\ ReAct\\(\\rightarrow\\) CoT-SC & **35.1** & 62.0 \\\\ \\hline \\hline\n**Supervised SoTAb** & 67.5 & 89.5 \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: PaLM-540B prompting results on HotpotQA and Fever.\n\n**ReAct vs. CoT** On the other hand, ReAct outperforms CoT on Fever (60.9 vs. 56.3) and slightly lags behind CoT on HotpotQA (27.4 vs. 29.4). Fever claims for SUPPORTS/REFUTES might only differ by a slight amount (see Appendix D.1), so acting to retrieve accurate and up-to-date knowledge is vital. To better understand the behavioral difference between ReAct and CoT on HotpotQA, we randomly sampled 50 trajectories with correct and incorrect answers (judged by EM) from ReAct and CoT respectively (thus 200 examples in total), and manually labeled their success and failure modes in Table 2. Some key observations are as follows:\n\nA) **Hallucination is a serious problem for CoT**, resulting in much higher false positive rate than ReAct (14% vs. 6%) in success mode, and make up its major failure mode (56%). In contrast, the problem solving trajectory of ReActis more grounded, fact-driven, and trustworthy, thanks to the access of an external knowledge base.\n\nB) **While interleaving reasoning, action and observation steps improves ReAct's groundedness and trustworthiness, such a structural constraint also reduces its flexibility in formulating reasoning steps**, leading to more reasoning error rate than CoT. we note that there is one frequent error pattern specific to ReAct, in which the model repetitively generates the previous thoughts and actions, and we categorize it as part of \"reasoning error\" as the model fails to reason about what the proper next action to take and jump out of the loop4.\n\nFootnote 4: We suspect that this could be due to the sub-optimal greedy decoding procedure, and future work using better decoding (e.g. beam search) might help address this issue.\n\n**C) For ReAct, successfully retrieving informative knowledge via search is critical.** Non-informative search, which counts for 23% of the error cases, derails the model reasoning and gives it a hard time to recover and reformulate thoughts. This is perhaps an expected trade-off between factuality and flexibility, which motivates our proposed strategies of combining two methods.\n\nWe provide examples for each success and failure modes in Appendix E.1. We also find some HotpotQA questions may contain outdated answer labels, see Figure 4 for example.\n\n**ReAct + CoT-SC perform best for prompting LLMs** Also shown in Table 1, the best prompting method on HotpotQA and Fever are ReAct \\(\\rightarrow\\) CoT-SC and CoT-SC \\(\\rightarrow\\) ReAct respectively. Furthermore, Figure 2 shows how different methods perform with respect to the number of CoT-SC samples used. While two ReAct + CoT-SC methods are advantageous at one task each, they both significantly and consistently outperform CoT-SC across different number of samples, reaching CoT-SC performance with 21 samples using merely 3-5 samples. These results indicate the value of properly combining model internal knowledge and external knowledge for reasoning tasks.\n\n**ReAct performs best for fine-tuning** Figure 3 shows the scaling effect of prompting/finetuning four methods (Standard, CoT, Act, ReAct) on HotpotQA. With PaLM-8/62B, prompting ReAct performs worst among four methods due to the difficulty to learn both reasoning and acting from in-context examples. However, when finetuned with just 3,000 examples, ReAct becomes the best method among the four, with PaLM-8B finetuned ReAct outperforming all PaLM-62B prompting methods, and PaLM-62B finetuned ReAct outperforming all 540B prompting methods. In contrast, finetuning Standard or CoT is significantly worse than finetuning ReAct or Act for both PaLM-8/62B, as the former essentially teaches models to memorize (potentially hallucinated) knowledge facts, and the latter teaches models how to (reason and) act to access information from Wikipedia, a more generalizable skill for knowledge reasoning. As all prompting methods are still significantly far from domain-specific state-of-the-art approaches (Table 1), we believe finetuning with more human-written data might be a better way to unleash the power of ReAct.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c|c l c c} \\hline \\hline  & Type & Definition & ReAct & CoT \\\\ \\hline \\multirow{2}{*}{Success} & Tree positive & Correct reasoning trace and facts & 94\\% & 86\\% \\\\  & False positive & Hallucinated reasoning trace or facts & 6\\% & 14\\% \\\\ \\hline \\multirow{4}{*}{Failure} & Reasoning error & Wrong reasoning trace (including failing to recover from repetitive steps) & 47\\% & 16\\% \\\\  & Search result error & Search return empty or does not contain useful information & 23\\% & - \\\\ \\cline{1-1}  & Hallucinated reasoning trace or facts & 0\\% & 56\\% \\\\ \\cline{1-1}  & Label ambiguity & Right prediction but did not match the label precisely & 29\\% & 28\\% \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 2: Types of success and failure modes of ReAct and CoT on HotpotQA, as well as their percentages in randomly selected examples studied by human.\n\n## 4 Decision Making Tasks\n\nWe also test ReAct on two language-based interactive decision-making tasks, ALFWorld and WebShop, both of which feature complex environments that require agents to act over long horizons with sparse rewards, warranting the need for reasoning to act and explore effectively.\n\nALFWorldALFWorld (Shridhar et al., 2020b) (Figure 1(2)) is a synthetic text-based game designed to align with the embodied ALFRED benchmark (Shridhar et al., 2020a). It includes 6 types of tasks in which an agent needs to achieve a high-level goal (e.g. examine paper under desklamp) by navigating and interacting with a simulated household via text actions (e.g. go to coffetable 1, take paper 2, use desklamp 1). A task instance can have more than 50 locations and take an expert policy more than 50 steps to solve, thus challenging an agent to plan and track subgoals, as well as explore systematically (e.g. check all desks one by one for desklamp). In particular, one challenge built into ALFWorld is the need to determine likely locations for common household items (e.g. desklamps will likely be on desks, shelfs, or dressers), making this environment a good fit for LLMs to exploit their pretrained commonsense knowledge. To prompt ReAct, we randomly annotate three trajectories from the training set for each task type, where each trajectory includes sparse thoughts that (1) decompose the goal, (2) track subgoal completion, (3) determine the next subgoal, and (4) reason via commonsense where to find an object and what to do with it. We show prompts used for ALFWorld in Appendix C.4. Following Shridhar et al. (2020b), we evaluate on 134 unseen evaluation games in a task-specific setup. For robustness, we construct 6 prompts for each task type through each permutation of 2 annotated trajectories from the 3 we annotate. Act prompts are constructed using the same trajectories, but without thoughts -- since task instances are randomly chosen from the training set, it favors neither ReAct nor Act and provides a fair and controlled comparison to test the importance of sparse thoughts. For baselines, we use BUTLER (Shridhar et al., 2020b), an imitation learning agent trained on \\(10^{5}\\) expert trajectories for each task type5.\n\nFootnote 5: Micheli & Fleuret (2021) finetuned a GPT-2 model on 3553 task instances and achieved a much improved performance than BUTLER, but it is trained on all task types, thus not included as a baseline.\n\nWebShopCan ReAct also interact with noisy real-world language environments for practical applications? We investigate WebShop (Yao et al., 2022), a recently proposed online shopping website environment with 1.18M real-world products and 12k human instructions. Unlike ALFWorld, Webshop contains a high variety of structured and unstructured texts (e.g. product titles, descriptions, and options crawled from Amazon), and requires an agent to purchase a product based on a user instruction (e.g. \"I am looking for a nightstand with drawers. It should have a nickel finish, and priced lower than S140\") through web interactions (e.g. search \"nightstand drawers\", choose buttons such as \"color: modern-nickel-white\" or \"back to search\"). This task is evaluated by average score (percentage of desired attributes covered by the chosen product averaged across all episodes) and success rate (percentage of episodes where the chosen product satisfies all requirements) on 500 test instructions. We formulate Act prompts with actions to search, choose product, choose options, and buy, with ReAct prompts additionally reasoning to determine what to explore, when to buy, and what products options are relevant to the instruction. See Table 6 for an example prompt, and Table 10 for model predictions in the Appendix. We compare to an imitation learning (IL) method\n\nFigure 3: Scaling results for prompting and finetuning on HotPotQA with ReAct (ours) and baselines.\n\ntrained with 1,012 human annotated trajectories, and a imitation + reinforcement learning (IL + RL) method additionally trained with 10,587 training instructions.\n\nResultsReAct outperforms Act on both ALFWorld (Table 3) and Webshop (Table 4). On ALFWorld, the best ReAct trial achieves an average success rate of 71%, significantly outperforming the best Act (45%) and BUTLER (37%) trials. In fact, even the worse ReAct trial (48%) beats the best trial of both methods. Moreover, the advantage of ReAct over Act is consistent across six controlled trials, with relative performance gain ranging from 33% to 90% and averaging 62%. Qualitatively, we saw that, without any thoughts at all, Act fails to correctly decompose goals into smaller subgoals, or loses track of the current state of the environment. Example trajectories comparing ReAct and Act can be found in Appendix D.2.1 and Appendix D.2.2.\n\nOn Webshop, one-shot Act prompting already performs on par with IL and IL+RL methods. With additional sparse reasoning, ReAct achieves significantly better performance, with an absolute 10% improvement over the previous best success rate. By checking examples, we find that ReAct is more likely to identify instruction-relevant products and options by reasoning to bridge the gap between noisy observations and actions (e.g. \"For'space-saving optoman bench for living room', the item has options '39x18x18inch' and 'blue' and seems good to buy.\"). However, existing methods are still far from the performance of expert humans (Table 4), who perform significantly more product explorations and query re-formulations that are still challenging for prompting-based methods.\n\nOn the value of internal reasoning vs. external feedbackTo our knowledge, ReAct is the first demonstration of combined reasoning and action using an LLM applied to an interactive environment within a closed-loop system. Perhaps the closest prior work is Inner Monologue (IM), from Huang et al. (2022b), in which actions from an embodied agent are motivated by an eponymous \"inner monologue\". **However, IM's \"inner monologue\" is limited to observations of the environment state and what needs to be completed by the agent for the goal to be satisfied.** In contrast, the reasoning traces in ReAct for decision making is flexible and sparse, allowing diverse reasoning types (see Section 2) to be induced for different tasks.\n\nTo demonstrate the differences between ReAct and IM, and to highlight the importance of internal reasoning vs. simple reactions to external feedback, we ran an ablation experiment using a thought pattern composed of IM-like dense external feedback. As can be seen in Table 3, ReAct substantially outperforms IM-style prompting (ReAct-IM) (71 vs. 53 overall success rate), with consistent advantages on five out of six tasks. Qualitatively, we observed that ReAct-IM often made mistakes in identifying when subgoals were finished, or what the next subgoal should be, due to a lack of high-level goal decomposition. Additionally, many ReAct-IM trajectories struggled to determine where an item would likely be within the ALFWorld environment, due to a lack of commonsense reasoning. Both shortcomings can be addressed in the ReAct paradigm. More details about ReAct-IM is in Appendix B.2. An example prompt for ReAct-IM can be found in Appendix C.4, and an example trajectory in Appendix D.2.3.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l|c c c c c|c} \\hline \\hline Method & Pick & Clean & Heat & Cool & Look & Pick 2 & All \\\\ \\hline Act (best of 6) & 88 & 42 & 74 & 67 & 72 & **41** & 45 \\\\ ReAct (sup) & 65 & 39 & 83 & 76 & 55 & 24 & 57 \\\\ ReAct (best of 6) & **92** & 58 & **96** & 86 & **78** & **41** & **71** \\\\ \\hline ReAct-IM (sup) & 55 & 59 & 60 & 55 & 23 & 24 & 48 \\\\ ReAct-IM (best of 6) & 62 & **68** & 87 & 57 & 39 & 33 & 53 \\\\ \\hline BUTLER\\({}_{g}\\) (best of 6) & 33 & 26 & 70 & 76 & 17 & 12 & 22 \\\\ BUTLER (best of 6) & 46 & 39 & 74 & **100** & 22 & 24 & 37 \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 3: Alfv\u00e9nfold task-specific success rates (%). BUTLER and BUTLER\\({}_{g}\\) results are from Table 4 of Shridhar et al. (2020b). All methods use greedy decoding, except that BUTLER uses beam search.\n\n## 5 Related Work\n\nLanguage model for reasoningPerhaps the most well-known work of using LLMs for reasoning is Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022), which reveals the ability of LLMs to formulate their own \"thinking procedure\" for problem solving. Several follow-up works have since been performed, including least-to-most prompting for solving complicated tasks (Zhou et al., 2022), zero-shot-CoT (Kojima et al., 2022), and reasoning with self-consistency (Wang et al., 2022). Recently, (Madaan & Yazdanbakhsh, 2022) systematically studied the formulation and structure of CoT, and observed that the presence of symbols, patterns and texts is crucial to the effectiveness of CoT. Other work has also been extended to more sophisticated reasoning architecture beyond simple prompting. For example Selection-Inference (Cresswell et al., 2022) divides the reasoning process into two steps of \"selection\" and \"inference\". STaR (Zelikman et al., 2022) bootstraps the reasoning process by finetuning the model on correct rationales generated by the model itself. Faithful reasoning (Creswell & Shanahan, 2022) decomposes multi-step reasoning into three steps, each performed by a dedicated LM respectively. Similar approaches like Scratchpad (Nye et al., 2021), which finetunes a LM on intermediate computation steps, also demonstrate improvement on multi-step computation problems. In contrast to these methods, ReAct performs more than just isolated, fixed reasoning, and integrates model actions and their corresponding observations into a coherent stream of inputs for the model to reason more accurately and tackle tasks beyond reasoning (e.g. interactive decision making).\n\nLanguage model for decision makingThe strong capability of LLMs has enabled them to perform tasks beyond language generation, and it is becoming more popular to take advantage of LLMs as a policy model for decision making, especially in interactive environments. WebGPT (Nakano et al., 2021) uses an LM to interact with web browsers, navigate through web pages, and infer answers to complicated questions from ELI5 (Fan et al., 2019). In comparison to ReAct, WebGPT does not explicitly model the thinking and reasoning procedure, instead rely on expensive human feedback for reinforcement learning. In conversation modeling, chatbots like BlenderBot (Shuster et al., 2022) and Sparrow (Glaese et al., 2022) and task-oriented dialogue systems like SimpleTOD (Hosseini-Asl et al., 2020) also train LMs to make decision about API calls. Unlike ReAct, they do not explicitly consider the reasoning procedure either, and also relies on expensive datasets and human feedback collections for policy learning. In contrast, ReAct learns a policy in a much cheaper way, since the decision making process only requires language description of the reasoning procedure.6\n\nFootnote 6: Human feedback can also be incorporated in a complementary manner but we leave it for future work.\n\nLLMS have also been increasingly employed in interactive and embodied environments for planning and decision making. Perhaps most relevant to ReAct in this respect are SayCan (Ahn et al., 2022) and Inner Monologue (Huang et al., 2022), which use LLMs for robotic action planning and decision making. In SayCan, LLMs were prompted to directly predict possible actions a robot can take, which is then reranked by an affordance model grounded on the visual environments for final prediction. Inner Monologue made further improvements by adding the eponymous \"inner monologue\", which is implemented as injected feedback from the environment. To our knowledge, Inner Monologue is the first work that demonstrates such a closed-loop system, which ReAct builds on. However, we argue that Inner Monologue does not truly comprise of inner thoughts -- this is elaborated in Section 4. We also note that leveraging language as semantically-rich inputs in the process of interactive decision making has been shown to be successful under other settings (Abramson et al., 2020; Karamcheti et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2022; Li et al., 2022). It is becoming more evident that with the help of LLMs, language as a fundamental cognitive mechanism will play a critical role in interaction and decision making. What is more, progress in LLMs has also inspired the development of versatile and generalist agents like Reed et al. (2022).\n\n## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have proposed ReAct - a simple yet effective method for synergizing reasoning and acting in large language models. Through a diverse set of experiments on multi-hop question-answering, fact checking, and interactive decision-making tasks, we show that ReAct leads to superior performance with interpretable decision traces. Despite the simplicity of our method, complex tasks with large action spaces require more demonstrations to learn well, which unfortunately can easily go beyond the input length limit of in-context learning. We explore the fine-tuning approach on HotpotQAwith initial promising results, but learning from more high-quality human annotations will be the desiderata to further improve the performance. Scaling up ReAct with multi-task training and combining it with complementary paradigms like reinforcement learning could result in stronger agents that further unlock the potential of LLMs for more applications.\n\n#### Acknowledgments\n\nWe thank the support and feedback of many people from Google Brain team and Princeton NLP Group.

To increase reproducibility, we have included all used prompts in Appendix C, additional experiments using GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) in Appendix A.1, and associated GPT-3 ReAct prompting code at [https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ReAct-2268/](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ReAct-2268/).\n\n#### Ethics Statement\n\nReAct prompts large language models to generate more human interpretable, diagnosable, and controllable task-solving trajectories than previous methods. However, hooking up a large language model with an action space to interact with external environments (e.g. the web, physical environments) has potential dangers, e.g. looking up inappropriate or private information, or taking harmful actions in an environment. Our experiments minimize such risks by limiting the interactions to specific websites (Wikipedia or WebShop) that are free of private information, without any dangerous actions in the action space design (i.e. models cannot really buy products on WebShop the research benchmark, or edit Wikipedia). We believe researchers should be aware of such risks before designing more extensive experiments in the future.\n\n## References\n\n* Abramson et al.

As shown in Table 5, GPT-3 (text-davinci-002, greedy decoding) consistently outperforms PaLM-540B on HotpotQA and ALFWorld, possibly because it is finetuned with human instruction following. This indicates ReAct prompting is effective across different large language models on different tasks. The code for these experiments are at [https://react-lm.github.io/](https://react-lm.github.io/).\n\n### ReAct obtains up-to-date knowledge on HotpotQA\n\nWe also explore human-in-the-loop behavior correction on AlfWorld\n\nWe also explore human-in-the-loop interaction with ReAct, to allow a human to inspect and edit ReAct's reasoning traces. Figure 5 shows that by simply removing a hallucinating sentence in Act 17 and adding some hints in Act 23, ReAct can be made to change its behavior drastically to align with these human thought edits and succeed in the task. From a human perspective, solving such a task becomes significantly easier, from typing tens of actions to only editing a couple of thoughts, which enables new forms of human-machine collaboration. We note that such a policy edit on-the-go\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c|c c} \\hline \\hline  & PaLM-540B & GPT-3 \\\\ \\hline HotpotQA (exact match) & 29.4 & **30.8** \\\\ ALFWorld (success rate \\%) & 70.9 & **78.4** \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 5: ReAct prompting results using PaLM-540B vs. GPT-3 (text-davinci-002, greedy decoding). On HotpotQA, we randomly sample a subset of 500 validation questions. On ALFWorld, we use all 134 unseen validation task instances, and use the best prompt set according to PaLM-540B.\n\nFigure 4: Another example HotpotQA question, where the original label is outdated. Only ReAct is able to obtain the up-to-date answer thanks to real-world web interaction plus reasoning.\n\nDuring trajectory inspection, we also find that sometimes ReAct does not agree with dataset labels as the labels themselves could be outdated. For example, as shown in Figure 4, the question asks about the size of a hotel, which increased from the HotpotQA construction time. While Standard and CoT give wrong answers due to hallucination, Act fails despite the access of real-world web interaction, due to a lack of reasoning to guide how to interact with the Internet for QA. Only ReAct is able to retrieve up-to-date information from the Internet and provide a reasonable answer. Therefore, better incorporation of reasoning abilities might benefit recent Internet-augmented language models (Nakano et al., 2021; Lazaridou et al., 2022; Shuster et al., 2022a) for up-to-date task solving.\n\nis difficult for Act and previous RL methods, as a human cannot change the model parameters, and changing a few actions might not edit the rest of the model behavior. This paradigm is also more than human dialogue to update the goal or subgoal as in Huang et al. (2022b) -- while editing ReAct thoughts can do these, it can also modify the model's internal belief, reasoning styles, or anything the flexible thought space supports, for better task solving. We believe this is an exciting direction for human alignment and leave more systematic study as future work.\n\n## Appendix B Experiment Details\n\n### HotpotQA Finetuning Details\n\nFor all finetuning we use a batch size of 64. On PaLM-8B, we finetune ReAct and Act methods for \\(4,000\\) steps and Standard and CoT methods for \\(2,000\\) steps. On PaLM-62B, we finetune ReAct and Act methods for \\(4,000\\) steps and Standard and CoT methods for \\(1,000\\) steps. We find ReAct and Act methods generally benefit from more training steps (and more training data), while Standard and CoT methods degrade soon after finetuning.\n\n### AlfWorld IM-Style Details\n\nFor the IM-style ablation, the same expert trajectories used in ReAct are reannotated with dense external feedback thoughts within these trajectories, that limit ReAct-IM to only think about (1) decomposing the current goal and (2) the current subgoal that needs to be completed. In particular, ReAct-IM lacks thoughts that (1) determine when a subgoal is completed (2) determine what the next subgoal should be (3) inducing the LLM to refer to its internal pretraining knowledge to identify where items can be within the environment.\n\nFigure 5: A human-in-the-loop behavior correction example with ReAct in AlfWorld. (a) ReAct trajectory fails due to a hallucinating thought (Act 17). (b) By a human simply editing two thoughts (Act 17, 23), the ReAct trajectory produces desirable reasoning traces and actions and succeeds.\n\n## Appendix C Prompts\n\n### HotpotQA\n\n```\n1ElementQuestionWhat is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?

In an effort to get\nthe best of both worlds, this paper introduces LLM+P, the\nfirst framework that incorporates the strengths of classical\nplanners into LLMs. LLM+P takes in a natural language\ndescription of a planning problem, then returns a correct (or\noptimal) plan for solving that problem in natural language.\nLLM+P does so by first converting the language description\ninto a file written in the planning domain definition language\n(PDDL), then leveraging classical planners to quickly find a\nsolution, and then translating the found solution back into\nnatural language. Along with LLM+P, we define a diverse set\nof different benchmark problems taken from robot planning\nscenarios. Via a comprehensive set of experiments on these\nbenchmark problems, we find that LLM+P is able to provide\noptimal solutions for most problems, while LLMs fail to provide\neven feasible plans for most problems. We also show LLM+P\nenables a home robot to solve a complex manipulation task that\nis specified by the user in natural language. 1\nI. INTRODUCTION\nEver since the birth of the field, AI researchers have sought\nto create programs that can converse in natural language\nwith the same grace and flexibility as people. While even\nrelatively simple models, such as Eliza from 1966 [1], can\ngenerate responses to some prompts that seem reasonable,\nit has always been relatively easy to generate prompts that\nexpose their weaknesses compared to people \u2014 their lack of\ntrue \u201cunderstanding.\u201d\nWhile large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 [2]\nand ChatGPT [3] have far surpassed expectations of just a\nfew years ago, they are no different in this respect. Indeed\nthe internet is now awash with examples of people reveling\nin getting ChatGPT to generate output that even a 5-year-old\nhuman child would know to be ill-advised.\nGiven how LLMs are designed and trained, this phenomenon should come as no surprise. They are not specifically built to demonstrate understanding. They are trained\n*Equal contribution.\n\u2020Department\nof\nComputer\nScience,\nThe\nUniversity\nof\nTexas\nat\nAustin {bliu, lqiang, joydeep, pstone}@cs.utexas.edu,\njiangyuqian@utexas.edu\n\u2021Department of Computer Science, State University of New York at\nBinghamton {xzhan244,zhangs}@binghamton.edu\n\u00a7Sony AI\n1The code and results are publicly available at https://github.\ncom/Cranial-XIX/llm-pddl.git.\nto generate sequences of words that might be plausible to a\nhuman given a prior context. In the terms of Mahowald et\nal. [4] LLMs have become amazingly proficient at linguistic\ncompetence \u2014 knowing how to say things; but they are not\nnearly as good at functional competence \u2014 knowing what to\nsay. Specifically, they can be (relatively) easily fooled by, for\nexample, asking for the result of a straightforward arithmetic\nproblem that does not appear in their training corpus or by\nasking for the solution to a novel planning problem that\nrequires knowledge about how the world works.\nA Failure Example of GPT-4 in Planning\nProblem (P1): You have 5 blocks. One cannot place\nmore than one block on another block. b5 is on top\nof b3. b4 is on top of b2. b2 is on top of b1. b3 is on\ntop of b4. b1 is on the table. b5 is clear. Your arm\nis empty.\nYour goal is to move the blocks.\nb1 should be on top of b2.\nb3 should be on top of b5.\nb4 should be on top of b1.\nGPT-4:\n1. Move b5 from b3 to the table.\n2. Move b3 from b4 to b5.\n3. Move b4 from b2 to the table.\n4. Move b2 from b1 to b5.\n5. Move b1 from the table to b2.\n6. Move b4 from the table to b1.\nDoes that mean that we should increase efforts to include\nall arithmetic and planning problems in their training corpus?\nClearly, that is a fool\u2019s errand. On the other hand, why should\nit be necessary? We already have calculators and generalpurpose symbolic planners that are guaranteed to produce\ncorrect answers. Thus a natural alternative approach, and one\nthat we are admittedly not the first to explore, is to connect\nLLMs to such tools.\nWith this motivation in mind, the objective of the research\nreported in this paper is, for the first time, to enable LLMs to\nsolve planning problems correctly. We aim to do so without\naltering the LLMs themselves, even with finetuning [5],\n[6]. Rather, we introduce a methodology, called LLM+P\nby which, when posed a natural language description of a\nplanning problem, the LLM:\n1) outputs a problem description suitable as input to a\narXiv:2304.11477v3  [cs.AI]  27 Sep 2023\n\fLLM\nPlan\nLLM\nProblem PDDL\nPlanner\nPDDL Plan\nLLM\nPlan\nGenerated Text\nModule\nProvided Text\nProblem (P)\nLLM-As-Planner\nLLM + P (In-context Learning)\nProblem (P)\nDomain\nLLM\nPlan\nEx.

While demonstrated\nin this paper on planning problems, this general methodology\ncan be applied to any class of problems for which we have a\nsound and complete solver, such as arithmetic problems (by\nleveraging calculators).\nLimitation: In this paper, we do not ask the LLM to\nrecognize that it has been posed a prompt that is suitable for\nprocessing using the proposed LLM+P pipeline. A valuable\nfuture research direction will be to consider recognizing\nwhen a prompt should be processed by LLM+P.\nII. BACKGROUND\nThis section introduces the notation we use for representing a planning problem to be solved by LLMs, and recaps\nthe standard representation of classical planners.\nA. The Classical Planning Problem\nFormally, the input of a planning problem P is defined by\na tuple \u27e8S ,sinit,S G,A , f\u27e9:\n\u2022 S is a finite and discrete set of states used to describe\nthe world\u2019s state (i.e., state space). We assume a factored\nstate space such that each state s \u2208 S is defined by the\nvalues of a fixed set of variables.\n\u2022 sinit \u2208 S is an initial world state.\n\u2022 S G \u2282 S is a set of goal states. S G are usually\nspecified as a list of goal conditions, all of which must\nhold in a goal state.\n\u2022 A is a set of symbolic actions.\n\u2022 f is the underlying state transition function. f takes\nthe current state and an action as input and outputs the\ncorresponding next state.\nA solution to a planning problem P is a symbolic plan \u03c0 in\nthe form of \u27e8a1,a2,...,aN\u27e9, such that the preconditions of\na1 hold in sinit, the preconditions of a2 hold in the state that\nresults from applying a1, and so on, with the goal conditions\nall holding in the state that results after applying aN.\nB. Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL)\nThe planning domain definition language (PDDL) serves\nas a standardized encoding of classical planning problems [7], [8]. The PDDL representation of a planning problem P is separated into two files: a domain file and a problem\nfile. The domain PDDL file provides a lifted representation\nof the underlying rules of the world. It includes a set of\npredicates that define the state space S and the actions (i.e.,\nA ) with their preconditions and effects (i.e., the transition\nfunction f). The problem PDDL file provides a list of objects\nto ground the domain, the problem\u2019s initial state sinit and\ngoal conditions S G. There exists a rich set of symbolic\nplanners that implement efficient search algorithms to solve\nplanning problems formalized in PDDL. In this work, we aim\nto take a natural language prompt which describes the initial\nstate sinit and goal conditions S G, formulate it in PDDL,\n\fand leverage symbolic planners to output correct plans. We\nassume the domain rules are available (See the assumptions\nin Section III).\nIII. METHOD\nThis section first uses a running example to investigate\nways for formulating planning prompts in PDDL and then\nintroduces the LLM+P method.\nA. Large Language Model as a PDDL Writer\nLLMs are bad at planning (or long-horizon reasoning)\n[9] but they are good at describing and translating textual\ninputs, including re-writing planning prompts in the PDDL\nformat. The intuition is that we can view PDDL as a different\nlanguage than English, so re-writing planning prompts in\nPDDL is essentially a \u201cmachine translation\u201d task that LLMs\nare known to excel at. Here we provide an example of a\nPDDL problem file written by GPT-4 without any promptengineering. As we see, the generated file appears to have the\ncorrect PDDL syntax but uses a made-up predicate (empty)\nand misses the initial condition that b1 is on the table.\nAn Example PDDL Problem File Written by GPT-4\nPrompt: Description of Problem (P1) + Provide\nme with the problem PDDL file that describes\nthe\nplanning\nproblem\ndirectly\nwithout\nfurther\nexplanations.\nGPT-4 (the generated problem PDDL):\n(:objects b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 - block)\n(:init (on b5 b3) (on b4 b2) (on b2\nb1) (on b3 b4) (clear b5) (empty))\n(:goal (and (on b1 b2) (on b3 b5)\n(on b4 b1)))\nB. In-Context Learning\nLLMs are known to be capable of in-context learning\nwithout finetuning their parameters. By in-context learning,\nwe mean LLMs\u2019 ability to perform unseen downstream\ntasks by simply conditioning on a few input-label pairs\n(demonstrations) [10]. Here is a pair of problem descriptions\nin natural language and in PDDL provided to GPT-4 as\ncontext. When the context is included with the prompt from\nthe example above, the resulting PDDL problem file is\ndirectly solvable by the planner.\nAn Example PDDL Problem File Written by GPT-4\nwith Context\nContext (shaded):\nAn example planning problem is: You have 5 blocks.\nb2 is on top of b5. b5 is on top of b1. b1 is on top of\nb4. b3 is on top of b2. b4 is on the table. b3 is clear.\nYour arm is empty. Your goal is to move the blocks.\nb4 should be on top of b3. The problem PDDL is:\n(:objects b1 b2 b3 b4 b5)\n(:init (arm-empty) (on b1 b4) (on\nb2 b5) (on b3 b2)\n(on-table b4) (on b5 b1)\n(clear b3))\n(:goal (and (on b4 b3))))\nPrompt: Description of Problem (P1) + Context\n+ Provide me with the problem PDDL file that\ndescribes the planning problem directly without\nfurther explanations.\nGPT-4 (the generated problem PDDL):\n(:objects b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 )\n(:init (arm-empty) (on-table b1)\n(on b2 b1) (on b3 b4)\n(on b4 b2) (on b5 b3) (clear\nb5)))\n(:goal (and (on b1 b2) (on b3 b5)\n(on b4 b1)))\nPlanner:\n(unstack b5 b3) (putdown b5)\n(unstack b3 b4) (stack b3 b5)\n(unstack b4 b2) (putdown b4)\n(unstack b2 b1) (putdown b2)\n(pickup b1) (stack b1 b2) (pickup\nb4) (stack b4 b1)\nC. Large Language Model + Classical Planner (LLM+P)\nHaving introduced the LLM\u2019s ability to encode problems\nin PDDL and in-context learning, we are ready to introduce\nthe proposed LLM+P solution (the bottom of Fig. 1). In\nparticular, we assume that for each problem domain, a\nhuman expert can provide a domain description (i.e. action\npreconditions and effects) that will be fixed for all problem\ninstances that happen in that domain. While the problem of\nautomatically generating the description is another valuable\nresearch question, in this proposed work, we assume that the\ndescription is available as a PDDL domain file. The LLM+P\nmethod is directly applicable as a natural language interface\nfor giving tasks to robot systems. For instance, assume we\nwant a robot to act as a bartender to make cocktails. It is\nreasonable to tell it what actions it can take, but leave itself\nto infer how to make new cocktails most efficiently given\na set of ingredients to combine. Moreover, we assume the\nagent is provided with a minimal example that demonstrates\nwhat an example problem PDDL looks like for a simple\n\fproblem inside that domain. Next, the agent is provided\nwith a new (potentially quite complicated) problem (P). The\nLLM then uses the in-context learning to infer the problem\nPDDL file corresponding to P. Once the problem PDDL file\nis generated, we feed it into any classical planner, together\nwith the provided domain PDDL file, to generate a PDDL\nplan [11]. In the end, the LLM translates the PDDL plan back\ninto the natural language to finish up the LLM+P pipeline.\nTo summarize, the assumptions we need for LLM+P are:\n1) A robot knows when to trigger LLM+P based on its\nconversation with a human user.\n2) A domain PDDL is provided to define the actions\nthat the robot is capable of. This specification is taskagnostic \u2014 the entities relevant to the task are specified\nin the LLM-generated problem PDDL.\n3) A simple problem description in natural language and\nits corresponding problem PDDL file are also provided.\nIV. RELATED WORK\nThis section first provides a brief overview of classical\nplanning algorithms. Then it summarizes recent advances in\nusing large language models for planning tasks. It concludes\nwith a discussion of recent research on augmenting LLMs\nwith external modules.\nA. Classical Planning\nAutomated planning (or classical planning) techniques can\nbe used for computing a sequence of actions that achieves a\ngiven goal [12], [13], [14]. Automated planning algorithms\nhave been widely used in robot systems. Shakey is the first\nrobot that was equipped with a planning component, which\nwas constructed using STRIPS [15]. Some previous generalpurpose planning architectures were also demonstrated to\nbe useful for robot planning, such as PRODIGY [16] and\nHTN [17]. Recent classical planning systems designed for\nrobotics frequently use planning domain description language (PDDL) or answer set programming (ASP) as the\nunderlying action language for the planners [18], [19], [20],\n[21]. For example, researchers have used classical planning\nalgorithms for sequencing actions for a mobile robot working\non delivery tasks [22], reasoning about safe and efficient\nurban driving behaviors for autonomous vehicles [23], and\nplanning actions for a team of mobile robots [24]. Task and\nmotion planning (TAMP) is a hierarchical planning framework that combines classical planning in discrete spaces and\nrobot motion planning in continuous space [25], [26].\nMost of the above-mentioned planning methods require\ndomain-specific programming languages as the underlying\nrepresentation of the problems and their solutions. LLM+P,\non the other hand, takes advantage of LLMs and serves\nas a natural language interface for robots to solve complex\nplanning tasks. The main feature that motivates us to use such\nclassical planning systems is that most of these planners are\nsound and complete, meaning that they are guaranteed to be\nlogically correct and will output a plan if one exists. Many\nare also able to find optimal (shortest) plans, at least if given\nsufficient time.\nB. Planning with Large Language Models\nVarious large language models (LLMs) have been developed in recent years, such as Bert [27], CodeX [28],\nOpt [29], GPT-3 [10], ChatGPT [30], GPT-4 [2], Llama [31],\nLlama2 [32], and PaLM [33]. As LLMs are pretrained with\na tremendous amount of offline text data, they can emerge\nwith surprising zero-shot generalization ability, which can\nbe leveraged for robot planning tasks [34], [35], [36], [37],\n[38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45]. Several recent\nmethods had successes in extracting task knowledge from\nLLMs to decompose commands or instructions for robots\nin natural language. For instance, the work of Huang et\nal. showed that LLMs can be used for task planning in\nhousehold domains by iteratively augmenting prompts [38].\nSayCan is another approach that enabled robot planning with\naffordance functions to account for action feasibility, where\nthe service requests are specified in natural language [34].\nVemprala et al. recently studied how ChatGPT can be applied\nto generalized robotics domains [3].\nHowever, a major drawback of existing LLMs is their lack\nof long-horizon reasoning ability for complex tasks (See [9],\n[46] and Section 8.2 from [2]). Specifically, the output they\nproduce when presented with such a task is often incorrect\nin the sense that following the output plan will not actually\nsolve the task. Therefore, in this work, we focus on resolving\nthis issue by leveraging the properties of classical planners.\nSimilarly, some recent work also investigates approaches for\ncombining classical planning with LLMs [47], [48], [49],\n[50], [51], [52], [53], [54], [55], [56], [57]. They either\nuse prompting or fine-tuning to make LLMs capable of\nsolving PDDL planning problems. Improvements to longhorizon planning capabilities have also been made by iteratively querying LLMs, as demonstrated in Minecraft [58].\nIn contrast, we do not solely rely on LLM as the problem\nsolver, but are more into taking the advantage of both the\nplanner (i.e., generating accurate and optimal plans) and the\nLLM itself (i.e., 1-shot generalization for translating naturallanguage problem descriptions into PDDL).\nC. Augmenting LLMs with External Modules\nRecently developed methods have shown that the performance of downstream tasks of LLMs can be improved\nby combining them with external modules. For instance,\nWebGPT [59] is a fine-tuned version of GPT-3 by combining\nweb knowledge to answer open-ended questions. Lazaridou\net al. studied how search engines like Google can be utilized\nas external tools for LLMs [60]. MemPrompt [61] presented\na human-in-the-loop system where a growing memory of\nerrors and user feedback is served as past experience adding\nto the prompts for more accurately answering new questions. REPLUG [62] is another retrieval-augmented language\nmodeling paradigm that treats the language model as a\nblack box and augments it with a tuneable retrieval model.\nSpecifically, people have investigated using calculators for\ncomputation [63], [64]. In very recent work related to ours,\nSchick et al. trained a model called ToolFormer that can\ndecide when and how to call certain tool APIs by in-line\n\faugmentation on prompts for LLMs [65]. In this work, we\npropose that classical planners can be another particularly\nuseful external module. In comparison, LLM+P, does not\nrely on any fine-tuning or re-training of LLMs. By simply\nincorporating knowledge from classical planners, LLM+P\nincorporates long-horizon reasoning and planning capabilities into existing LLMs.\nThe authors are informed that a concurrent work [66]\npresents preliminary results of integrating LLMs with PDDL\nusing the SayCan dataset [34]. However, the SayCan dataset\nhas a limited scope, as it contains only three predefined\nactions. Consequently, all model variants evaluated in the\noriginal paper achieved a success rate of approximately 90%.\nDue to the homogeneity of the SayCan dataset, Lyu et al.\ndid not necessitate a rigorous definition of the domain PDDL,\nwhich can lead to infeasible plans. As a result, we consider\nour LLM+P method as a more comprehensive investigation\ninto enhancing LLMs with optimal planning proficiency.\nV. EXPERIMENTS\nWe conduct experiments to answer these questions:\n1) How well does LLM-AS-P work? To what extent\ncan state-of-the-art LLMs and LLM-based reasoning\nmethods be directly used for planning? (Not at all)\n2) How well does LLM+P work compare to LLM-AS-P?\n(Much better)\n3) What role does the context play in the success of\nLLM+P? (It\u2019s crucial)\n4) Can LLM+P help make service robots more efficient\non realistic tasks? (Yes)\nA. Benchmark Problems\nWe present seven robot planning domains borrowed from\npast International Planning Competitions and 20 automatically generated tasks for each domain [67]. Below is a list\nof the planning domains, along with a brief summary of each.\n1) BLOCKSWORLD: Given a set of piles of blocks on a\ntable, a robot is tasked with rearranging them into a\nspecified target configuration.\n2) BARMAN: A robot bartender is tasked with creating\ncocktails for a customer\u2019s order, utilizing the available\ningredients and containers.\n3) FLOORTILE: A set of robots are tasked to use paint\ncolor patterns on floor tiles. Robots can move around\nand change colors but cannot step on painted tiles.\n4) GRIPPERS: A set of robots with two grippers is given\na task to move objects among different rooms.\n5) STORAGE: Given a set of hoists, the goal is to lift\nand drop crates using the hoists into a depot. Crates\nare initially stored in different areas and hoists can be\nmoved among storage areas.\n6) TERMES: A robot is tasked to build complex structures\nby carrying and placing blocks, and also climbing on\nthem so that it can build towers.\n7) TYREWORLD: The robot is given a task to replace flat\ntires by, for example, inflating tires, tightening nuts,\nand moving tools back to the boot when done, all in\nthe proper order.\nFor each problem P, P comes with a natural language\ndescription and a ground-truth problem PDDL file. Each\ndomain also includes an example problem description, a\ncorresponding PDDL file, and a plan description, used as\ncontext in various approaches. We assume each problem\ndomain has its own domain PDDL file given by the user or a\ndomain expert prior to addressing any planning problems in\nthat domain. This dataset is made publicly available in our\ncodebase for reproducibility.\nB. Experiment Setup\nWe leverage the GPT-4 model provided by OpenAI2 for\nall experiments. We set the temperature to 0, and use the\ntop probability response. As a result, the response returned\nfrom the LLM is deterministic. Once a text PDDL response\nis generated, we feed it into the FAST-DOWNWARD planner3\nand try both aliases SEQ-OPT-FDSS-1 (guaranteed optimal)\nand LAMA (not guaranteed optimal) with a maximum search\ntime of 200 seconds. We report the success rate of the\noptimal alias, and for the domains that time out, we show the\nsuccess rate of the sub-optimal alias in parentheses. For the\nbaseline methods, we manually count the number of optimal\nplans, and report the number of correct plans in parentheses\n(if there are any sub-optimal plans).\nWe also evaluate a recent LLM-based approach for deliberate reasoning called Tree of Thoughts [68], referred to as\nLLM-AS-P (TOT). We adapt the breadth-first-search algorithm from the original ToT implementation4 for planning.\nThe LLM is prompted to expand the search tree from allowed\nactions and evaluate the paths on their likelihood of reaching\nthe goal. The same time limit of 200 seconds is applied.\nC. Results and Analysis\nThe results of applying LLM-AS-P and LLM+P across 7\ndomains are provided in Table I.\nDomain\nSuccess Rate %\nLLM\u2212\nLLM\nLLMToT\nLLM+P\u2212\nLLM+P\nBARMAN\n0\n0\n0\n0\n20 (100)\nBLOCKSWORLD\n20\n15 (30)\n0 (5)\n0\n90\nFLOORTILE\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nGRIPPERS\n25 (60)\n35 (50)\n10 (20)\n0\n95 (100)\nSTORAGE\n0\n0 (25)\n0\n0\n85\nTERMES\n0\n0\n0\n0\n20\nTYREWORLD\n5\n15\n0\n0\n10 (90)\nTABLE I: Success rate % of applying LLM-AS-P without context (LLM\u2212), LLM-AS-P (LLM), Tree of Thoughts (LLMToT ),\nLLM+P without context (LLM\u2212), and LLM+P.\nFindings (LLM-AS-P):\n1) We observe that though LLM-AS-P provides a plan\nin natural language for every problem, most of these\n2We use the most recent model as of September 2023. https://\nplatform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4\n3https://github.com/aibasel/downward/tree/\nrelease-22.12.0\n4https://github.com/princeton-nlp/\ntree-of-thought-llm/\n\f(a) grasp bottle\n(b) free gripper\n(c) grasp soup can\n(d) place soup can\n(e) re-grasp bottle\n(f) place bottle\nFig. 2: Demonstration of the optimal tidy-up plan. The robot starts at the coffee table and 1) picks up the bottle, 2) navigates\nto a room with the side table and the recycle bin, 3) puts down the bottle, 4) grasps the soup can, 5) puts the soup can in\nthe recycle bin, 6) re-grasps the bottle, 7) navigates to the kitchen, 8) places the bottle in the pantry.\nplans are not feasible. The main reason is that LLMAS-P lacks the ability to reason about preconditions.\n2) In most cases, LLM-AS-P fails in the same way with\nor without the example plan as context. In particular,\nin the BLOCKSWORLD domain, LLM-AS-P cannot\nkeep track of properties like ON and CLEAR. In the\nBARMAN domain, LLM-AS-P\u2019s plans fail to clean\nshot glasses before using them again.\n3) The hardest domains are the ones with complex spatial\nrelationship. The LLM-AS-P methods (with or without\ncontext) completely fail at this type of problems. In\nthe FLOORTILE domain, LLM-AS-P generates \u201cmove\nright to tile 0-4 and paint tile 1-2 black\u201d but the robot\ncan only paint neighboring tiles. In TERMES and\nSTORAGE, LLM-AS-P ignores the requirement that\nthe robot cannot unload the block/crate at the same\nposition it occupies.\n4) LLM-AS-P (TOT) calls the LLM at each tree node\nto provide a list of available actions, and then calls\nthe LLM to evaluate each new path on the tree as\na partial plan. We find that the LLM is able to give\nreasonable rankings on the partial plans, but it often\nfails to recognize whether the plan reaches the goal.\nLLM-AS-P (TOT) times out in most cases due to the\nlarge number of LLM calls, so it is not suitable for\nsolving long-horizon problems.\nFindings (LLM+P):\n1) The proposed LLM+P produces an optimal plan for\nthe majority of problems. Most failed cases are due to\nmis-specified problem files, such as missing one of the\ninitial conditions (e.g. leaving the tiles disconnected\nin FLOORTILE), causing the planning problem to be\nunsolvable.\n2) Without the context (i.e., an example problem and its\ncorresponding problem PDDL), we observe that LLMs\nfail to produce correct problem PDDL files. Therefore,\nthe context is important for LLM+P to work.\nD. Robot Demonstration\nWe verify that LLM+P can efficiently solve realistic\nservice robot problems by deploying it on a real robot tasked\nwith tidying up a home. The user asks the robot to move a\nmustard bottle from the coffee table to the pantry, and throw\naway the empty soup can from the side table. Since the side\ntable and the recycle bin are on the way from the coffee table\nto the pantry, the optimal plan is to take the mustard bottle to\nthe side table, and re-grasp it after throwing away the soup\ncan, with a total cost of 22. Fig. 2 shows the optimal plan\nfound by LLM+P. Parts of the prompt and the generated\nPDDL are shown below. LLM-AS-P outputs a sub-optimal\nplan which takes the bottle to the pantry first and travels\nback for the soup can, with a total cost of 31.\nTidy-Up Problem PDDL Generated by LLM+P\nProblem (P): You are a home robot with one\ngripper. The distance between coffee table and side\ntable is 10. The distance between coffee table and\npantry is 20... You are at the coffee table. There is\na mustard bottle... Your goal is to move objects to\ntheir destinations...\nProblem PDDL generated by LLM+P:\n(:objects coffee-table side-table\nrecycle-bin pantry - location\nmustard-bottle soup-can - object)\n(:init (= (total-cost) 0) (=\n(distance coffee-table side-table)\n10) (= (distance coffee-table\npantry) 20) ...

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nIn this work, we propose to leverage classical planners\nto empower large language models with optimal planning\ncapabilities. The key design choice of the proposed LLM+P\nframework is to focus LLMs on translating the planning\nproblem from natural language to structured PDDL format.\nMoreover, we show that it is important to also make LLMs\naware of a simple (problem, PDDL) pair as a demonstration\n(or the context) for in-context learning. Some interesting\ndirections to further extend the LLM+P framework include:\n1) enabling the LLM to auto-detect when and how to\napply LLM+P; and 2) reducing LLM+P\u2019s dependency on\ninformation by humans, potentially involving finetuning.\n\fREFERENCES\n[1] J.

However, so far, LLMs cannot reliably solve long-horizon robot planning problems. By contrast, classical planners, once a problem is given in a formatted way, can use efficient search algorithms to quickly identify correct, or even optimal, plans. In an effort to get the best of both worlds, this paper introduces LLM+P, the first framework that incorporates the strengths of classical planners into LLMs. LLM+P takes in a natural language description of a planning problem, then returns a correct (or optimal) plan for solving that problem in natural language. LLM+P does so by first converting the language description into a file written in the planning domain definition language (PDDL), then leveraging classical planners to quickly find a solution, and then translating the found solution back into natural language. Along with LLM+P, we define a diverse set of different benchmark problems taken from robot planning scenarios. Via a comprehensive set of experiments on these benchmark problems, we find that LLM+P is able to provide _optimal_ solutions for most problems, while LLMs fail to provide even feasible plans for most problems. We also show LLM+P enables a home robot to solve a complex manipulation task that is specified by the user in natural language. 1\n\nFootnote 1: The code and results are publicly available at [https://github.com/Cranial-XIX/llm-pddl.git](https://github.com/Cranial-XIX/llm-pddl.git).\n\n## I Introduction\n\nEver since the birth of the field, AI researchers have sought to create programs that can converse in natural language with the same grace and flexibility as people. While even relatively simple models, such as Eliza from 1966 [1], can generate responses to some prompts that seem reasonable, it has always been relatively easy to generate prompts that expose their weaknesses compared to people -- their lack of true \"understanding.\"\n\nWhile large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 [2] and ChatGPT [3] have far surpassed expectations of just a few years ago, they are no different in this respect. Indeed the internet is now awash with examples of people reveling in getting ChatGPT to generate output that even a 5-year-old human child would know to be ill-advised.\n\nGiven how LLMs are designed and trained, this phenomenon should come as no surprise. They are not specifically built to demonstrate understanding. They are trained to generate sequences of words that _might be plausible to a human_ given a prior context. In the terms of Mahowald et al. [4] LLMs have become amazingly proficient at _linguistic competence_ -- knowing _how_ to say things; but they are not nearly as good at _functional competence_ -- knowing _what_ to say. Specifically, they can be (relatively) easily fooled by, for example, asking for the result of a straightforward arithmetic problem that does not appear in their training corpus or by asking for the solution to a novel planning problem that requires knowledge about how the world works.\n\nA rolling example of GPT-4 in Planning\n\n**Problem (P1):** You have 5 blocks. One cannot place more than one block on another block. b5 is on top of b3. b4 is on top of b2. b2 is on top of b1. b3 is on top of b4. b1 is on the table. b5 is clear. Your arm is empty.\n\nYour goal is to move the blocks.\n\nb1 should be on top of b2.\n\nb3 should be on top of b5.\n\nb4 should be on top of b1.\n\n**GPT-4:**\n\n1. Move b5 from b3 to the table.\n\n2. Move b3 from b4 to b5.\n\n3. Move b4 from b2 to the table.\n\n4. Move b2 from b1 to b5.\n\n5. Move b1 from the table to b2.\n\n6. Move b4 from the table to bl.\n\nDoes that mean that we should increase efforts to include all arithmetic and planning problems in their training corpus? Clearly, that is a fool's errand. On the other hand, why should it be necessary? We already have calculators and general-purpose symbolic planners that are guaranteed to produce correct answers. Thus a natural alternative approach, and one that we are admittedly not the first to explore, is to connect LLMs to such tools.\n\nWith this motivation in mind, the objective of the research reported in this paper is, for the first time, to enable LLMs to solve planning problems _correct_ly. We aim to do so without altering the LLMs themselves, even with finetuning [5, 6]. Rather, we introduce a methodology, called LLM+P by which, when posed a natural language description of a planning problem, the LLM:\n\n1) outputs a problem description suitable as input to ageneral-purpose planner;\n2. solves the problem using the general-purpose planner; and\n3. converts the output of the planner back to natural language (or connects to action executors of a robot).\n\nOur extensive empirical evaluations indicate that LLM+P is able to generate correct solutions to many more planning problems than are LLMs on their own. While demonstrated in this paper on planning problems, this general methodology can be applied to any class of problems for which we have a sound and complete solver, such as arithmetic problems (by leveraging calculators).\n\n**Limitation:** In this paper, we do not ask the LLM to _recognize_ that it has been posed a prompt that is suitable for processing using the proposed LLM+P pipeline. A valuable future research direction will be to consider recognizing when a prompt should be processed by LLM+P.\n\n## II Background\n\nThis section introduces the notation we use for representing a planning problem to be solved by LLMs, and recaps the standard representation of classical planners.\n\n### _The Classical Planning Problem_\n\nFormally, the input of a planning problem \\(P\\) is defined by a tuple \\(\\langle\\mathcal{S},s^{\\mathit{init}},\\mathcal{S}^{C},\\mathcal{A},f\\rangle\\):\n\n* \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) is a finite and discrete set of states used to describe the world's state (i.e., state space). We assume a factored state space such that each state \\(s\\in\\mathcal{S}\\) is defined by the values of a fixed set of variables.\n* \\(s^{\\mathit{init}}\\in\\mathcal{S}\\) is an initial world state.\n* \\(\\mathcal{S}^{G}\\subset\\mathcal{S}\\) is a set of goal states. \\(\\mathcal{S}^{G}\\) are usually specified as a list of _goal conditions_, all of which must hold in a goal state.\n* \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is a set of symbolic actions.\n* \\(f\\) is the underlying state transition function. \\(f\\) takes the current state and an action as input and outputs the corresponding next state.\n\nA solution to a planning problem \\(P\\) is a symbolic plan \\(\\pi\\) in the form of \\(\\langle a_{1},a_{2},\\ldots,a_{N}\\rangle\\), such that the preconditions of \\(a_{1}\\) hold in \\(s^{\\mathit{init}}\\), the preconditions of \\(a_{2}\\) hold in the state that results from applying \\(a_{1}\\), and so on, with the goal conditions all holding in the state that results after applying \\(a_{N}\\).\n\n### _Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL)_\n\nThe planning domain definition language (PDDL) serves as a standardized encoding of classical planning problems [7, 8]. The PDDL representation of a planning problem \\(P\\) is separated into two files: a domain file and a problem file. The domain PDDL file provides a lifted representation of the underlying rules of the world. It includes a set of predicates that define the state space \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) and the actions (i.e., \\(\\mathcal{A}\\)) with their preconditions and effects (i.e., the transition function \\(f\\)). The problem PDDL file provides a list of objects to ground the domain, the problem's initial state \\(s^{\\mathit{init}}\\) and goal conditions \\(\\mathcal{S}^{G}\\). There exists a rich set of symbolic planners that implement efficient search algorithms to solve planning problems formalized in PDDL. In this work, we aim to take a natural language prompt which describes the initial state \\(s^{\\mathit{init}}\\) and goal conditions \\(\\mathcal{S}^{G}\\), formulate it in PDDL,\n\nFig. 1: LLM+P makes use of a large language model (LLM) to produce the PDDL description of the given problem, then leverages a classical planner for finding an _optimal_ plan, then translates the raw plan back to natural language using the LLM again.\n\nand leverage symbolic planners to output correct plans. We assume the domain rules are available (See the assumptions in Section III).\n\n## III Method\n\nThis section first uses a running example to investigate ways for formulating planning prompts in PDDL and then introduces the LLM+P method.\n\n### _Large Language Model as a PDDL Writer_\n\nLLMs are bad at planning (or long-horizon reasoning) [9] but they are good at describing and translating textual inputs, including re-writing planning prompts in the PDDL format. The intuition is that we can view PDDL as a different language than English, so re-writing planning prompts in PDDL is essentially a \"machine translation\" task that LLMs are known to excel at. Here we provide an example of a PDDL problem file written by GPT-4 without any prompt-engineering. As we see, the generated file appears to have the correct PDDL syntax but uses a made-up predicate (empty) and misses the initial condition that b1 is on the table.\n\n### _In-Context Learning_\n\nLLMs are known to be capable of in-context learning without finetuning their parameters. By in-context learning, we mean LLMs' ability to perform unseen downstream tasks by simply conditioning on a few input-label pairs (demonstrations) [10]. Here is a pair of problem descriptions in natural language and in PDDL provided to GPT-4 as context. When the context is included with the prompt from the example above, the resulting PDDL problem file is directly solvable by the planner.\n\n### _Large Language Model + Classical Planner (LLM+P)_\n\nHaving introduced the LLM's ability to encode problems in PDDL and in-context learning, we are ready to introduce the proposed LLM+P solution (the bottom of Fig. 1). In particular, we assume that for each problem domain, a human expert can provide a domain description (i.e. action preconditions and effects) that will be fixed for all problem instances that happen in that domain. While the problem of automatically generating the description is another valuable research question, in this proposed work, we assume that the description is available as a PDDL domain file. The LLM+P method is directly applicable as a natural language interface for giving tasks to robot systems. For instance, assume we want a robot to act as a bartender to make cocktails. It is reasonable to tell it what actions it can take, but leave itself to infer how to make new cocktails most efficiently given a set of ingredients to combine. Moreover, we assume the agent is provided with a _minimal_ example that demonstrates what an example problem PDDL looks like for a simple problem inside that domain. Next, the agent is provided with a new (potentially quite complicated) problem (_P_). The LLM then uses the in-context learning to infer the problem PDDL file corresponding to \\(P\\). Once the problem PDDL file is generated, we feed it into any classical planner, together with the provided domain PDDL file, to generate a PDDL plan [11]. In the end, the LLM translates the PDDL plan back into the natural language to finish up the LLM+P pipeline.\n\n**To summarize, the assumptions we need for LLM+P are:**\n\n1. A robot knows when to trigger LLM+P based on its conversation with a human user.\n2. A domain PDDL is provided to define the actions that the robot is capable of. This specification is task-agnostic -- the entities relevant to the task are specified in the LLM-generated problem PDDL.\n3. A simple problem description in natural language and its corresponding problem PDDL file are also provided.\n\n## IV Related Work\n\nThis section first provides a brief overview of classical planning algorithms. Then it summarizes recent advances in using large language models for planning tasks. It concludes with a discussion of recent research on augmenting LLMs with external modules.\n\n### _Classical Planning_\n\nAutomated planning (or classical planning) techniques can be used for computing a sequence of actions that achieves a given goal [12, 13, 14]. Automated planning algorithms have been widely used in robot systems. Shakey is the first robot that was equipped with a planning component, which was constructed using STRIPS [15]. Some previous general-purpose planning architectures were also demonstrated to be useful for robot planning, such as PRODIGY [16] and HTN [17]. Recent classical planning systems designed for robotics frequently use planning domain description language (PDDL) or answer set programming (ASP) as the underlying action language for the planners [18, 19, 20, 21]. For example, researchers have used classical planning algorithms for sequencing actions for a mobile robot working on delivery tasks [22], reasoning about safe and efficient urban driving behaviors for autonomous vehicles [23], and planning actions for a team of mobile robots [24]. Task and motion planning (TAMP) is a hierarchical planning framework that combines classical planning in discrete spaces and robot motion planning in continuous space [25, 26].\n\nMost of the above-mentioned planning methods require domain-specific programming languages as the underlying representation of the problems and their solutions. LLM+P, on the other hand, takes advantage of LLMs and serves as a natural language interface for robots to solve complex planning tasks. The main feature that motivates us to use such classical planning systems is that most of these planners are sound and complete, meaning that they are guaranteed to be logically correct and will output a plan if one exists. Many are also able to find optimal (shortest) plans, at least if given sufficient time.\n\n### _Planning with Large Language Models_\n\nVarious large language models (LLMs) have been developed in recent years, such as Bert [27], CodeX [28], Opt [29], GPT-3 [10], ChatGPT [30], GPT-4 [2], Llama [31], Llama2 [32], and PaLM [33]. As LLMs are pretrained with a tremendous amount of offline text data, they can emerge with surprising zero-shot generalization ability, which can be leveraged for robot planning tasks [34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45]. Several recent methods had successes in extracting task knowledge from LLMs to decompose commands or instructions for robots in natural language. For instance, the work of Huang et al. showed that LLMs can be used for task planning in household domains by iteratively augmenting prompts [38]. SayCan is another approach that enabled robot planning with affordance functions to account for action feasibility, where the service requests are specified in natural language [34]. Vemprala et al. recently studied how ChatGPT can be applied to generalized robotics domains [3].\n\nHowever, a major drawback of existing LLMs is their lack of long-horizon reasoning ability for complex tasks (See [9, 46] and Section 8.2 from [2]). Specifically, the output they produce when presented with such a task is often incorrect in the sense that following the output plan will not actually solve the task. Therefore, in this work, we focus on resolving this issue by leveraging the properties of classical planners. Similarly, some recent work also investigates approaches for combining classical planning with LLMs [47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57]. They either use prompting or fine-tuning to make LLMs capable of solving PDDL planning problems. Improvements to long-horizon planning capabilities have also been made by iteratively querying LLMs, as demonstrated in Minecraft [58]. In contrast, we do not solely rely on LLM as the problem solver, but are more into taking the advantage of both the planner (i.e., generating accurate and optimal plans) and the LLM itself (i.e., 1-shot generalization for translating natural-language problem descriptions into PDDL).\n\n### _Augmenting LLMs with External Modules_\n\nRecently developed methods have shown that the performance of downstream tasks of LLMs can be improved by combining them with external modules. For instance, WebGPT [59] is a fine-tuned version of GPT-3 by combining web knowledge to answer open-ended questions. Lazaridou et al. studied how search engines like Google can be utilized as external tools for LLMs [60]. MemPrompt [61] presented a human-in-the-loop system where a growing memory of errors and user feedback is served as past experience adding to the prompts for more accurately answering new questions. REPLUG [62] is another retrieval-augmented language modeling paradigm that treats the language model as a black box and augments it with a tuneable retrieval model. Specifically, people have investigated using calculators for computation [63, 64]. In very recent work related to ours, Schick et al. trained a model called ToolFormer that can decide when and how to call certain tool APIs by in-lineaugmentation on prompts for LLMs [65]. In this work, we propose that classical planners can be another particularly useful external module. In comparison, LLM+P, does not rely on any fine-tuning or re-training of LLMs. By simply incorporating knowledge from classical planners, LLM+P incorporates long-horizon reasoning and planning capabilities into existing LLMs.\n\nThe authors are informed that a concurrent work [66] presents preliminary results of integrating LLMs with PDDL using the SayCan dataset [34]. However, the SayCan dataset has a limited scope, as it contains only three predefined actions. Consequently, all model variants evaluated in the original paper achieved a success rate of approximately 90%. Due to the homogeneity of the SayCan dataset, Lyu et al. did not necessitate a rigorous definition of the domain PDDL, which can lead to infeasible plans. As a result, we consider our LLM+P method as a more comprehensive investigation into enhancing LLMs with optimal planning proficiency.\n\n## V Experiments\n\nWe conduct experiments to answer these questions:\n\n1. How well does LLM-as-P work? To what extent can state-of-the-art LLMs and LLM-based reasoning methods be directly used for planning? (**Not at all**)\n2. How well does LLM+P work compare to LLM-as-P? (**Much better**)\n3. What role does the context play in the success of LLM+P? (**It's crucial**)\n4. Can LLM+P help make service robots more efficient on realistic tasks? (**Yes**)\n\n### _Benchmark Problems_\n\nWe present seven robot planning domains borrowed from past International Planning Competitions and 20 automatically generated tasks for each domain [67]. Below is a list of the planning domains, along with a brief summary of each.\n\n1. Blocksworld: Given a set of piles of blocks on a table, a robot is tasked with rearranging them into a specified target configuration.\n2. Barman: A robot bartender is tasked with creating cocktails for a customer's order, utilizing the available ingredients and containers.\n3. Floortile: A set of robots are tasked to use paint color patterns on floor tiles. Robots can move around and change colors but cannot step on painted tiles.\n4. Grippers: A set of robots with two grippers is given a task to move objects among different rooms.\n5. Storage: Given a set of hoists, the goal is to lift and drop crates using the hoists into a depot. Crates are initially stored in different areas and hoists can be moved among storage areas.\n6. Termes: A robot is tasked to build complex structures by carrying and placing blocks, and also climbing on them so that it can build towers.\n7. Tyreworld: The robot is given a task to replace flat tires by, for example, inflating tires, tightening nuts, and moving tools back to the boot when done, all in the proper order.\n\nFor each problem \\(P\\), \\(P\\) comes with a natural language description and a ground-truth problem PDDL file. Each domain also includes an example problem description, a corresponding PDDL file, and a plan description, used as context in various approaches. We assume each problem domain has its own domain PDDL file given by the user or a domain expert prior to addressing any planning problems in that domain. This dataset is made publicly available in our codebase for reproducibility.\n\n### _Experiment Setup_\n\nWe leverage the gpt-4 model provided by OpenAI2 for all experiments. We set the temperature to 0, and use the top probability response. As a result, the response returned from the LLM is deterministic. Once a text PDDL response is generated, we feed it into the fast-downward planner3 and try both aliases seq-opt-fdss-1 (guaranteed optimal) and lama (not guaranteed optimal) with a maximum search time of 200 seconds. We report the success rate of the optimal alias, and for the domains that time out, we show the success rate of the sub-optimal alias in parentheses. For the baseline methods, we manually count the number of optimal plans, and report the number of correct plans in parentheses (if there are any sub-optimal plans).\n\nFootnote 2: We use the most recent model as of September 2023.

We adapt the breadth-first-search algorithm from the original ToT implementation4 for planning. The LLM is prompted to expand the search tree from allowed actions and evaluate the paths on their likelihood of reaching the goal. The same time limit of 200 seconds is applied.\n\nFootnote 4: [https://github.com/princeton-nlp/tree-of-thought-llm/](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/tree-of-thought-llm/)\n\n### _Results and Analysis_\n\nThe results of applying LLM-as-P and LLM+P across 7 domains are provided in Table I.\n\n**Findings (LLM-as-P):**\n\n1. We observe that though LLM-as-P provides a plan in natural language for every problem, most of these\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l r r r r r} \\hline \\hline \\multirow{2}{*}{Domain} & \\multicolumn{6}{c}{Success Rate \\%} \\\\ \\cline{2-6}  & LLM\u2013 & LLM & LLM\\({}^{\\mathit{ToT}}\\) & LLM+P\u2013 & LLM+P \\\\ \\hline Barman & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & **20 (100)** \\\\ Blocksworld & 20 & 15 (30) & 0 (5) & 0 & **90** \\\\ Floortile & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & **0** \\\\ Grippers & 25 (60) & 35 (50) & 10 (20) & 0 & **95 (100)** \\\\ Storage & 0 & 0 (25) & 0 & 0 & **85** \\\\ Terms & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & **20** \\\\ Tyreworld & 5 & 15 & 0 & 0 & **10 (90)** \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table} TABLE I: Success rate % of applying LLM-as-P without context (LLM\u2013), LLM-as-P (LLM), Tree of Thoughts (LLM\\({}^{\\mathit{ToT}}\\)), LLM+P without context (LLM\u2013), and LLM+P.\n\nplans are not feasible. The main reason is that LLM-as-P lacks the ability to reason about preconditions.\n2. In most cases, LLM-as-P fails in the same way with or without the example plan as context. In particular, in the Blocksworld domain, LLM-as-P cannot keep track of properties like on and clear. In the Barman domain, LLM-as-P's plans fail to clean shot glasses before using them again.\n3. The hardest domains are the ones with complex spatial relationship. The LLM-as-P methods (with or without context) completely fail at this type of problems. In the Floortile domain, LLM-as-P generates \"move right to tile_0-4 and paint tile_1-2 black\" but the robot can only paint neighboring tiles. In Termes and Storage, LLM-as-P ignores the requirement that the robot cannot unload the block/crate at the same position it occupies.\n4. LLM-as-P (ToT) calls the LLM at each tree node to provide a list of available actions, and then calls the LLM to evaluate each new path on the tree as a partial plan. We find that the LLM is able to give reasonable rankings on the partial plans, but it often fails to recognize whether the plan reaches the goal. LLM-as-P (ToT) times out in most cases due to the large number of LLM calls, so it is not suitable for solving long-horizon problems.\n\n**Findings (LLM+P):**\n\n1. The proposed LLM+P produces an optimal plan for the majority of problems. Most failed cases are due to mis-specified problem files, such as missing one of the initial conditions (e.g. leaving the tiles disconnected in Floortile), causing the planning problem to be unsolvable.\n2. Without the context (i.e., an example problem and its corresponding problem PDDL), we observe that LLMs fail to produce correct problem PDDL files. Therefore, the context is important for LLM+P to work.\n\n### _Robot Demonstration_\n\nWe verify that LLM+P can efficiently solve realistic service robot problems by deploying it on a real robot tasked with tidying up a home. The user asks the robot to move a mustard bottle from the coffee table to the pantry, and throw away the empty soup can from the side table. Since the side table and the recycle bin are on the way from the coffee table to the pantry, the optimal plan is to take the mustard bottle to the side table, and re-grasp it after throwing away the soup can, with a total cost of 22. Fig. 2 shows the optimal plan found by LLM+P. Parts of the prompt and the generated PDDL are shown below. LLM-as-P outputs a sub-optimal plan which takes the bottle to the pantry first and travels back for the soup can, with a total cost of 31.\n\n**Problem (P):** You are a home robot with one gripper. The distance between coffee table and table is 10. The distance between coffee table and pantry is 20... You are at the coffee table. There is a mustard bottle... Your goal is to move objects to their destinations...\n\n**Problem PDDL generated by LLM+P:**\n\n(:objects coffee-table side-table recycle-bin pantry - location mustard-bottle soup-can - object) (:init (= (total-cost) 0) (= (distance coffee-table side-table) 10) (= (distance coffee-table pantry) 20)... (robot-at coffee-table) (at mustard-bottle coffee-table) (at soup-can side-table) (hand-empty) (:goal (and (at mustard-bottle pantry) (at soup-can recycle-bin))) (:metric minimize (total-cost)) )\n\n## VI Conclusion and Future Work\n\nIn this work, we propose to leverage classical planners to empower large language models with optimal planning capabilities. The key design choice of the proposed LLM+P framework is to focus LLMs on translating the planning problem from natural language to structured PDDL format. Moreover, we show that it is important to also make LLMs aware of a simple (problem, PDDL) pair as a demonstration (or the context) for in-context learning. Some interesting directions to further extend the LLM+P framework include: 1) enabling the LLM to auto-detect when and how to apply LLM+P; and 2) reducing LLM+P's dependency on information by humans, potentially involving finetuning.\n\nFig. 2: Demonstration of the optimal tidy-up plan. The robot starts at the coffee table and 1) picks up the bottle, 2) navigates to a room with the side table and the recycle bin, 3) puts down the bottle, 4) grasps the soup can, 5) puts the soup can in the recycle bin, 6) re-grasps the bottle, 7) navigates to the kitchen, 8) places the bottle in the pantry.\n\n## References\n\n* [1]J.

However,\nit remains challenging for these language agents to quickly and efficiently learn\nfrom trial-and-error as traditional reinforcement learning methods require extensive training samples and expensive model fine-tuning. We propose Reflexion, a\nnovel framework to reinforce language agents not by updating weights, but instead through linguistic feedback. Concretely, Reflexion agents verbally reflect\non task feedback signals, then maintain their own reflective text in an episodic\nmemory buffer to induce better decision-making in subsequent trials. Reflexion is\nflexible enough to incorporate various types (scalar values or free-form language)\nand sources (external or internally simulated) of feedback signals, and obtains\nsignificant improvements over a baseline agent across diverse tasks (sequential\ndecision-making, coding, language reasoning). For example, Reflexion achieves a\n91% pass@1 accuracy on the HumanEval coding benchmark, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art GPT-4 that achieves 80%. We also conduct ablation and analysis\nstudies using different feedback signals, feedback incorporation methods, and agent\ntypes, and provide insights into how they affect performance. We release all code,\ndemos, and datasets at https://github.com/noahshinn024/reflexion.\n1\nIntroduction\nRecent works such as ReAct [30], SayCan [1], Toolformer [22], HuggingGPT [23], generative\nagents [19], and WebGPT [17] have demonstrated the feasibility of autonomous decision-making\nagents that are built on top of a large language model (LLM) core. These methods use LLMs to\ngenerate text and \u2018actions\u2018 that can be used in API calls and executed in an environment. Since\nthey rely on massive models with an enormous number of parameters, such approaches have been\nso far limited to using in-context examples as a way of teaching the agents, since more traditional\noptimization schemes like reinforcement learning with gradient descent require substantial amounts\nof compute and time.\nPreprint. Under review.\narXiv:2303.11366v4  [cs.AI]  10 Oct 2023\n\fIn this paper, we propose an alternative approach called Reflexion that uses verbal reinforcement\nto help agents learn from prior failings. Reflexion converts binary or scalar feedback from the\nenvironment into verbal feedback in the form of a textual summary, which is then added as additional\ncontext for the LLM agent in the next episode. This self-reflective feedback acts as a \u2018semantic\u2019\ngradient signal by providing the agent with a concrete direction to improve upon, helping it learn\nfrom prior mistakes to perform better on the task. This is akin to how humans iteratively learn to\naccomplish complex tasks in a few-shot manner \u2013 by reflecting on their previous failures in order to\nform an improved plan of attack for the next attempt. For example, in figure 1, a Reflexion agent\nlearns to optimize its own behavior to solve decision-making, programming, and reasoning tasks\nthrough trial, error, and self-reflection.\nGenerating useful reflective feedback is challenging since it requires a good understanding of where\nthe model made mistakes (i.e. the credit assignment problem [25]) as well as the ability to generate\na summary containing actionable insights for improvement. We explore three ways for doing\nthis \u2013 simple binary environment feedback, pre-defined heuristics for common failure cases, and\nself-evaluation such as binary classification using LLMs (decision-making) or self-written unit\ntests (programming). In all implementations, the evaluation signal is amplified to natural language\nexperience summaries which can be stored in long-term memory.\nReflexion has several advantages compared to more traditional RL approaches like policy or valuebased learning: 1) it is lightweight and doesn\u2019t require finetuning the LLM, 2) it allows for more\nnuanced forms of feedback (e.g. targeted changes in actions), compared to scalar or vector rewards\nthat are challenging to perform accurate credit assignment with, 3) it allows for a more explicit and\ninterpretable form of episodic memory over prior experiences, and 4) it provides more explicit hints\nfor actions in future episodes. At the same time, it does have the disadvantages of relying on the\npower of the LLM\u2019s self-evaluation capabilities (or heuristics) and not having a formal guarantee for\nsuccess. However, as LLM capabilities improve, we only expect this paradigm to get better over time.\nWe perform experiments on (1) decision-making tasks to test sequential action choices over long\ntrajectories, (2) reasoning tasks to test knowledge-intensive, single-step generation improvement,\nand (3) programming tasks to teach the agent to effectively use external tools such as compilers\nand interpreters. Across all three types of tasks, we observe Reflexion agents are better decisionmakers, reasoners, and programmers. More concretely, Reflexion agents improve on decision-making\nAlfWorld [24] tasks over strong baseline approaches by an absolute 22% in 12 iterative learning\nsteps, and on reasoning questions in HotPotQA [28] by 20%, and Python programming tasks on\nHumanEval [6] by as much as 11%.\nTo summarize, our contributions are the following:\n\u2022 We propose Reflexion, a new paradigm for \u2018verbal\u2018 reinforcement that parameterizes a\npolicy as an agent\u2019s memory encoding paired with a choice of LLM parameters.\n\u2022 We explore this emergent property of self-reflection in LLMs and empirically show that\nself-reflection is extremely useful to learn complex tasks over a handful of trials.\n\u2022 We introduce LeetcodeHardGym, a code-generation RL gym environment consisting of 40\nchallenging Leetcode questions (\u2018hard-level\u2018) in 19 programming languages.\n\u2022 We show that Reflexion achieves improvements over strong baselines across several tasks,\nand achieves state-of-the-art results on various code generation benchmarks.\n2\nRelated work\nReasoning and decision-making\nSelf-Refine [15] employs an iterative framework for selfrefinement to autonomously improve generation through self-evaluation. These self-evaluation\nand self-improvement steps are conditioned on given task constraints, such as \"How can this generation be written in a more positive way\". Self-Refine is effective but is limited to single-generation\nreasoning tasks. Pryzant et al. [21] performs a similar semantic prompt-writing optimization, but is\nalso limited to single-generation tasks. Paul et al. [20] fine-tune critic models to provide intermediate\nfeedback within trajectories to improve reasoning responses. Xie et al. [27] use stochastic beam\nsearch over actions to perform a more efficient decision-making search strategy which allows the\nagent to use foresight advantage due to its self-evaluation component.

Goodman [9] perform a qualitative evaluation\nstep that proposes optimizations to the previous generation. In this paper, we show that several of\nthese concepts can be enhanced with self-reflection to build a persisting memory of self-reflective\nexperiences which allows an agent to identify its own errors and self-suggest lessons to learn from its\nmistakes over time.\nProgramming\nSeveral past and recent works employ variations of test-driven development or\ncode debugging practices.

CodeT does not access\nhidden test cases but does not implement a self-learning step to improve code writing.\n3\nReflexion: reinforcement via verbal reflection\nWe develop a modular formulation for Reflexion, utilizing three distinct models: an Actor, denoted as\nMa, which generates text and actions; an Evaluator model, represented by Me, that scores the outputs\nproduced by Ma; and a Self-Reflection model, denoted as Msr, which generates verbal reinforcement\ncues to assist the Actor in self-improvement. We provide a detailed description of each of these\nmodels and subsequently elucidate their collaborative functioning within the Reflexion framework.\n3\n\fAction\nObs / Reward\nTrajectory\n(short-term memory)\nExperience\n(long-term memory)\nSelf-reflection (LM)\nAgent\nActor (LM)\nEnvironment\nEvaluator (LM)\nExternal feedback\nInternal\nfeedback\nReflective\ntext\nAlgorithm 1 Reinforcement via self-reflection\nInitialize Actor, Evaluator, Self-Reflection:\nMa, Me, Msr\nInitialize policy \u03c0\u03b8(ai|si), \u03b8 = {Ma, mem}\nGenerate initial trajectory using \u03c0\u03b8\nEvaluate \u03c40 using Me\nGenerate initial self-reflection sr0 using Msr\nSet mem \u2190 [sr0]\nSet t = 0\nwhile Me not pass or t < max trials do\nGenerate \u03c4t = [a0, o0, . . . ai, oi] using \u03c0\u03b8\nEvaluate \u03c4t using Me\nGenerate self-reflection srt using Msr\nAppend srt to mem\nIncrement t\nend while\nreturn\nFigure 2: (a) Diagram of Reflexion. (b) Reflexion reinforcement algorithm\nActor\nThe Actor is built upon a large language model (LLM) that is specifically prompted to\ngenerate the necessary text and actions conditioned on the state observations. Analogous to traditional\npolicy-based RL setups, we sample an action or generation, at, from the current policy \u03c0\u03b8 at time t,\nreceive an observation from the environment ot. We explore various Actor models, including Chain of\nThought [26] and ReAct [30]. These diverse generation models allow us to explore different aspects\nof text and action generation within the Reflexion framework, providing valuable insights into their\nperformance and effectiveness. In addition, we also add a memory component mem that provides\nadditional context to this agent. This adaption was inspired by Brooks et al. [3], who suggest a policy\niteration approach using in-context learning. Details on how this is populated are provided below.\nEvaluator\nThe Evaluator component of the Reflexion framework plays a crucial role in assessing\nthe quality of the generated outputs produced by the Actor. It takes as input a generated trajectory\nand computes a reward score that reflects its performance within the given task context. Defining\neffective value and reward functions that apply to semantic spaces is difficult, so we investigate\nseveral variants of the Evaluator model. For reasoning tasks, we explore reward functions based\non exact match (EM) grading, ensuring that the generated output aligns closely with the expected\nsolution. In decision-making tasks, we employ pre-defined heuristic functions that are tailored to\nspecific evaluation criteria. Additionally, we experiment with using a different instantiation of an\nLLM itself as an Evaluator, generating rewards for decision-making and programming tasks. This\nmulti-faceted approach to Evaluator design allows us to examine different strategies for scoring\ngenerated outputs, offering insights into their effectiveness and suitability across a range of tasks.\nSelf-reflection\nThe Self-Reflection model instantiated as an LLM, plays a crucial role in the\nReflexion framework by generating verbal self-reflections to provide valuable feedback for future\ntrials. Given a sparse reward signal, such as a binary success status (success/fail), the current trajectory,\nand its persistent memory mem, the self-reflection model generates nuanced and specific feedback.\nThis feedback, which is more informative than scalar rewards, is then stored in the agent\u2019s memory\n(mem). For instance, in a multi-step decision-making task, when the agent receives a failure signal, it\ncan infer that a specific action ai led to subsequent incorrect actions ai+1 and ai+2. The agent can\nthen verbally state that it should have taken a different action, a\u2032\ni, which would have resulted in a\u2032\ni+1\nand a\u2032\ni+2, and store this experience in its memory. In subsequent trials, the agent can leverage its past\nexperiences to adapt its decision-making approach at time t by choosing action a\u2032\ni. This iterative\nprocess of trial, error, self-reflection, and persisting memory enables the agent to rapidly improve its\ndecision-making ability in various environments by utilizing informative feedback signals.\nMemory\nCore components of the Reflexion process are the notion of short-term and long-term\nmemory. At inference time, the Actor conditions its decisions on short and long-term memory, similar\n4\n\fto the way that humans remember fine-grain recent details while also recalling distilled important\nexperiences from long-term memory. In the RL setup, the trajectory history serves as the short-term\nmemory while outputs from the Self-Reflection model are stored in long-term memory. These two\nmemory components work together to provide context that is specific but also influenced by lessons\nlearned over several trials, which is a key advantage of Reflexion agents over other LLM action\nchoice works.\nThe Reflexion process\nReflexion is formalized as an iterative optimization process in 1. In the\nfirst trial, the Actor produces a trajectory \u03c40 by interacting with the environment. The Evaluator then\nproduces a score r0 which is computed as rt = Me(\u03c40). rt is only a scalar reward for trial t that\nimproves as task-specific performance increases. After the first trial, to amplify r0 to a feedback form\nthat can be used for improvement by an LLM, the Self-Reflection model analyzes the set of {\u03c40, r0}\nto produce a summary sr0 which is stored in the memory mem. srt is a verbal experience feedback\nfor trial t. The Actor, Evaluator, and Self-Reflection models work together through trials in a loop\nuntil the Evaluator deems \u03c4t to be correct. As mentioned in 3, the memory component of Reflexion\nis crucial to its effectiveness. After each trial t, srt, is appended mem. In practice, we bound mem\nby a maximum number of stored experiences, \u2126 (usually set to 1-3) to adhere to max context LLM\nlimitations.\n4\nExperiments\nWe evaluate various natural language RL setups on decision-making, reasoning, and code generation\ntasks. Specifically, we challenge an agent to perform search-based question answering on HotPotQA\n[28], multi-step tasks in common household environments in AlfWorld [24], and code writing tasks\nin competition-like environments with interpreters and compilers in HumanEval [6], MBPP [2],\nand LeetcodeHard, a new benchmark. Most notably, Reflexion improves performance over strong\nbaselines by 22% in AlfWorld, 20% in HotPotQA, and 11% on HumanEval.\n4.1\nSequential decision making: ALFWorld\nAlfWorld is a suite of text-based environments that challenge an agent to solve multi-step tasks\nin a variety of interactive environments based on TextWorld [8]. Following Yao et al. [30], we\nrun the agent in 134 AlfWorld environments across six different tasks, including finding hidden\nobjects (e.g., finding a spatula in a drawer), moving objects (e.g., moving a knife to the cutting\nboard), and manipulating objects with other objects (e.g., chilling a tomato in the fridge). We use\nReAct [30] as the action generator as Yao et al. [30] has shown success in long trajectory decisionmaking using explicit intermediate thoughts. AlfWorld tasks naturally require a self-evaluation step\nas the environment can only signal if a task is complete. To achieve fully autonomous behavior,\nwe implement two self-evaluation techniques: natural language classification using an LLM and a\nhand-written heuristic. The heuristic is simple: if the agent executes the same action and receives the\nsame response for more than 3 cycles, or if the number of actions taken in the current environment\nexceeds 30 (inefficient planning), we self-reflect. In the baseline runs, if self-reflection is suggested,\nwe skip the self-reflection process, reset the environment, and start a new trial. In the Reflexion runs,\nthe agent uses self-reflection to find its mistake, update its memory, reset the environment, and start a\nnew trial. To avoid very long prompt windows that may exceed the maximum limit, we truncate the\nagent\u2019s memory to the last 3 self-reflections (experiences).\nTo avoid syntactic errors, we provide two domain-specific few-shot trajectories to the agent. We use\nthe same few-shot trajectory examples as Yao et al. [30] with GPT-3 for the LLM. AlfWorld tasks,\nReAct few-shot prompts, and Reflexion examples are included in the appendix.\nResults\nReAct + Reflexion significantly outperforms ReAct by completing 130 out of 134 tasks\nusing the simple heuristic to detect hallucinations and inefficient planning. Further, ReAct + Reflexion\nlearns to solve additional tasks by learning in 12 consecutive trials. In the ReAct-only approach, we\nsee that performance increase halts between trials 6 and 7.\nAnalysis\nA common error in baseline failed AlfWorld trajectories is when an agent thinks that it\nhas possession of an item but does not actually have the item. The agent proceeds to execute several\nactions in a long trajectory and is not able to backtrack its actions to find the mistake.

(b) Classification\nof AlfWorld trajectories by reason of failure.\neliminates almost all of these cases by using self-reflection to distill long, failed trajectories into\nrelevant experiences that can are used as \"self-hints\" in the future. There are two main cases in which\nlong-term memory helps an agent in AlfWorld: 1) An early mistake in a long trajectory can be easily\nidentified. The agent can suggest a new action choice or even a new long-term plan. 2) There are too\nmany surfaces/containers to check for an item. The agent can exploit its experience memory over\nseveral trials to thoroughly search a room. In 3, the learning curve suggests that the learning process\noccurs over several experiences, meaning that the agent is successfully balancing cases 1 and 2 shown\nin the immediate spike in the improvement between the first two trials, then a steady increase over\nthe next 11 trials to a near-perfect performance. On the other hand, 3 shows a ReAct-only agent\nconverging at a hallucination rate of 22% with no signs of long-term recovery.\n4.2\nReasoning: HotpotQA\nHotPotQA [28] is a Wikipedia-based dataset with 113k question-and-answer pairs that challenge\nagents to parse content and reason over several supporting documents. To test improvement in\nreasoning only ability, we implement Reflexion + Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [26] for step-by-step\nQ \u2192 A and Q, Cgt \u2192 A implementations, where Q is the question, Cgt is the ground truth context\nfrom the dataset, and A is the final answer. Since CoT is not a multi-step decision-making technique,\nwe give Cgt to the agent so that we can isolate the reasoning behavior over large sections of the\nprovided text. To test holistic question and answering ability, which requires reasoning and action\nchoice, we implement a Reflexion + ReAct [30] agent that can retrieve relevant context using a\nWikipedia API and infer answers using step-by-step explicit thinking. For CoT implementations, we\nuse 6-shot prompting; for ReAct, we use 2-shot prompting, and for self-reflection, we use 2-shot\nprompting. All examples can be found in the appendix.\nRobustly evaluating natural language answers is a long-standing problem in NLP. Therefore, between\ntrials, we use exact match answer grading using the environment to give a binary success signal to\nthe agent. After each trial, the self-reflection loop is employed to amplify the binary signal, similar to\nthe decision-making setup 4.1 in AlfWorld with a memory size of 3 experiences.\nResults\nReflexion outperforms all baseline approaches by significant margins over several learning\nsteps. Furthermore, ReAct-only, CoT-only, and CoT (GT)-only implementations fail to probabilistically improve on any tasks, meaning that no failed tasks from the first trial from any of the baseline\napproaches were able to be solved in subsequent trials using a temperature of 0.7 In the Reflexion runs,\nwe allowed the agent to gather experience and retry on failed tasks until it produced 3 consecutive\nfailed attempts on the particular task. Naturally, the CoT (GT) achieved higher accuracy scores as it\nwas given access to the ground truth context of the question. Still, the CoT (GT) agent is unable to\ncorrectly infer the correct answer for 39% of the questions, but Reflexion helps the agent to correct\nits mistakes without access to the ground truth answer to improve its accuracy by 14%.\n6\n\f0\n2\n4\n6\nTrial Number\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nProportion of Solved Tasks\n(a) HotPotQA Success Rate\nCoT only\nReAct only\nCoT + Reflexion\nReAct + Reflexion\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nTrial Number\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nProportion of Solved Tasks\n(b) HotPotQA CoT (GT)\nCoT (GT) only\nCoT (GT) + Reflexion\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\nTrial Number\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\nProportion of Solved Tasks\n(c) HotPotQA Episodic Memory\nCoT (GT) only\nCoT (GT) EPM\nCoT (GT) EPM + Reflexion\nFigure 4: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and ReAct. Reflexion improves search, information retrieval,\nand reasoning capabilities on 100 HotPotQA questions. (a) Reflexion ReAct vs Reflexion CoT (b)\nReflexion CoT (GT) for reasoning only (c) Reflexion vs episodic memory ablation.\nAnalysis\nWe perform an ablation experiment to isolate the advantage of the self-reflective step for\nreasoning using CoT (GT) as the baseline approach 4. Recall that CoT (GT) uses Chain-of-Thought\nreasoning with provided ground truth context, which tests reasoning ability over long contexts. Next,\nwe add an element of episodic memory (EPM) by including the most recent trajectory. For the\nReflexion agent, we implement the standard self-reflection step as a final pass. Intuitively, we test if\nthe agent is iteratively learning more effectively by using verbal explanation using language written\nin the first person. 4 shows that self-reflection improves learning by an 8% absolute boost over\nthe episodic memory learning advantage. This result supports the argument that refinement-only\napproaches are not as effective as self-reflection-guided refinement approaches.\n4.3\nProgramming\nWe evaluate the baseline and Reflexion approaches on Python and Rust code writing on MBPP\n[2], HumanEval [6], and LeetcodeHardGym, our new dataset. MBPP and HumanEval measure\nfunction body generation accuracy given natural language descriptions. We use a benchmark language\ncompiler, MultiPL-E [4], to translate subsets of HumanEval and MBPP to the Rust language. MultiPLE is a collection of small compilers that can be used to translate Python benchmark questions to 18\nother languages. We include experiments for Rust code generation to demonstrate that Reflexion\nimplementations for code generation are language-agnostic and can be used for interpreted and\ncompiled languages. Lastly, we introduce a new benchmark, LeetcodeHardGym, which is an\ninteractive programming gym that contains 40 Leetcode hard-rated questions that have been released\nafter October 8, 2022, which is the pre-training cutoff date of GPT-4 [18].\nThe task of programming presents a unique opportunity to use more grounded self-evaluation practices\nsuch as self-generated unit test suites. Thus, our Reflexion-based programming task implementation is\neligible for pass@1 accuracy reporting. To generate a test suite, we use Chain-of-Thought prompting\n[26] to produce diverse, extensive tests with corresponding natural language descriptions. Then, we\nfilter for syntactically valid test statements by attempting to construct a valid abstract syntax tree\n(AST) for each proposed test. Finally, we sample n tests from the collection of generated unit tests\nto produce a test suite T, denoted as {t0, t1, . . . , tn}. We set n to a maximum of 6 unit tests. Aside\nfrom the unit test suite component, the setup for the learning loop for a Reflexion programming agent\nis identical to the reasoning and decision-making agents with a max memory limit of 1 experience.\nBenchmark + Language\nPrev SOTA Pass@1\nSOTA Pass@1\nReflexion Pass@1\nHumanEval (PY)\n65.8 (CodeT [5] + GPT-3.5)\n80.1 (GPT-4)\n91.0\nHumanEval (RS)\n\u2013\n60.0 (GPT-4)\n68.0\nMBPP (PY)\n67.7 (CodeT [5] + Codex [6])\n80.1 (GPT-4)\n77.1\nMBPP (RS)\n\u2013\n70.9 (GPT-4)\n75.4\nLeetcode Hard (PY)\n\u2013\n7.5 (GPT-4)\n15.0\nTable 1: Pass@1 accuracy for various model-strategy-language combinations.

We further investigate the inferior\nperformance of Reflexion on MBPP Python.\nAnalysis\nWe acknowledge that self-reflecting code-generation agents are bound to their ability to\nwrite diverse, comprehensive tests. Therefore, in the case in which the model generates a flaky test\nsuite, it is possible that all tests pass on an incorrect solution and lead to a false positive label on a\ncode completion [11]. On the other hand, if the model produces an incorrectly written test suite, it\nis possible for some of the tests to fail on a correct solution, leading to a self-reflection generation\nthat is conditioned on a false negative code completion. Given the implementation of Reflexion,\nfalse negatives are preferred over false positives as the agent may be able to use self-reflection to\nidentify the incorrect test(s) and prompt itself to keep the original code completion intact. On the\nother hand, if an invalid test suite returns a false positive completion (all internal test cases pass\nbut the implementation is incorrect), the agent will prematurely report an invalid submission. In 2,\nvarious conditions are measured to analyze performance beyond pass@1 accuracy. Previously, we\ndisplayed the inferior performance of Reflexion to the baseline GPT-4 on MBPP Python. In 2, we\nobserve a notable discrepancy between the false positive labels produced by internal test execution,\nP(not pass@1 generation correct | tests pass). That is, the probability that a submission will fail given\nthat it passes all unit tests. For HumanEval and MBPP Python, the baseline pass@1 accuracies are\nrelatively similar, 82% and 80%, respectively. However, the false positive test execution rate for\nMBPP Python is 16.3% while the rate for HumanEval Python is a mere 1.4%, leading to 91% overall\naccuracy 1.\nApproach\nTest Generation\nSelf-reflection\nPass@1 (Acc)\nBase model\nFalse\nFalse\n0.60\nTest generation omission\nFalse\nTrue\n0.52\nSelf-reflection omission\nTrue\nFalse\n0.60\nReflexion\nTrue\nTrue\n0.68\nTable 3: Pass@1 accuracy for various compromised approaches on the Reflexion approach using\nGPT-4 as the base model on HumanEval Rust - 50 hardest problems\nAblation study\nWe test the composite approach of Reflexion for test generation and self-reflection\ncooperation on a subset of the 50 hardest HumanEval Rust problems. Our Rust compiler environment\nprovides verbose error logs and helpful debugging hints, therefore serving as a good playground\nfor compromised approaches. First, we omit internal test generation and execution steps, which\ntest the agent to self-reflect without guidance from current implementations. 3 shows an inferior\n52% vs 60% (baseline) accuracy, which suggests that the agent is unable to determine if the current\nimplementation is correct without unit tests. Therefore, the agent must participate in all iterations of\nthe run without the option to return early, performing harmful edits to the implementation.\nNext, we test self-reflection contribution by omitting the natural language explanation step following\nfailed unit test suite evaluations. Intuitively, this challenges the agent to combine the tasks of\nerror identification and implementation improvement across all failed unit tests. Interestingly, the\ncompromised agent does not improve performance over the baseline run. We observe that the test\ngeneration and code compilation steps are able to catch syntax and logic errors, but the implementation\nfixes do not reflect these indications. These empirical results suggest that several recent works that\n8\n\fpropose blind trial and error debugging techniques without self-reflection are ineffective on harder\ntasks such as writing complex programs in Rust.\n5\nLimitations\nAt its core, Reflexion is an optimization technique that uses natural language to do policy optimization.\nPolicy optimization is a powerful approach to improve action choice through experience, but it may\nstill succumb to non-optimal local minima solutions. In this study, we limit long-term memory to\na sliding window with maximum capacity, but we encourage future work to extend the memory\ncomponent of Reflexion with more advanced structures such as vector embedding databases or\ntraditional SQL databases. Specific to code generation, there are many practical limitations to testdriven development in specifying accurate input-output mappings such as non-deterministic generator\nfunctions, impure functions that interact with APIs, functions that vary output according to hardware\nspecifications, or functions that invoke parallel or concurrent behavior that may be difficult to predict.\n6\nBroader impact\nLarge language models are increasingly used to interact with external environments (e.g. the Internet,\nsoftware, robotics, etc.) and humans. Our work has the potential of reinforcing and empowering\nthese agents toward greater automation and work efficiency, but it also amplifies the risks when these\nagents were put into misuse. We believe that this direction of research will need more effort in safety\nand ethical considerations.\nOn the other hand, reinforcement learning has suffered from its black-box policy and optimization setups in which interpretability and alignment have been challenging. Our proposed \u201cverbal\u201d\nreinforcement learning might address some of the issues and turn autonomous agents more interpretable and diagnosable. For example, in the case of tool-usage that may be too hard for humans to\nunderstand, self-reflections could be monitored to ensure proper intent before using the tool.\n7\nConclusion\nIn this work, we present Reflexion, an approach that leverages verbal reinforcement to teach agents\nto learn from past mistakes. We empirically show that Reflexion agents significantly outperform\ncurrently widely-used decision-making approaches by utilizing self-reflection. In future work,\nReflexion could be used to employ more advanced techniques that have been thoroughly studied in\ntraditional RL settings, such as value learning in natural language or off-policy exploration techniques.\n8\nReproducibility\nWe highly advise others to use isolated execution environments when running autonomous code\nwriting experiments as the generated code is not validated before execution.\n9\n\fReferences\n[1] Ahn, M., Brohan, A., Brown, N., Chebotar, Y., Cortes, O., David, B., Finn, C., Gopalakrishnan,\nK., Hausman, K., Herzog, A., et al.

We test a two-shot ReAct +\nReflexion agent in 100 environments. However, after only four trials, we terminate the runs as the\nagent does not show signs of improvement 6. Further, the agent does not generate helpful, intuitive\nself-reflections after failed attempts. We conclude that Reflexion is unable to solve tasks that require\na significant amount of diversity and exploration. In AlfWorld, the agent is able to adequately explore\nnew environments because the permissible actions can be seen in the observations. In HotPotQA,\nthe agent faces a similar WebShop search query task but is more successful as the search space for\nWikipedia articles is more diverse and requires less precise search queries. A common problem for\ne-commerce search engines is properly handling ambiguity in natural language search interpretations.\nThus, WebShop presents a task that requires very diverse and unique behavior from a Reflexion agent.\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\nTrial Number\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\n0.35\n0.40\n0.45\n0.50\nProportion of Solved Environments\nWebShop Success Rate\nReAct only\nReAct + Reflexion\nFigure 6: Reflexion vs React performance on WebShop across 100 customer shopping requests.\nReAct + Reflexion fails to significantly outperform ReAct.\nC\nProgramming\nProgramming LLM calls require strict instructions to produce function bodies only, due to the\nextensive dialogue training of the LLMs. A few programming examples are reported below with\ninstructions highlighted in blue and templates.

However, it remains challenging for these language agents to quickly and efficiently learn from trial-and-error as traditional reinforcement learning methods require extensive training samples and expensive model fine-tuning. We propose _Reflexion_, a novel framework to reinforce language agents not by updating weights, but instead through linguistic feedback. Concretely, Reflexion agents verbally reflect on task feedback signals, then maintain their own reflective text in an episodic memory buffer to induce better decision-making in subsequent trials. Reflexion is flexible enough to incorporate various types (scalar values or free-form language) and sources (external or internally simulated) of feedback signals, and obtains significant improvements over a baseline agent across diverse tasks (sequential decision-making, coding, language reasoning). For example, Reflexion achieves a 91% pass@1 accuracy on the HumanEval coding benchmark, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art GPT-4 that achieves 80%. We also conduct ablation and analysis studies using different feedback signals, feedback incorporation methods, and agent types, and provide insights into how they affect performance. We release all code, demos, and datasets at [https://github.com/noahshinn024/reflexion](https://github.com/noahshinn024/reflexion).\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nRecent works such as ReAct [30], SayCan [1], Toolformer [22], HuggingGPT [23], generative agents [19], and WebGPT [17] have demonstrated the feasibility of autonomous decision-making agents that are built on top of a large language model (LLM) core. These methods use LLMs to generate text and 'actions' that can be used in API calls and executed in an environment. Since they rely on massive models with an enormous number of parameters, such approaches have been so far limited to using in-context examples as a way of teaching the agents, since more traditional optimization schemes like reinforcement learning with gradient descent require substantial amounts of compute and time.\n\nIn this paper, we propose an alternative approach called _Reflexion_ that uses verbal reinforcement to help agents learn from prior failings. Reflexion converts binary or scalar feedback from the environment into verbal feedback in the form of a textual summary, which is then added as additional context for the LLM agent in the next episode. This self-reflective feedback acts as a'semantic' gradient signal by providing the agent with a concrete direction to improve upon, helping it learn from prior mistakes to perform better on the task. This is akin to how humans iteratively learn to accomplish complex tasks in a few-shot manner - by reflecting on their previous failures in order to form an improved plan of attack for the next attempt. For example, in figure 1, a Reflexion agent learns to optimize its own behavior to solve decision-making, programming, and reasoning tasks through trial, error, and self-reflection.\n\nGenerating useful reflective feedback is challenging since it requires a good understanding of where the model made mistakes (i.e. the credit assignment problem [25]) as well as the ability to generate a summary containing actionable insights for improvement. We explore three ways for doing this - simple binary environment feedback, pre-defined heuristics for common failure cases, and self-evaluation such as binary classification using LLMs (decision-making) or self-written unit tests (programming). In all implementations, the evaluation signal is amplified to natural language experience summaries which can be stored in long-term memory.\n\nReflexion has several advantages compared to more traditional RL approaches like policy or value-based learning: 1) it is lightweight and doesn't require finetuning the LLM, 2) it allows for more nuanced forms of feedback (e.g. targeted changes in actions), compared to scalar or vector rewards that are challenging to perform accurate credit assignment with, 3) it allows for a more explicit and interpretable form of episodic memory over prior experiences, and 4) it provides more explicit hints for actions in future episodes. At the same time, it does have the disadvantages of relying on the power of the LLM's self-evaluation capabilities (or heuristics) and not having a formal guarantee for success. However, as LLM capabilities improve, we only expect this paradigm to get better over time.\n\nWe perform experiments on (1) decision-making tasks to test sequential action choices over long trajectories, (2) reasoning tasks to test knowledge-intensive, single-step generation improvement, and (3) programming tasks to teach the agent to effectively use external tools such as compilers and interpreters. Across all three types of tasks, we observe Reflexion agents are better decision-makers, reasoners, and programmers. More concretely, Reflexion agents improve on decision-making AlfWorld [24] tasks over strong baseline approaches by an absolute 22% in 12 iterative learning steps, and on reasoning questions in HotPotQA [28] by 20%, and Python programming tasks on HumanEval [6] by as much as 11%.\n\nTo summarize, our contributions are the following:\n\n* We propose Reflexion, a new paradigm for'verbal' reinforcement that parameterizes a policy as an agent's memory encoding paired with a choice of LLM parameters.\n* We explore this emergent property of _self-reflection_ in LLMs and empirically show that self-reflection is extremely useful to learn complex tasks over a handful of trials.\n* We introduce LeetcodeHardGym, a code-generation RL gym environment consisting of 40 challenging Leetcode questions ('hard-level') in 19 programming languages.\n* We show that Reflexion achieves improvements over strong baselines across several tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art results on various code generation benchmarks.\n\n## 2 Related work\n\nReasoning and decision-makingSelf-Refine [15] employs an iterative framework for self-refinement to autonomously improve generation through self-evaluation. These self-evaluation and self-improvement steps are conditioned on given task constraints, such as \"How can this generation be written in a more positive way\". Self-Refine is effective but is limited to single-generation reasoning tasks. Pryzant et al. [21] performs a similar semantic prompt-writing optimization, but is also limited to single-generation tasks. Paul et al. [20] fine-tune critic models to provide intermediate feedback within trajectories to improve reasoning responses. Xie et al. [27] use stochastic beam search over actions to perform a more efficient decision-making search strategy which allows the agent to use foresight advantage due to its self-evaluation component. Yoran et al. [31] and Nair et al.\n\n[16] use decider models to reason over several generations. Kim et al. [10] use a retry pattern over a fixed number of steps without an evaluation step. Goodman [9] perform a qualitative evaluation step that proposes optimizations to the previous generation. In this paper, we show that several of these concepts can be enhanced with _self-reflection_ to build a persisting memory of self-reflective experiences which allows an agent to identify its own errors and self-suggest lessons to learn from its mistakes over time.\n\nProgrammingSeveral past and recent works employ variations of test-driven development or code debugging practices. AlphaCode [14] evaluates a set of generations on hidden test cases. CodeT [5] uses self-generated unit tests that are used to score generated function implementations. Self-Debugging [7] employs a debugging component that is used to improve existing implementations given feedback from a code execution environment. CodeRL [12] sets the problem in an RL framework using an actor-critic setup to debug programs given feedback from an execution environment. AlphaCode, Self-Debugging and CodeRL are effective in fixing less-complex program bugs, but they rely upon ground truth test cases that invalidate pass@1 eligibility, and do not use self-reflection to bridge the gap between error identification and implementation improvement. CodeT does not access hidden test cases but does not implement a self-learning step to improve code writing.\n\n## 3 Reflexion: reinforcement via verbal reflection\n\nWe develop a modular formulation for Reflexion, utilizing three distinct models: an _Actor_, denoted as \\(M_{a}\\), which generates text and actions; an _Evaluator_ model, represented by \\(M_{e}\\), that scores the outputs produced by \\(M_{a}\\); and a _Self-Reflection_ model, denoted as \\(M_{sr}\\), which generates verbal reinforcement cues to assist the Actor in self-improvement. We provide a detailed description of each of these models and subsequently elucidate their collaborative functioning within the Reflexion framework.\n\nFigure 1: Reflexion works on decision-making 4.1, programming 4.3, and reasoning 4.2 tasks.\n\nActorThe Actor is built upon a large language model (LLM) that is specifically prompted to generate the necessary text and actions conditioned on the state observations. Analogous to traditional policy-based RL setups, we sample an action or generation, \\(a_{t}\\), from the current policy \\(\\pi_{\\theta}\\) at time \\(t\\), receive an observation from the environment \\(o_{t}\\). We explore various Actor models, including Chain of Thought [26] and ReAct [30]. These diverse generation models allow us to explore different aspects of text and action generation within the Reflexion framework, providing valuable insights into their performance and effectiveness. In addition, we also add a memory component _mem_ that provides additional context to this agent. This adaption was inspired by Brooks et al. [3], who suggest a policy iteration approach using in-context learning. Details on how this is populated are provided below.\n\nEvaluatorThe Evaluator component of the Reflexion framework plays a crucial role in assessing the quality of the generated outputs produced by the Actor. It takes as input a generated trajectory and computes a reward score that reflects its performance within the given task context. Defining effective value and reward functions that apply to semantic spaces is difficult, so we investigate several variants of the Evaluator model. For reasoning tasks, we explore reward functions based on exact match (EM) grading, ensuring that the generated output aligns closely with the expected solution. In decision-making tasks, we employ pre-defined heuristic functions that are tailored to specific evaluation criteria. Additionally, we experiment with using a different instantiation of an LLM itself as an Evaluator, generating rewards for decision-making and programming tasks. This multi-faceted approach to Evaluator design allows us to examine different strategies for scoring generated outputs, offering insights into their effectiveness and suitability across a range of tasks.\n\nSelf-reflectionThe Self-Reflection model instantiated as an LLM, plays a crucial role in the Reflexion framework by generating verbal self-reflections to provide valuable feedback for future trials. Given a sparse reward signal, such as a binary success status (success/fail), the current trajectory, and its persistent memory _mem_, the self-reflection model generates nuanced and specific feedback. This feedback, which is more informative than scalar rewards, is then stored in the agent's memory (_mem_). For instance, in a multi-step decision-making task, when the agent receives a failure signal, it can infer that a specific action \\(a_{i}\\) led to subsequent incorrect actions \\(a_{i+1}\\) and \\(a_{i+2}\\). The agent can then verbally state that it should have taken a different action, \\(a^{\\prime}_{i}\\), which would have resulted in \\(a^{\\prime}_{i+1}\\) and \\(a^{\\prime}_{i+2}\\), and store this experience in its memory. In subsequent trials, the agent can leverage its past experiences to adapt its decision-making approach at time \\(t\\) by choosing action \\(a^{\\prime}_{i}\\). This iterative process of trial, error, self-reflection, and persisting memory enables the agent to rapidly improve its decision-making ability in various environments by utilizing informative feedback signals.\n\nMemoryCore components of the Reflexion process are the notion of short-term and long-term memory. At inference time, the Actor conditions its decisions on short and long-term memory, similar\n\nFigure 2: (a) Diagram of Reflexion. (b) Reflexion reinforcement algorithm\n\nto the way that humans remember fine-grain recent details while also recalling distilled important experiences from long-term memory. In the RL setup, the trajectory history serves as the short-term memory while outputs from the Self-Reflection model are stored in long-term memory. These two memory components work together to provide context that is specific but also influenced by lessons learned over several trials, which is a key advantage of Reflexion agents over other LLM action choice works.\n\nThe Reflexion processReflexion is formalized as an iterative optimization process in 1. In the first trial, the Actor produces a trajectory \\(\\tau_{0}\\) by interacting with the environment. The Evaluator then produces a score \\(r_{0}\\) which is computed as \\(r_{t}=M_{e}(\\tau_{0})\\). \\(r_{t}\\) is only a scalar reward for trial \\(t\\) that improves as task-specific performance increases. After the first trial, to amplify \\(r_{0}\\) to a feedback form that can be used for improvement by an LLM, the Self-Reflection model analyzes the set of \\(\\{\\tau_{0},r_{0}\\}\\) to produce a summary \\(sr_{0}\\) which is stored in the memory _mem_. \\(sr_{t}\\) is a verbal experience feedback for trial \\(t\\). The Actor, Evaluator, and Self-Reflection models work together through trials in a loop until the Evaluator deems \\(\\tau_{t}\\) to be correct. As mentioned in 3, the memory component of Reflexion is crucial to its effectiveness. After each trial \\(t\\), \\(sr_{t}\\), is appended _mem_. In practice, we bound _mem_ by a maximum number of stored experiences, \\(\\Omega\\) (usually set to 1-3) to adhere to max context LLM limitations.\n\n## 4 Experiments\n\nWe evaluate various natural language RL setups on decision-making, reasoning, and code generation tasks. Specifically, we challenge an agent to perform search-based question answering on HotPotQA [28], multi-step tasks in common household environments in AlfWorld [24], and code writing tasks in competition-like environments with interpreters and compilers in HumanEval [6], MBPP [2], and LeetcodeHard, a new benchmark. Most notably, Reflexion improves performance over strong baselines by 22% in AlfWorld, 20% in HotPotQA, and 11% on HumanEval.\n\n### Sequential decision making: ALFWorld\n\nAlfWorld is a suite of text-based environments that challenge an agent to solve multi-step tasks in a variety of interactive environments based on TextWorld [8]. Following Yao et al. [30], we run the agent in 134 AlfWorld environments across six different tasks, including finding hidden objects (e.g., finding a spatula in a drawer), moving objects (e.g., moving a knife to the cutting board), and manipulating objects with other objects (e.g., chilling a tomato in the fridge). We use ReAct [30] as the action generator as Yao et al. [30] has shown success in long trajectory decision-making using explicit intermediate thoughts. AlfWorld tasks naturally require a self-evaluation step as the environment can only signal if a task is complete. To achieve fully autonomous behavior, we implement two self-evaluation techniques: natural language classification using an LLM and a hand-written heuristic. The heuristic is simple: if the agent executes the same action and receives the same response for more than 3 cycles, or if the number of actions taken in the current environment exceeds 30 (inefficient planning), we self-reflect. In the baseline runs, if self-reflection is suggested, we skip the self-reflection process, reset the environment, and start a new trial. In the Reflexion runs, the agent uses self-reflection to find its mistake, update its memory, reset the environment, and start a new trial. To avoid very long prompt windows that may exceed the maximum limit, we truncate the agent's memory to the last 3 self-reflections (experiences).\n\nTo avoid syntactic errors, we provide two domain-specific few-shot trajectories to the agent. We use the same few-shot trajectory examples as Yao et al. [30] with GPT-3 for the LLM. AlfWorld tasks, ReAct few-shot prompts, and Reflexion examples are included in the appendix.\n\nResultsReAct + Reflexion significantly outperforms ReAct by completing 130 out of 134 tasks using the simple heuristic to detect hallucinations and inefficient planning. Further, ReAct + Reflexion learns to solve additional tasks by learning in 12 consecutive trials. In the ReAct-only approach, we see that performance increase halts between trials 6 and 7.\n\nAnalysisA common error in baseline failed AlfWorld trajectories is when an agent thinks that it has possession of an item but does not actually have the item. The agent proceeds to execute several actions in a long trajectory and is not able to backtrack its actions to find the mistake. Reflexioneliminates almost all of these cases by using self-reflection to distill long, failed trajectories into relevant experiences that can are used as \"self-hints\" in the future. There are two main cases in which long-term memory helps an agent in AlfWorld: 1) An early mistake in a long trajectory can be easily identified. The agent can suggest a new action choice or even a new long-term plan. 2) There are too many surfaces/containers to check for an item. The agent can exploit its experience memory over several trials to thoroughly search a room. In 3, the learning curve suggests that the learning process occurs over several experiences, meaning that the agent is successfully balancing cases 1 and 2 shown in the immediate spike in the improvement between the first two trials, then a steady increase over the next 11 trials to a near-perfect performance. On the other hand, 3 shows a ReAct-only agent converging at a hallucination rate of 22% with no signs of long-term recovery.\n\n### Reasoning: HotpotQA\n\nHotPotQA [28] is a Wikipedia-based dataset with 113k question-and-answer pairs that challenge agents to parse content and reason over several supporting documents. To test improvement in reasoning _only_ ability, we implement Reflexion + Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [26] for step-by-step \\(Q\\to A\\) and \\(Q\\), \\(C_{gt}\\to A\\) implementations, where \\(Q\\) is the question, \\(C_{gt}\\) is the ground truth context from the dataset, and \\(A\\) is the final answer. Since CoT is not a multi-step decision-making technique, we give \\(C_{gt}\\) to the agent so that we can isolate the reasoning behavior over large sections of the provided text. To test holistic question and answering ability, which requires reasoning and action choice, we implement a Reflexion + ReAct [30] agent that can retrieve relevant context using a Wikipedia API and infer answers using step-by-step explicit thinking. For CoT implementations, we use 6-shot prompting; for ReAct, we use 2-shot prompting, and for self-reflection, we use 2-shot prompting. All examples can be found in the appendix.\n\nRobustly evaluating natural language answers is a long-standing problem in NLP. Therefore, between trials, we use exact match answer grading using the environment to give a binary success signal to the agent. After each trial, the self-reflection loop is employed to amplify the binary signal, similar to the decision-making setup 4.1 in AlfWorld with a memory size of 3 experiences.\n\nResultsReflexion outperforms all baseline approaches by significant margins over several learning steps. Furthermore, ReAct-only, CoT-only, and CoT (GT)-only implementations fail to probabilistically improve on any tasks, meaning that no failed tasks from the first trial from any of the baseline approaches were able to be solved in subsequent trials using a temperature of 0.7 In the Reflexion runs, we allowed the agent to gather experience and retry on failed tasks until it produced 3 consecutive failed attempts on the particular task. Naturally, the CoT (GT) achieved higher accuracy scores as it was given access to the ground truth context of the question. Still, the CoT (GT) agent is unable to correctly infer the correct answer for 39% of the questions, but Reflexion helps the agent to correct its mistakes without access to the ground truth answer to improve its accuracy by 14%.\n\nFigure 3: (a) Alfv\u00e9nWorld performance across 134 tasks showing cumulative proportions of solved tasks using self-evaluation techniques of (Heuristic) and (GPT) for binary classification. (b) Classification of Alfv\u00e9nWorld trajectories by reason of failure.\n\nAnalysisWe perform an ablation experiment to isolate the advantage of the self-reflective step for reasoning using CoT (GT) as the baseline approach 4. Recall that CoT (GT) uses Chain-of-Thought reasoning with provided ground truth context, which tests reasoning ability over long contexts. Next, we add an element of episodic memory (EPM) by including the most recent trajectory. For the Reflexion agent, we implement the standard self-reflection step as a final pass. Intuitively, we test if the agent is iteratively learning more effectively by using verbal explanation using language written in the first person. 4 shows that self-reflection improves learning by an 8% absolute boost over the episodic memory learning advantage. This result supports the argument that refinement-only approaches are not as effective as self-reflection-guided refinement approaches.\n\n### Programming\n\nWe evaluate the baseline and Reflexion approaches on Python and Rust code writing on MBPP [2], HumanEval [6], and LeetcodeHardGym, our new dataset. MBPP and HumanEval measure function body generation accuracy given natural language descriptions. We use a benchmark language compiler, MultiPL-E [4], to translate subsets of HumanEval and MBPP to the Rust language. MultiPL-E is a collection of small compilers that can be used to translate Python benchmark questions to 18 other languages. We include experiments for Rust code generation to demonstrate that Reflexion implementations for code generation are language-agnostic and can be used for interpreted and compiled languages. Lastly, we introduce a new benchmark, LeetcodeHardGym, which is an interactive programming gym that contains 40 Leetcode hard-rated questions that have been released after October 8, 2022, which is the pre-training cutoff date of GPT-4 [18].\n\nThe task of programming presents a unique opportunity to use more grounded self-evaluation practices such as self-generated unit test suites. Thus, our Reflexion-based programming task implementation is eligible for pass@1 accuracy reporting. To generate a test suite, we use Chain-of-Thought prompting [26] to produce diverse, extensive tests with corresponding natural language descriptions. Then, we filter for syntactically valid test statements by attempting to construct a valid abstract syntax tree (AST) for each proposed test. Finally, we sample \\(n\\) tests from the collection of generated unit tests to produce a test suite \\(T\\), denoted as \\(\\{t_{0},t_{1},\\ldots,t_{n}\\}\\). We set \\(n\\) to a maximum of 6 unit tests. Aside from the unit test suite component, the setup for the learning loop for a Reflexion programming agent is identical to the reasoning and decision-making agents with a max memory limit of 1 experience.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l l l l} \\hline \\hline\n**Benchmark + Language** & **Prev SOTA Pass@1** & **SOTA Pass@1** & **Reflexion Pass@1** \\\\ \\hline HumanEval (PY) & 65.8 (CodeT [5] + GPT-3.5) & 80.1 (GPT-4) & **91.0** \\\\ HumanEval (RS) & \u2013 & 60.0 (GPT-4) & **68.0** \\\\ MBPP (PY) & 67.7 (CodeT [5] + Codex [6]) & **80.1** (GPT-4) & 77.1 \\\\ MBPP (RS) & \u2013 & 70.9 (GPT-4) & **75.4** \\\\ Leetcode Hard (PY) & \u2013 & 7.5 (GPT-4) & **15.0** \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: Pass@1 accuracy for various model-strategy-language combinations. The base strategy is a single code generation sample. All instruction-based models follow zero-shot code generation.\n\nFigure 4: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and ReAct. Reflexion improves search, information retrieval, and reasoning capabilities on 100 HotPotQA questions. (a) Reflexion ReAct vs Reflexion CoT (b) Reflexion CoT (GT) for reasoning only (c) Reflexion vs episodic memory ablation.\n\nResultsReflexion outperforms all baseline accuracies and sets new state-of-the-art standards on all benchmarks for Python and Rust except for MBPP Python 1. We further investigate the inferior performance of Reflexion on MBPP Python.\n\nAnalysisWe acknowledge that self-reflecting code-generation agents are bound to their ability to write diverse, comprehensive tests. Therefore, in the case in which the model generates a flaky test suite, it is possible that all tests pass on an incorrect solution and lead to a false positive label on a code completion [11]. On the other hand, if the model produces an incorrectly written test suite, it is possible for some of the tests to fail on a correct solution, leading to a self-reflection generation that is conditioned on a false negative code completion. Given the implementation of Reflexion, false negatives are preferred over false positives as the agent may be able to use self-reflection to identify the incorrect test(s) and prompt itself to keep the original code completion intact. On the other hand, if an invalid test suite returns a false positive completion (all internal test cases pass but the implementation is incorrect), the agent will prematurely report an invalid submission. In 2, various conditions are measured to analyze performance beyond pass@1 accuracy. Previously, we displayed the inferior performance of Reflexion to the baseline GPT-4 on MBPP Python. In 2, we observe a notable discrepancy between the false positive labels produced by internal test execution, P(not pass@1 generation correct | tests pass). That is, the probability that a submission will fail given that it passes all unit tests. For HumanEval and MBPP Python, the baseline pass@1 accuracies are relatively similar, 82% and 80%, respectively. However, the false positive test execution rate for MBPP Python is 16.3% while the rate for HumanEval Python is a mere 1.4%, leading to 91% overall accuracy 1.\n\nAblation studyWe test the composite approach of Reflexion for test generation and self-reflection cooperation on a subset of the 50 hardest HumanEval Rust problems. Our Rust compiler environment provides verbose error logs and helpful debugging hints, therefore serving as a good playground for compromised approaches. First, we omit internal test generation and execution steps, which test the agent to self-reflect without guidance from current implementations. 3 shows an inferior 52% vs 60% (baseline) accuracy, which suggests that the agent is unable to determine if the current implementation is correct without unit tests. Therefore, the agent must participate in all iterations of the run without the option to return early, performing harmful edits to the implementation.\n\nNext, we test self-reflection contribution by omitting the natural language explanation step following failed unit test suite evaluations. Intuitively, this challenges the agent to combine the tasks of error identification and implementation improvement across all failed unit tests. Interestingly, the compromised agent does not improve performance over the baseline run. We observe that the test generation and code compilation steps are able to catch syntax and logic errors, but the implementation fixes do not reflect these indications. These empirical results suggest that several recent works that\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c} \\hline \\hline\n**Benchmark + Language** & **Base** & **Reflexion** & **TP** & **FN** & **FP** & **TN** \\\\ \\hline HumanEval (PY) & 0.80 & **0.91** & 0.99 & 0.40 & 0.01 & 0.60 \\\\ MBPP (PY) & **0.80** & 0.77 & 0.84 & 0.59 & 0.16 & 0.41 \\\\ HumanEval (RS) & 0.60 & **0.68** & 0.87 & 0.37 & 0.13 & 0.63 \\\\ MBPP (RS) & 0.71 & **0.75** & 0.84 & 0.51 & 0.16 & 0.49 \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 2: Overall accuracy and test generation performance for HumanEval and MBPP.

Policy optimization is a powerful approach to improve action choice through experience, but it may still succumb to non-optimal local minima solutions. In this study, we limit long-term memory to a sliding window with maximum capacity, but we encourage future work to extend the memory component of _Reflexion_ with more advanced structures such as vector embedding databases or traditional SQL databases. Specific to code generation, there are many practical limitations to test-driven development in specifying accurate input-output mappings such as non-deterministic generator functions, impure functions that interact with APIs, functions that vary output according to hardware specifications, or functions that invoke parallel or concurrent behavior that may be difficult to predict.\n\n## 6 Broader impact\n\nLarge language models are increasingly used to interact with external environments (e.g. the Internet, software, robotics, etc.) and humans. Our work has the potential of reinforcing and empowering these agents toward greater automation and work efficiency, but it also amplifies the risks when these agents were put into misuse. We believe that this direction of research will need more effort in safety and ethical considerations.\n\nOn the other hand, reinforcement learning has suffered from its black-box policy and optimization setups in which interpretability and alignment have been challenging. Our proposed \"verbal\" reinforcement learning might address some of the issues and turn autonomous agents more interpretable and diagnosable. For example, in the case of tool-usage that may be too hard for humans to understand, self-reflections could be monitored to ensure proper intent before using the tool.\n\n## 7 Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we present _Reflexion_, an approach that leverages verbal reinforcement to teach agents to learn from past mistakes. We empirically show that Reflexion agents significantly outperform currently widely-used decision-making approaches by utilizing self-reflection. In future work, Reflexion could be used to employ more advanced techniques that have been thoroughly studied in traditional RL settings, such as value learning in natural language or off-policy exploration techniques.\n\n## 8 Reproducibility\n\nWe highly advise others to use isolated execution environments when running autonomous code writing experiments as the generated code is not validated before execution.\n\n## References\n\n* Ahn et al.

We observe this shortcoming in an experiment on WebShop [29]. WebShop is a web-based problem-solving benchmark that tests agents to navigate an e-commerce website to locate and purchase products given requests from clients. We test a two-shot ReAct + Reflexion agent in 100 environments. However, after only four trials, we terminate the runs as the agent does not show signs of improvement 6. Further, the agent does not generate helpful, intuitive self-reflections after failed attempts. We conclude that Reflexion is unable to solve tasks that require a significant amount of diversity and exploration. In AlfWorld, the agent is able to adequately explore new environments because the permissible actions can be seen in the observations. In HotPotQA, the agent faces a similar WebShop search query task but is more successful as the search space for Wikipedia articles is more diverse and requires less precise search queries. A common problem for e-commerce search engines is properly handling ambiguity in natural language search interpretations. Thus, WebShop presents a task that requires very diverse and unique behavior from a Reflexion agent.\n\n## Appendix C Programming\n\nProgramming LLM calls require strict instructions to produce function bodies _only_, due to the extensive dialogue training of the LLMs. A few programming examples are reported below with instructions highlighted in blue and templates.

Motivated by how humans refine their written text, we\nintroduce SELF-REFINE, an approach for improving initial outputs from LLMs\nthrough iterative feedback and refinement. The main idea is to generate an initial\noutput using an LLM; then, the same LLM provides feedback for its output and\nuses it to refine itself, iteratively. SELF-REFINE does not require any supervised\ntraining data, additional training, or reinforcement learning, and instead uses a\nsingle LLM as the generator, refiner and the feedback provider. We evaluate\nSELF-REFINE across 7 diverse tasks, ranging from dialog response generation\nto mathematical reasoning, using state-of-the-art (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) LLMs.\nAcross all evaluated tasks, outputs generated with SELF-REFINE are preferred by\nhumans and automatic metrics over those generated with the same LLM using\nconventional one-step generation, improving by \u223c20% absolute on average in task\nperformance. Our work demonstrates that even state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4\ncan be further improved at test-time using our simple, standalone approach.1.\n1\nIntroduction\nAlthough large language models (LLMs) can generate coherent outputs, they often fall short in\naddressing intricate requirements. This mostly includes tasks with multifaceted objectives, such\nas dialogue response generation, or tasks with hard-to-define goals, such as enhancing program\nreadability. In these scenarios, modern LLMs may produce an intelligible initial output, yet may\nbenefit from further iterative refinement\u2014i.e., iteratively mapping a candidate output to an improved\none\u2014to ensure that the desired quality is achieved. Iterative refinement typically involves training\na refinement model that relies on domain-specific data (e.g., Reid and Neubig (2022); Schick et al.\n(2022a); Welleck et al. (2022)). Other approaches that rely on external supervision or reward models\nrequire large training sets or expensive human annotations (Madaan et al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2022),\nwhich may not always be feasible to obtain. These limitations underscore the need for an effective\nrefinement approach that can be applied to various tasks without requiring extensive supervision.\nIterative self-refinement is a fundamental characteristic of human problem-solving (Simon, 1962;\nFlower and Hayes, 1981; Amabile, 1983). Iterative self-refinement is a process that involves creating\nan initial draft and subsequently refining it based on self-provided feedback. For example, when\n1Code and data at https://selfrefine.info/\nPreprint.

The feedback is passed back to M, which refines the previously\ngenerated output ( 2\u20dd). Steps ( 1\u20dd) and ( 2\u20dd) iterate until a stopping condition is met. SELF-REFINE is\ninstantiated with a language model such as GPT-3.5 and does not involve human assistance.\ndrafting an email to request a document from a colleague, an individual may initially write a direct\nrequest such as \u201cSend me the data ASAP\u201d. Upon reflection, however, the writer recognizes the\npotential impoliteness of the phrasing and revises it to \u201cHi Ashley, could you please send me the data\nat your earliest convenience?\". When writing code, a programmer may implement an initial \u201cquick\nand dirty\u201d implementation, and then, upon reflection, refactor their code to a solution that is more\nefficient and readable. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs can provide iterative self-refinement\nwithout additional training, leading to higher-quality outputs on a wide range of tasks.\nWe present SELF-REFINE: an iterative self-refinement algorithm that alternates between two generative steps\u2013FEEDBACK and REFINE. These steps work in tandem to generate high-quality outputs.\nGiven an initial output generated by a model M, we pass it back to the same model M to get\nfeedback. Then, the feedback is passed back to the same model to refine the previously-generated\ndraft. This process is repeated either for a specified number of iterations or until M determines that\nno further refinement is necessary. We use few-shot prompting (Brown et al., 2020) to guide M to\nboth generate feedback and incorporate the feedback into an improved draft. Figure 1 illustrates the\nhigh-level idea, that SELF-REFINE uses the same underlying language model to generate feedback\nand refine its outputs.\nWe evaluate SELF-REFINE on 7 generation tasks that span diverse domains, including natural\nlanguage and source-code generation. We show that SELF-REFINE outperforms direct generation\nfrom strong LLMs like GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003 and gpt-3.5-turbo; OpenAI; Ouyang\net al., 2022) and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) by 5-40% absolute improvement. In code-generation tasks,\nSELF-REFINE improves the initial generation by up to absolute 13% when applied to strong code\nmodels such as Codex (code-davinci-002; Chen et al., 2021). We release all of our code, which\nis easily extensible to other LLMs. In essence, our results show that even when an LLM cannot\ngenerate an optimal output on its first try, the LLM can often provide useful feedback and improve\nits own output accordingly. In turn, SELF-REFINE provides an effective way to obtain better outputs\nfrom a single model without any additional training, via iterative (self-)feedback and refinement.\n2\nIterative Refinement with SELF-REFINE\nGiven an input sequence, SELF-REFINE generates an initial output, provides feedback on the output,\nand refines the output according to the feedback. SELF-REFINE iterates between feedback and\nrefinement until a desired condition is met. SELF-REFINE relies on a suitable language model\nand three prompts (for initial generation, feedback, and refinement), and does not require training.\nSELF-REFINE is shown in Figure 1 and Algorithm 1. Next, we describe SELF-REFINE in more detail.\nInitial generation\nGiven an input x, prompt pgen, and model M, SELF-REFINE generates an initial\noutput y0:\ny0 = M (pgen\u2225x) .\n(1)\n2\n\f(a) Dialogue: x, yt\nUser: I am interested\nin playing Table\ntennis.\nResponse: I'm sure\nit's a great way to\nsocialize, stay active\n(b) FEEDBACK fb\nEngaging: Provides no\ninformation about table\ntennis or how to play it.\nUser understanding: Lacks\nunderstanding of user's\nneeds and state of mind.\n(c) REFINE yt+1\nResponse (refined): That's\ngreat to hear (...) ! It's\na fun sport requiring\nquick reflexes and good\nhand-eye coordination.\nHave you played before, or\nare you looking to learn?\n(d) Code optimization: x, yt\nGenerate sum of 1, ..., N\ndef sum(n):\nres = 0\nfor i in range(n+1):\nres += i\nreturn res\n(e) FEEDBACK fb\nThis code is slow as\nit uses brute force.\nA better approach is\nto use the formula\n... (n(n+1))/2.\n(f) REFINE yt+1\nCode (refined)\ndef sum_faster(n):\nreturn (n*(n+1))//2\nFigure 2: Examples of SELF-REFINE: an initial output\ngenerated by the base LLM and then passed\nback to the same LLM to receive feedback\nto the same LLM to refine the output\n. The top row\nillustrates this for dialog generation where an initial dialogue response can be transformed into a\nmore engaging one that also understands the user by applying feedback. The bottom row illustrates\nthis for code optimization where the code is made more efficient by applying feedback.\nAlgorithm 1 SELF-REFINE algorithm\nRequire: input x, model M, prompts {pgen, pfb, prefine}, stop condition stop(\u00b7)\n1: y0 = M(pgen\u2225x)\n\u25b7 Initial generation (Eqn. 1)\n2: for iteration t \u2208 0, 1, . . . do\n3:\nfbt = M (pfb\u2225x\u2225yt)\n\u25b7 Feedback (Eqn. 2)\n4:\nif stop(fbt, t) then\n\u25b7 Stop condition\n5:\nbreak\n6:\nelse\n7:\nyt+1 = M (prefine\u2225x\u2225y0\u2225fb0\u2225...\u2225yt\u2225fbt)\n\u25b7 Refine (Eqn. 4)\n8:\nend if\n9: end for\n10: return yt\nFigure 3: The SELF-REFINE algorithm. See (\u00a72) for a discussion of each component.\nFor example, in Figure 2(d), the model generates functionally correct code for the given input.\nHere, pgen is a task-specific few-shot prompt (or instruction) for an initial generation, and \u2225 denotes\nconcatenation. The few-shot prompt contains input-output pairs \u27e8x(k), y(k)\u27e9 for the task.2\nFEEDBACK\nNext, SELF-REFINE uses the same model M to provide feedback fbt on its own\noutput, given a task-specific prompt pfb for generating feedback:\nfbt = M (pfb\u2225x\u2225yt) .\n(2)\nIntuitively, the feedback may address multiple aspects of the output. For example, in code optimization, the feedback might address the efficiency, readability, and overall quality of the code.\n2Few-shot prompting (also referred to as \u201cin-context learning\u201d) provides a model with a prompt consisting of\nk in-context examples of the target task, each in the form of input-output pairs \u27e8xi, yi\u27e9 (Brown et al., 2020).\n3\n\fHere, the prompt pfb provides examples of feedback in the form of input-output-feedback triples\n\u27e8x(k), y(k), fb(k)\u27e9. We prompt the model to write feedback that is actionable and specific via fb(k).\nBy \u2018actionable\u2019, we mean the feedback should contain a concrete action that would likely improve the\noutput. By \u2018specific\u2019, we mean the feedback should identify concrete phrases in the output to change.\nFor example, the feedback in Figure 2(e) is \u201cThis code is slow as it uses a for loop which is brute\nforce. A better approach is to use the formula ... (n(n+1))/2 \u201d. This feedback is actionable, since it\nsuggests the action \u2018use the formula...\u2019. The feedback is specific since it mentions the \u2018for loop\u2019.\nREFINE\nNext, SELF-REFINE uses M to refine its most recent output, given its own feedback:\nyt+1 = M (prefine\u2225x\u2225yt\u2225fbt) .\n(3)\nFor example, in Figure 2(f), given the initial output and the generated feedback, the model generates\na re-implementation that is shorter and runs much faster than the initial implementation. The\nprompt prefine provides examples of improving the output based on the feedback, in the form of\ninput-output-feedback-refined quadruples \u27e8x(k), y(k)\nt\n, fb(k)\nt\n, y(k)\nt+1\u27e9.\nIterating SELF-REFINE SELF-REFINE alternates between FEEDBACK and REFINE steps until a\nstopping condition is met. The stopping condition stop(fbt, t) either stops at a specified timestep t,\nor extracts a stopping indicator (e.g. a scalar stop score) from the feedback. In practice, the model\ncan be prompted to generate a stopping indicator in pfb, and the condition is determined per-task.\nTo inform the model about the previous iterations, we retain the history of previous feedback and\noutputs by appending them to the prompt. Intuitively, this allows the model to learn from past\nmistakes and avoid repeating them. More precisely, Equation (3) is in fact instantiated as:\nyt+1 = M (prefine\u2225x\u2225y0\u2225fb0\u2225...\u2225yt\u2225fbt) .\n(4)\nFinally, we use the last refinement yt as the output of SELF-REFINE.\nAlgorithm 1 summarizes SELF-REFINE, and Figure 2 shows an example of SELF-REFINE in the\nDialogue Response Generation (Mehri and Eskenazi, 2020) and Code Optimization (Madaan et al.,\n2023) tasks. Appendix S provides examples of the pgen, pfb, prefine prompts for various tasks. The key\nidea is that SELF-REFINE uses the same underlying LLM to generate, get feedback, and refine its\noutputs given its own feedback. It relies only on supervision present in the few-shot examples.\n3\nEvaluation\nWe evaluate SELF-REFINE on 7 diverse tasks: Dialogue Response Generation (Appendix M; Mehri\nand Eskenazi, 2020), Code Optimization (Appendix N; Madaan et al., 2023), Code Readability\nImprovement (Appendix L; Puri et al., 2021), Math Reasoning (Appendix O; Cobbe et al., 2021),\nSentiment Reversal (Appendix P; Zhang et al., 2015), and we introduce two new tasks: Acronym\nGeneration (Appendix Q) and Constrained Generation (a harder version of Lin et al. (2020) with\n20-30 keyword constraints instead of 3-5; Appendix R)\nExamples for all tasks and dataset statistics are provided in Table 4 (Appendix A).\n3.1\nInstantiating SELF-REFINE\nWe instantiate SELF-REFINE following the high-level description in Section 2. The FEEDBACKREFINE iterations continue until the desired output quality or task-specific criterion is reached, up to a\nmaximum of 4 iterations. To make our evaluation consistent across different models, we implemented\nboth FEEDBACK and REFINE as few-shot prompts even with models that respond well to instructions,\nsuch as ChatGPT and GPT-4.\nBase LLMs\nOur main goal is to evaluate whether we can improve the performance of any strong\nbase LLMs using SELF-REFINE. Therefore, we compare SELF-REFINE to the same base LLMs but\nwithout feedback-refine iterations. We used three main strong base LLM across all tasks: GPT-3.5\n(text-davinci-003), ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo), and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023). For code-based\ntasks, we also experimented with CODEX (code-davinci-002).

Metrics used for these tasks are defined in Section 3.2.\navailable (such as for Code Optimization and Math Reasoning); otherwise, we created prompts as\ndetailed in Appendix S. We use greedy decoding with a temperature of 0.7 for all setups.\n3.2\nMetrics\nWe report three types of metrics:\n\u2022 Task specific metric: When available, we use automated metrics from prior work (Math Reasoning:\n% solve rate; Code Optimization: % programs optimized; Constrained Gen: coverage %)\n\u2022 Human-pref: In Dialogue Response Generation, Code Readability Improvement, Sentiment\nReversal, and Acronym Generation, since no automated metrics are available, we perform a blind\nhuman A/B evaluation on a subset of the outputs to select the preferred output. Additional details\nare provided in Appendix C.\n\u2022 GPT-4-pref: In addition to human-pref, we use GPT-4 as a proxy for human preference following\nprior work (Fu et al., 2023; Chiang et al., 2023; Geng et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023), and found high\ncorrelation (82% for Sentiment Reversal, 68% for Acronym Generation, and 71% for Dialogue\nResponse Generation) with human-pref. For Code Readability Improvement, we prompt GPT4 to calculate fraction of the variables that are appropriately named given the context (e.g.,\nx = [] \u2192 input_buffer = []). Additional details are provided in Appendix D.\n3.3\nResults\nTable 1 shows our main results:\nSELF-REFINE consistently improves over base models across all model sizes, and additionally\noutperforms the previous state-of-the-art across all tasks. For example, GPT-4+SELF-REFINE\nimproves over the base GPT-4 by 8.7% (absolute) in Code Optimization, increasing optimization\npercentage from 27.3% to 36.0%. Confidence intervals are provided in Appendix J. For code-based\ntasks, we found similar trends when using CODEX; those results are included in Appendix F.\nOne of the tasks in which we observe the highest gains compared to the base models is Constrained\nGeneration, where the model is asked to generate a sentence containing up to 30 given concepts. We\nbelieve that this task benefits significantly from SELF-REFINE because there are more opportunities\nto miss some of the concepts on the first attempt, and thus SELF-REFINE allows the model to fix\nthese mistakes subsequently. Further, this task has an extremely large number of reasonable outputs,\nand thus SELF-REFINE allows to better explore the space of possible outputs.\nIn preference-based tasks such as Dialogue Response Generation, Sentiment Reversal, and Acronym\nGeneration, SELF-REFINE leads to especially high gains. For example in Dialogue Response\nGeneration, GPT-4 preference score improve by 49.2% \u2013 from 25.4% to 74.6%. Similarly, we see\nremarkable improvements in the other preference-based tasks across all models.\nThe modest performance gains in Math Reasoning can be traced back to the inability to accurately\nidentify whether there is any error. In math, errors can be nuanced and sometimes limited to a single\nline or incorrect operation. Besides, a consistent-looking reasoning chain can deceive LLMs to\n5\n\fthink that \u201ceverything looks good\u201d (e.g., ChatGPT feedback for 94% instances is \u2019everything looks\ngood\u2019). In Appendix H.1, we show that the gains with SELF-REFINE on Math Reasoning are much\nbigger (5%+) if an external source can identify if the current math answer is incorrect.\nImprovement is consistent across base LLMs sizes Generally, GPT-4+SELF-REFINE performs\nbetter than GPT-3.5+SELF-REFINE and ChatGPT+SELF-REFINE across all tasks, even in tasks\nwhere the initial base results of GPT-4 were lower than GPT-3.5 or ChatGPT. We thus believe that\nSELF-REFINE allows stronger models (such as GPT-4) to unlock their full potential, even in cases\nwhere this potential is not expressed in the standard, single-pass, output generation. Comparison to\nadditional strong baselines is provided in Appendix F.\n4\nAnalysis\nThe three main steps of SELF-REFINE are FEEDBACK, REFINE, and repeating them iteratively. In this\nsection, we perform additional experiments to analyze the importance of each of these steps.\nTask\nSELF-REFINE feedback\nGeneric feedback\nNo feedback\nCode Optimization\n27.5\n26.0\n24.8\nSentiment Reversal\n43.2\n31.2\n0\nAcronym Generation\n56.4\n54.0\n48.0\nTable 2: Prompting to generate generic feedback (or having the model generate no feedback at\nall) leads to reduced scores, indicating the importance of the FEEDBACK step of SELF-REFINE.\nThese experiments were performed with ChatGPT (Code Optimization and Sentiment Reversal) and\nGPT-3.5 (Acronym Generation), and metrics used are defined in Section 3.2.\nThe impact of the feedback quality\nFeedback quality plays a crucial role in SELF-REFINE. To\nquantify its impact, we compare SELF-REFINE, which utilizes specific, actionable feedback, with two\nablations: one using generic feedback and another without feedback (the model may still iteratively\nrefine its generations, but is not explicitly provided feedback to do so). For example, in the Code\nOptimization task: actionable feedback, such as Avoid repeated calculations in the for loop, pinpoints\nan issue and suggests a clear improvement. Generic feedback, like Improve the efficiency of the code,\nlacks this precision and direction. Table 2 shows feedback\u2019s clear influence.\nIn Code Optimization, performance slightly dips from 27.5 (SELF-REFINE feedback) to 26.0 (generic\nfeedback), and further to 24.8 (no feedback). This suggests that while generic feedback offers some\nguidance \u2013 specific, actionable feedback yields superior results.\nThis effect is more pronounced in tasks like Sentiment Transfer, where changing from our feedback\nto generic feedback leads to a significant performance drop (43.2 to 31.2), and the task fails without\nfeedback. Similarly, in Acronym Generation, without actionable feedback, performance drops from\n56.4 to 48.0, even with iterative refinements. These results highlight the importance of specific,\nactionable feedback in our approach. Even generic feedback provides some benefit, but the best\nresults are achieved with targeted, constructive feedback.\nHow important are the multiple iterations of FEEDBACK-REFINE?\nFigure 4 demonstrates that\non average, the quality of the output improves as the number of iterations increases. For instance, in\nthe Code Optimization task, the initial output (y0) has a score of 22.0, which improves to 28.8 after\nthree iterations (y3). Similarly, in the Sentiment Reversal task, the initial output has a score of 33.9,\nwhich increases to 36.8 after three iterations. This trend of improvement is also evident in Constrained\nGeneration, where the score increases from 29.0 to 49.7 after three iterations. Figure 4 highlights\nthe diminishing returns in the improvement as the number of iterations increases. Overall, having\nmultiple FEEDBACK-REFINE iterations significantly enhances the quality of the output, although the\nmarginal improvement naturally decreases with more iterations.\nThe performance may not always monotonically increase with iterations: in multi-aspect feedback\ntasks like Acronym Generation, where the output quality can vary during iteration with improvement\nin one aspect but decline in another aspect. To counter this, SELF-REFINE generates numerical scores\nfor different quality aspects, leading to a balanced evaluation and appropriate output selection.\n6\n\fTask\ny0\ny1\ny2\ny3\nCode Opt.\n22.0\n27.0\n27.9\n28.8\nSentiment Rev.\n33.9\n34.9\n36.1\n36.8\nConstrained Gen.\n29.0\n40.3\n46.7\n49.7\n\u2206(y0\u2192y1)\n\u2206(y1\u2192y2)\n\u2206(y2\u2192y3)\n0\n5\n10\n5\n0.9\n0.9\n11.3\n6.4\n3\n1\n1.2\n0.7\nC.

(2023) (left) and the output after applying\nSELF-REFINE (right). The initial code by the baseline, which is nearly identical to the slower input\nprogram, fails to improve the efficiency and merely alters the logic for reading input. SELF-REFINE\nfirst generates feedback that diagnoses that This code is slow because it is using six nested loops to\niterate through all possible combinations of coins to pay the amount, and suggests that a more efficient\napproach would be .... SELF-REFINE then uses this feedback to generate the revised code (right),\nreducing the time complexity to O(amount \u2217 coins). The full example is provided in Appendix H\nCan we just generate multiple outputs instead of refining?\nDoes SELF-REFINE improve because\nof the iterative refinement, or just because it generates more outputs? We compare SELF-REFINE with\nChatGPT, when ChatGPT generates k = 4 samples (but without feedback and refinement). Then,\nwe compare the performance of SELF-REFINE against these k initial outputs in a 1 vs. k evaluation.\nIn other words, we assess whether SELF-REFINE can outperform all k initial outputs. The results\nof this experiment are illustrated in Figure 6 (Appendix H). Despite the increased difficulty of the\n1 vs. k setting, the outputs of SELF-REFINE are still preferred by humans over all k initial outputs.\nThis shows the importance of refinement according to feedback over the alternative of just generating\nmultiple initial outputs.\nDoes SELF-REFINE work with weaker models?\nThe experiments in Section 3.3 were performed\nwith some of the strongest available models; does SELF-REFINE work with smaller or weaker models\nas well? To investigate this, we instantiated SELF-REFINE with Vicuna-13B (Chiang et al., 2023), a\n7\n\fless powerful base model. While Vicuna-13B is capable of generating initial outputs, it struggles\nsignificantly with the refinement process. Specifically, Vicuna-13B was not able to consistently\ngenerate the feedback in the required format. Furthermore, even when provided with Oracle or\nhard-coded feedback, it often failed to adhere to the prompts for refinement. Instead of refining\nits output, Vicuna-13B either repeated the same output or generated a hallucinated conversation,\nrendering the outputs less effective. We thus hypothesize that since Vicuna-13B was trained on\nconversations, it does not generalize as well as instruction-based models to test-time few-shot tasks.\nExample output and analysis is provided in Appendix G.\nQualitative Analysis\nWe conduct a qualitative analysis of the feedback generated by SELF-REFINE\nand its subsequent refinements. We manually analyze 70 samples in total (35 success cases and 35\nfailure cases) for Code Optimization (Madaan et al., 2023) and Math Reasoning (Cobbe et al., 2021).\nFor both Math Reasoning and Code Optimization, we found that the feedback was predominantly\nactionable, with the majority identifying problematic aspects of the original generation and suggesting\nways to rectify them.\nWhen SELF-REFINE failed to improve the original generation, the majority of issues were due to\nerroneous feedback rather than faulty refinements. Specifically, 33% of unsuccessful cases were due to\nfeedback inaccurately pinpointing the error\u2019s location, while 61% were a result of feedback suggesting\nan inappropriate fix. Only 6% of failures were due to the refiner incorrectly implementing good\nfeedback. These observations highlight the vital role of accurate feedback plays in SELF-REFINE.\nIn successful cases, the refiner was guided by accurate and useful feedback to make precise fixes to the\noriginal generation in 61% of the cases. Interestingly, the refiner was capable of rectifying issues even\nwhen the feedback was partially incorrect, which was the situation in 33% of successful cases. This\nsuggests resilience to sub-optimal feedback. Future research could focus on examining the refiner\u2019s\nrobustness to various types of feedback errors and exploring ways to enhance this resilience. In Figure\n5, we illustrate how SELF-REFINE significantly improves program efficiency by transforming a brute\nforce approach into a dynamic programming solution, as a result of insightful feedback. Additional\nanalysis on other datasets such as Dialogue Response Generation is provided in Appendix H.\nGoing Beyond Benchmarks\nWhile our evaluation focuses on benchmark tasks, SELF-REFINE is\ndesigned with broader applicability in mind. We explore this in a real-world use case of website generation, where the user provides a high-level goal and SELF-REFINE assists in iteratively developing\nthe website. Starting from a rudimentary initial design, SELF-REFINE refines HTML, CSS, and JS\nto evolve the website in terms of both usability and aesthetics. This demonstrates the potential of\nSELF-REFINE in real-world, complex, and creative tasks. See Appendix I for examples and further\ndiscussion, including broader, societal impact of our work.\n5\nRelated work\nLeveraging human- and machine-generated natural language (NL) feedback for refining outputs has\nbeen effective for a variety of tasks, including summarization (Scheurer et al., 2022), script generation\n(Tandon et al., 2021), program synthesis (Le et al., 2022a; Yasunaga and Liang, 2020), and other\ntasks (Bai et al., 2022a; Schick et al., 2022b; Saunders et al., 2022a; Bai et al., 2022b; Welleck et al.,\n2022). Refinement methods differ in the source and format of feedback, and the way that a refiner is\nobtained. Table 3 summarizes some related approaches; see Appendix B for an additional discussion.\nSource of feedback.\nHumans have been an effective source of feedback (Tandon et al., 2021;\nElgohary et al., 2021; Tandon et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022a). Since human feedback is costly, several\napproaches use a scalar reward function as a surrogate of (or alternative to) human feedback (e.g.,\n(Bai et al., 2022a; Liu et al., 2022; Lu et al., 2022; Le et al., 2022a; Welleck et al., 2022)). Alternative\nsources such as compilers (Yasunaga and Liang, 2020) or Wikipedia edits (Schick et al., 2022b) can\nprovide domain-specific feedback. Recently, LLMs have been used to generate feedback for general\ndomains (Fu et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2022), However, ours is the only method that\ngenerates feedback using an LLM on its own output, for the purpose of refining with the same LLM.\nRepresentation of feedback.\nThe form of feedback can be generally divided into natural language\n(NL) and non-NL feedback. Non-NL feedback can come in human-provided example pairs (Dasgupta\n8\n\fSupervisionfree refiner\nSupervisionfree feedback\nMulti-aspect\nfeedback\nIterative\nLearned refiners:\nPEER (Schick et al.,\n2022b), Self-critique (Saunders et al., 2022b),\nCodeRL (Le et al., 2022b), Self-correction\n(Welleck et al., 2022).\nor\nor\nPrompted refiners: Augmenter (Peng et al.,\n2023), Re3 (Yang et al., 2022), Reflexion\n(Shinn et al., 2023).\nor\nSELF-REFINE (this work)\nTable 3: A comparison of SELF-REFINE to closely related prior refinement approaches.\net al., 2019) or scalar rewards (Liu et al., 2022; Le et al., 2022b). In this work, we use NL feedback,\nsince this allows the model to easily provide self-feedback using the same LM that generated the\noutput, while leveraging existing pretrained LLMs such as GPT-4.\nTypes of refiners.\nPairs of feedback and refinement have been used to learn supervised refiners\n(Schick et al., 2022b; Du et al., 2022; Yasunaga and Liang, 2020; Madaan et al., 2021). Since\ngathering supervised data is costly, some methods learn refiners using model generations (Welleck\net al., 2022; Peng et al., 2023). However, the refiners are trained for each new domain. Finally, (Yang\net al., 2022) use prompted feedback and refinement specifically tailored for story generation. In this\nwork, we avoid training a separate refiner, and show that the same model can be used as both the\nrefiner and the source of feedback across multiple domains.\nNon-refinement reinforcement learning (RL) approaches.\nRather than having explicit refinement,\nan alternative way to incorporate feedback is by optimizing a scalar reward function, e.g. with\nreinforcement learning (e.g., Stiennon et al. (2020); Lu et al. (2022); Le et al. (2022a)). These\nmethods differ from SELF-REFINE in that the model does not access feedback on an intermediate\ngeneration. Second, these RL methods require updating the model\u2019s parameters, unlike SELF-REFINE.\n6\nLimitations and Discussion\nThe main limitation of our approach is that the base models need to have sufficient few-shot modeling\nor instruction-following abilities, in order to learn to provide feedback and to refine in an in-context\nfashion, without having to train supervised models and rely on supervised data.\nFurther, the experiments in this work were performed with language models that are not open-sourced,\nnamely GPT-3.5, ChatGPT, GPT-4, and CODEX. Existing literature (Ouyang et al., 2022) does not\nfully describe the details of these models, such as the pretraining corpus, model sizes, and model\nbiases. Further, these models are not free to use, and using them for research requires some funding.\nNonetheless, we release our code and model outputs to ensure the reproducibility of our work.\nAnother limitation of our work is that we exclusively experiment with datasets in English. In other\nlanguages, the current models may not provide the same benefits.\nFinally, there is a possibility for bad actors to use prompting techniques to steer a model to generate\nmore toxic or harmful text. Our approach does not explicitly guard against this.\n7\nConclusion\nWe present SELF-REFINE: a novel approach that allows large language models to iteratively provide\nself-feedback and refine their own outputs. SELF-REFINE operates within a single LLM, requiring\nneither additional training data nor reinforcement learning. We demonstrate the simplicity and ease of\nuse of SELF-REFINE across a wide variety of tasks. By showcasing the potential of SELF-REFINE in\ndiverse tasks, our research contributes to the ongoing exploration and development of large language\nmodels, with the aim of reducing the cost of human creative processes in real-world settings. We\n9\n\fhope that our iterative approach will help drive further research in this area. To this end, we make all\nour code, data and prompts anonymously available at https://selfrefine.info/.\nReferences\nTeresa M. Amabile. 1983. A Theoretical Framework.

For every task, we demonstrate a single iteration of refinement of input x, the\npreviously generated output yt, the feedback generated fbt, and the refinement yt+1. Few-shot\nprompts used for FEEDBACK and REFINE are provided in Appendix S.\n14\n\fB\nBroader Related Work\nCompared to a concurrent work, Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023), our approach involves correction\nusing feedback, whereas their setup involves finding the next best solution in planning using ReAct.\nWhile ReAct and Reflexion provide a free-form reflection on whether a step was executed correctly\nand potential improvements, our approach is more granular and structured, with multi-dimensional\nfeedback and scores. This distinction allows our method to offer more precise and actionable feedback,\nmaking it suitable for a wider range of natural language generation tasks, including those that may\nnot necessarily involve step-by-step planning such as open-ended dialogue generation.\nComparison with Welleck et al. (2022)\nThe closest work to ours may be Self-Correction (Welleck\net al., 2022); however, Self-Correction has several disadvantages compared to SELF-REFINE:\n1. Self-Correction does not train their model to generate explicit feedback; instead, Welleck\net al. (2022) trained their models to refine only. As we show in Section 4 and Table 2, having\nthe model generate explicit feedback results in significantly better refined outputs.\n2. Self-Correction trains a separate refiner (or \u201ccorrector\u201d) for each task. In contrast, SELFREFINE uses instructions and few-shot prompting, and thus does not require training a\nseparate refiner for each task.\n3. Empirically, we evaluated SELF-REFINE using the same base model of GPT-3 as SelfCorrection, and with the same settings on the GSM8K benchmark. Self-Correction achieved\n45.9% accuracy while SELF-REFINE (this work) achieved 55.7% (\u21919.8).\nComparison with non-refinement reinforcement learning (RL) approaches.\nRather than having\nan explicit refinement module, an alternative way to incorporate feedback is by optimizing a scalar\nreward function, e.g. with reinforcement learning (e.g., Stiennon et al. (2020); Lu et al. (2022); Le\net al. (2022a)). These methods differ from SELF-REFINE (and more generally, refinement-based\napproaches) in that the model cannot access feedback on an intermediate generation. Second, these\nreinforcement learning methods require updating the model\u2019s parameters, unlike SELF-REFINE.\nSee Table 5 for an additional detailed comparison of related work.\nMethod\nPrimary Novelty\nzero/few shot improvement\nmulti aspect critics\nNL feedback with error localization\niterative framework\nRLHF (Stiennon et al., 2020)\noptimize for human preference\ntrained on feedback\nsingle (human)\n(not self gen.)\nRainier RL (Liu et al., 2022)\nRL to generate knowledge\ntrained on end task\nsingle(accuracy)\n(knowl. only)\nQUARK RL (Lu et al., 2022)\nquantization to edit generations\ntrained on end task\nsingle(scalar score)\n(dense signal)\n(train time iter.)\nCode RL (Le et al., 2022a)\nactor critic RL for code improvement\ntrained on end task\nsingle(unit tests)\n(dense signal)\nDrRepair (Yasunaga and Liang, 2020)\nCompiler feedback to iteratively repair\ntrained semi sup.\nsingle(compiler msg)\n(not self gen.)\nPEER (Schick et al., 2022b)\ndoc. edit trained on wiki edits\ntrained on edits\nsingle(accuracy)\n(not self gen.)\nSelf critique (Saunders et al., 2022a)\nfew shot critique generation\nfeedback training\nsingle(human)\n(self gen.)\nSelf-correct (Welleck et al., 2022)\nnovel training of a corrector\ntrained on end task\nsingle (task specific)\n(limited setting)\n(limited setting)\nConst.

The setup was blind, i.e., the judges did not know which outputs were generated\nby which method. The judge was then asked to select the output that is better aligned with the\ntask instruction. For tasks that involve A/B evaluation, we calculate the relative improvement as\nthe percentage increase in preference rate. The preference rate represents the proportion of times\nannotators selected the output produced by SELF-REFINE over the output from the baseline method.\nTable 6 shows the results.\nTask\nSELF-REFINE (%)\nDirect (%)\nEither (%)\nSentiment Transfer\n75.00\n21.43\n3.57\nAcronym Generation\n44.59\n12.16\n43.24\nResponse Generation\n47.58\n19.66\n32.76\nTable 6: Relative improvement of SELF-REFINE in A/B evaluations across different tasks. The values\nrepresent normalized preferences, which correspond to the proportion of times the output generated\nby SELF-REFINE was selected as better aligned with the task instruction over the baseline method.\nThe evaluation was conducted for 150 examples for each dataset. The judges were not aware of the\nmethod that generated each sample.\n16\n\fD\nGPT-4 Evaluation\nIn light of the impressive achievements of GPT-4 in assessing and providing reasoning for complex\ntasks, we leverage its abilities for evaluation in SELF-REFINE. The approach involves presenting\ntasks to GPT-4 in a structured manner, promoting the model\u2019s deliberation on the task and generating\na rationale for its decision. This methodology is demonstrated in Listings 1 to 3:\nListing 1 Prompt for GPT-4 evaluation of Sentiment Reversal.\nf\"\"\"Which review is aligned with the sentiment {target_sentiment}?\nReview A: {review_a}\nReview B: {review_b}.\nPick your answer from ['Review A', 'Review B', 'both', 'neither'].

Scalene, an off-the-shelf optimizer, uses\ninstruction tuning with Codex and serves as a comparison point.\n19\n\fG\nEvaluation of Vicuna-13b\nWe also experiment with Vicuna-13b (Chiang et al., 2023), a version of LLaMA-13b (Touvron et al.,\n2023) fine-tuned on conversations sourced from the web. Vicuna-13b was able to consistently follow\nthe task initialization prompt. However, it struggled to follow the prompts intended for feedback\nand refinement. This often led to outputs that resembled assistant-like responses, a representative\nexample of which can be found in Appendix G.\nIt\u2019s important to note that we used the same prompts for Vicuna-13b as those used with other models\nin our study. However, the limited performance of Vicuna-13b suggests that this model may require\nmore extensive prompt-engineering for optimal performance.\nMixed-refine: Improving Vicuna-13b with ChatGPT\nWhile the focus of SELF-REFINE is\nimprovement of the model without any external help, it may be possible to use a smaller model for\nthe initialization, and then involving a bigger model for refinement. To test this, we experiment with\na setup where we use Vicuna-13b as the initialization model, and use ChatGPT as the FEEDBACK and\nREFINE. The results on Math Reasoning show the promise of this approach: while Vicuna-13b was\nable to get only 24.18% on Math Reasoning, it was able to improve to 40.5% in this mixed-refinement\nsetting.\n20\n\fStep 0 INIT> The food was amazing, I loved it!!.\nStep 0 TRANSFER> The food was terrible, I hated it!!.\nlist index out of range\nAn error occurred: list index out of range.

A similar selection is possible for other tasks like Math Reasoning and\nSentiment Reversal, while we observe that output quality increases monotonically with iterations.\n22\n\fError Type\nOccurrence\nFeedback\nRefinement\nIncorrect feedback\n25%\nInformative: The response\nprovides some encouragement and reassurance, and\nadditional information. 3/3\nResponse:\nThat\u2019s hilarious!\nDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll\ndo much better when you take\nHistory next semester.\nAre\nyou looking forward to it?\nGeneric feedback\n30%\nSpecific: The response is\nnot specific and does not\nprovide any details or examples. 1/3\nResponse: It\u2019s understandable,\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do much better when you take History next\nsemester.

We provide representative\nexamples of the system\u2019s responses and refinements for each error type. These errors highlight\npotential areas for improving our feedback handling mechanism, particularly in the interpretation and\nunderstanding of user inputs.\nTable 12 breaks down errors found in the refinement stage of SELF-REFINE. Errors include: not being\nrobust (10%), ignoring feedback (25%), and introducing a new problem (20%). We demonstrate how\nthe model handles a variety of feedback types, how robust it is under different circumstances, and\nhow often it inadvertently introduces new issues. 60% of the times, the model is robust to incorrect\nor generic feedback. These insights can guide us in enhancing the model\u2019s refinement capabilities,\nespecially in providing accurate and specific responses.\n24\n\fI\nBeyond Benchmarks\nSELF-REFINE demonstrates its iterative feedback and refinement capabilities in the context of\nwebsite layout generation. ChatGPT initially produces a rudimentary layout for a given topic, and\nthen uses the FEEDBACK to suggest specific, actionable improvements, as demonstrated in Figures 7\nand 9. These suggestions range from design changes such as color and font adjustments, to content\nenhancements and layout modifications. Figures 8 and 10 showcase the final layouts, post-feedback\nimplementation, highlighting the potential and versatility of SELF-REFINE across different scenarios.\nFigure 7: Initial web layout generated by our model for a fictional ice cream parlor.\nIce Cream Generation\nThe feedback generated by FEEDBACK for ice cream generation:\n\u2022 Change the background color of the container to a light blue color (#6f2ff).\n\u2022 Change the font size of the heading to 48px.\n\u2022 Add a small icon before the \"Welcome to our ice cream parlor!\" text using the URL https://cdnicons-png.flaticon.com/512/3622/3622340.png.\n\u2022 Add an additional paragraph after the existing text with the following text: \"We also offer a variety\nof toppings and cones to complement your ice cream.

On various tasks using GPT-3.5, ChatGPT, and GPT-4 as\nbase LLM, SELF-REFINE consistently improves LLM. Metrics used for these tasks are defined in\nSection 3.2 as follows: Math Reasoning uses the solve rate; Code Optimization uses the percentage\nof programs optimized; and Sentiment Reversal, Dialogue Response and Acronym Gen use a GPT4-based preference evaluation, which measures the percentage of times outputs from the base or\nenhanced models were selected, with the rest categorized as a tie.

We find that nearly all of GPT-4 gains are\nstatistically significant, ChatGPT gains are significant for 4 out of 7 datasets, and GPT-3.5 gains are\nsignificant for 3 out of 7 datasets.\n28\n\fK\nNew Tasks\nConstrained Generation\nWe introduce \u201cCommonGen-Hard,\" a more challenging extension of the\nCommonGen dataset (Lin et al., 2020), designed to test state-of-the-art language models\u2019 advanced\ncommonsense reasoning, contextual understanding, and creative problem-solving. CommonGenHard requires models to generate coherent sentences incorporating 20-30 concepts, rather than only\nthe 3-5 related concepts given in CommonGen. SELF-REFINE focuses on iterative creation with\nintrospective feedback, making it suitable for evaluating the effectiveness of language models on the\nCommonGen-Hard task.\nAcronym Generation\nAcronym generation requires an iterative refinement process to create\nconcise and memorable representations of complex terms or phrases, involving tradeoffs between\nlength, ease of pronunciation, and relevance, and thus serves as a natural testbed for our approach.\nWe source a dataset of 250 acronyms4 and manually prune it to remove offensive or uninformative\nacronyms.\nL\nCode Readability\nOrthogonal to the correctness, readability is another important quality of a piece of code: though not\nrelated to the execution results of the code, code readability may significantly affect the usability,\nupgradability, and ease of maintenance of an entire codebase. In this section, we consider the problem\nof improving the readability of code with SELF-REFINE. We let an LLM write natural language\nreadability critiques for a piece of code; the generated critiques then guide another LLM to improve\nthe code\u2019s readability.\nL.1\nMethod\nFollowing the SELF-REFINE setup, we instantiate INIT, FEEDBACK, and REFINE. The INIT is a no-op\n\u2014 we directly start by critiquing the code with FEEDBACK and applying the changes with REFINE.\n\u2022 FEEDBACK We prompt an LLM with the given code and an instruction to provide feedback\non readability. We give the LLM the freedom to freely choose the type of enhancements\nand express them in the form of free text.\n\u2022 REFINE The code generator LLM is prompted with the piece of code and the readability\nimprovement feedback provided by FEEDBACK. In addition, we also supply an instruction\nto fix the code using the feedback. We take the generation from the code generator as the\nproduct of one iteration in the feedback loop.\nStarting from an initial piece of code y0, we first critique, c1 = critique(y0), and then edit the\ncode, y1 = editor(y0, c1). This is recursively performed N times, where ck+1 = critique(yk) and\nyk+1 = editor(yk, ck+1).\nL.2\nExperiments\nDataset\nWe use the CodeNet (Puri et al., 2021) dataset of competitive programming.5 For our\npurpose, these are hard-to-read multi-line code snippets. We consider a random subset of 300\nexamples and apply SELF-REFINE to them.\nWe also ask human annotators to edit a 60-example subset to assess human performance on this task.\nThe human annotators are asked to read the code piece and improve its readability.\nImplementation\nBoth the critique and the editor models are based on the InstructGPT model (textdavinci-003). We consider the temperature of both T = 0.0 (greedy) and T = 0.7 (sampling)\nfor decoding Natural Language suggestion from the critique model. We always use a temperature\nT = 0.0 (greedy) when decoding Programming Language from the code editor. Due to budget\nconstraints, we run SELF-REFINE for N = 5 iterations. The exact prompts we use can be found in\nFigures 22-23.\n4https://github.com/krishnakt031990/Crawl-Wiki-For-Acronyms/blob/master/AcronymsFile.csv\n5https://github.com/IBM/Project_CodeNet\n29\n\fMeaningful Variable Ratio\nComment Per Line\nFunction Units\nHuman Annotator Rewrites\n0.653\n0.24\n0.70\nSELF-REFINE (T = 0.0)\n0.628\n0.12\n1.41\nSELF-REFINE (T = 0.7)\n0.700\n0.25\n1.33\nTable 14: Human v.s. SELF-REFINE performance on 60-example subset. We see SELF-REFINE can\nreach similar or achieve even better performance on the metrics compared to rewrites given by human\nannotator.\nEvaluation Methods\nWe consider a few automatic heuristic-based evaluation metrics,\n\u2022 Meaningful Variable Names: In order to understand the flow of a program, having semantically meaningful variable names can offer much useful information. We compute the ratio\nof meaningful variables, the number of distinct variables with meaningful names to the total\nnumber of distinct variables. We automate the process of extracting distinct variables and\nthe meaningful subset of variables using a few-shot prompted language model.\n\u2022 Comments: Natural language comments give explicit hints on the intent of the code. We\ncompute the average number of comment pieces per code line.\n\u2022 Function Units: Long functions are hard to parse. Seasoned programmers will often refactor\nand modularize code into smaller functional units.\nResult\nFor each automatic evaluation metric, the ratio of meaningful variable, of comment, and\nthe number of function units, we compute for each iteration averaged across all test examples and\nplot for each SELF-REFINE iteration in Figure 11(a), Figure 11(b) and Figure 11(c) respectively.\nThe two curves each correspond to critique with temperature T = 0.0 and T = 0.7. The iteration 0\nnumber is measured from the original input code piece from CodeNet. We observe the average of all\nthree metrics grows across iteration of feedback loops. A diverse generation of a higher temperature\nin the critique leads to more edits to improve the meaningfulness of variable names and to add\ncomments. The greedy critique, on the other hand, provides more suggestions on refactoring the code\nfor modularization. Figure 12 provides an example of code-readability improving over iterations.\nIn Table 14, we measure human performance on all three metrics and compare with SELF-REFINE\nlast iteration output. At T = 0.7, SELF-REFINE produces more meaning variables, more function\nunits and slightly more comments compared to the human annotators on average. At T = 0.0,\nSELF-REFINE produces less meaningful variables, less comments per line but even more function\nunits.\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nIteration\ny\nT=0.0\nT=0.7\n(a) Meaningful variable ratio across\ndifferent SELF-REFINE iterations.\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\nIteration\ny\nT=0.0\nT=0.7\n(b) Comment per line ratio across\ndifferent SELF-REFINE iterations.\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\nIteration\ny\nT=0.0\nT=0.7\n(c) Number of function units across\ndifferent SELF-REFINE iterations.\nFigure 11: Evaluation on code readability task with SELF-REFINE across multiple metrics\nExample\nM\nDialogue Response Generation\nOpen-domain dialogue response generation is a complex task that requires a system to generate\nhuman-like responses to a wide range of topics. Due to the open-ended nature of the task, it is\n30\n\fStarting Code: v0\nprint((int((int(eval(input()))+1)/2)))\nCode v1\nprint(\n(int(\n(int(eval(input())) + 1)\n/ 2\n)\n)\nCode v2\nnum_input = eval(input())\nnum_input = int(num_input)\nnum_input += 1\nnum_result = int(num_input / 2)\nprint(num_result)\nFigure 12: SELF-REFINE iterations over a piece of densely composed code. Through out the\niterations, the model first try to indent out the code and ends up rewriting it into several lines of\natomic operations.\nchallenging to develop a system that can consistently generate coherent and engaging responses.\nIn this section, we use SELF-REFINE for automatically generated feedback and applying iterative\nrefinement to improve the quality of the responses.\nM.1\nModules\nWe follow the high-level description of the framework from Section 2, and instantiate our framework\nas follows.\nInit\nThis is the first step in performing the task. The init module takes the dialogue context as input\nand generates a response that follows the conversation.\nFeedback\nWe design an FEEDBACK that can provide multifaceted feedback for the quality of the\nresponse generated. Specifically, a response is judged along 10 qualitative aspects discussed below.\nA more thorough review of such fine-grained dialogue quality aspects can be found in Mehri and\nEskenazi (2020). We use 6 in-context examples for feedback generation. In many cases, the feedback\nexplicitly points out the reasons why a response scores low on some qualitative aspect. We show an\nexample in Figure 13.\n\u2022 Relevant Does the response addresses all important aspects of the context?\n\u2022 Informative - Does the response provide some information relevant to the context?\n\u2022 Interesting - Doe the response beyond providing a simple and predictable answer to a\nquestion or statement?\n\u2022 Consistent - Is the response consistent with the rest of the conversation in terms of tone and\ntopic?\n\u2022 Helpful - Is the response helpful in providing any information or suggesting any actions?\n\u2022 Engaging - Is the response engaging and encourage further conversation?\n\u2022 Specific - The response contains specific content related to a topic or question,\n\u2022 Safe - Is the response safe and does not contain any offensive, toxic or harmful content and\ndoes not touch on any sensitive topics or share any personal information?\n\u2022 User understanding - Does the response demonstrate an understanding of the user\u2019s input\nand state of mind?\n\u2022 Fluent Is the response fluent and easy to understand?\n31\n\fContext: Speaker A - What are your hobbies?\nSpeaker B - I really just spend the rest of my free time with those\nthat are close to me.\nSpeaker A - I m very much interested in playing table tennis.\nResponse: That sounds like a lot of fun! I'm not very good at table tennis, but\nI'm sure it's a great way to socialize and stay active.\nFeedback:\n* Relevant: The response is relevant to the user's input and shows interest in\nthe user's hobby. 3/3\n* Informative: The response does not provide any information about table tennis\nor how to play it. 1/3\n* Interesting: The response is not very interesting or intriguing. 1/3\n* Consistent: The response is consistent with the tone and context of the\nconversation. 3/3\n* Helpful: The response is not particularly helpful as it does not provide any\ninformation or suggest any actions. 1/3\n* Engaging: The response is somewhat engaging. It acknowledges the user's\ninterest in table tennis and encourages them to continue playing. 2/3\n* Specific: The response is not specific, as it does not address the topic of\ntable tennis in any particular way. 1/3\n* Safe: The response is safe and does not contain any offensive, toxic or\nharmful content and does not touch on any sensitive topics or share any\npersonal information. 3/3\n* User understanding: The response shows some understanding of the user's input\nand acknowledges their interest in table tennis. 2/3\n* Fluent: The response is fluent in terms of grammar and flow of words. 3/3\n* Total score: 20/30\nNew Response: Table tennis is a great hobby! It's a great way to stay active\nand socialize with others. Have you ever tried it before? If not, I'd suggest\nstarting with some beginner tutorials on Youtube. They are really helpful in\ngetting a good grasp of the basics.\nFigure 13: SELF-REFINE prompts for dialogue response generation: INIT generates a first draft of\nthe response generated in a few-shot manner. FEEDBACK contains demonstrations of responses and\nnatural language feedback on several qualitative aspects of the response. REFINE takes the response\nand the feedback and refines it to match the feedback better.\nIterate\nThe iterate module takes a sequence of dialogue context, prior generated responses, and\nthe feedback and refines the output to match the feedback better. An example of a context, response,\nfeedback and a refined response is shown in Figure 13.\nM.2\nSetup and Experiments\nModel and Baseline\nWe establish a natural baseline for our approach by using the model directly,\nwithout any feedback, which we refer to as INIT. Our implementation of SELF-REFINE employs a\nfew-shot setup, where each module (INIT, FEEDBACK, ITERATE) is implemented as few-shot prompts,\nand we execute the self-improvement loop for a maximum k = 3 iterations. We provide 3 few-shot\nin-context examples for the INIT model, and instruct the model to produce a response that is good\nat the 10 aspects listed above. As in-context examples for FEEDBACK, we use the same 3 contexts\nand responses shown to the INIT model (including low-scoring variations of those responses), along\nwith scores and explanations for each feedback aspect. The ITERATE model is also shown the same\nin-context examples, and it consists of contexts-response-feedback followed by a better version of\nthe response. For SELF-REFINE, we chose the response that gets the highest total score from the\nFEEDBACK model across all iterations excluding the initial response. We use text-davinci-003\nfor all the experiments.\n32\n\fGPT-3.5\nChatGPT\nGPT4\nSELF-REFINE wins\n36.0\n48.0\n54.0\nINIT wins\n23.0\n18.0\n16.0\nBoth are equal\n41.0\n50.0\n30.0\nTable 15: Human evaluation results for dialogue response generation\nEvaluation\nWe perform experiments on the FED dataset (Mehri and Eskenazi, 2020). The FED\ndataset is a collection of human-system and human-human conversations annotated with eighteen\nfine-grained dialog qualities at both the turn and the dialogue-level. The dataset was created to\nevaluate interactive dialog systems without relying on reference responses or training data. We\nevaluate the quality of the generated outputs using both automated and human evaluation methods.\nFor automatic evaluation in Table1, we used zero-shot prompting with text-davinci-003 and\nevaluate on a test set of 342 instances. We show the model the responses generated by SELF-REFINE\nand the baseline INIT and ask the model to select the better response in terms of the 10 qualities. We\nreport the win rate. However, we acknowledge that automated metrics may not provide an accurate\nassessment of text generation tasks and rely on human evaluation instead.\nGiven a dialogue context with a varying number of turns, we generate outputs from the above\nmentioned methods. For human evaluation, for 100 randomly selected test instances, we show\nannotators the 10 response quality aspects, responses from SELF-REFINE and INIT models and ask\nthem to select the better response. They are also given the option to select \u201cboth\u201d when it is hard to\nshow preference toward one response.\nResults\nAutomatic evaluation results are shown in Table1 and human evaluation results are are\nshown in Table 15. We experiment on 3 latest versions of GPT models. text-davinci-003 is\ncapable of generating human-like responses of great quality for a wide range of dialogue contexts\nand hence GPT-3.5 is a strong baseline. Still, SELF-REFINE beats INIT by a wide margin on both\nautomatic as well as human evaluation. Our manual analysis shows that outputs generated by SELFREFINE are more engaging and interesting and generally more elaborate than the outputs generated\nby INIT.\nN\nCode Optimization\nPerformance-Improving Code Edits or PIE (Madaan et al., 2023) focuses on enhancing the efficiency\nof functionally correct programs. The primary objective of PIE is to optimize a given program by\nimplementing algorithmic modifications that lead to improved runtime performance.\nGiven an optimization generated by PIE, SELF-REFINE first generates a natural language feedback\non possible improvements Figure 20. Then, the feedback is fed to REFINE Figure 21 for refinement.\nTable 16: Main Results and Ablation Analysis\nSetup\nIteration\n% Optimized\nRelative Speedup\nSpeedup\nDirect\n-9.7\n62.29\n3.09\nSELF-REFINE \u2212 feedback\n1\n10.1\n62.15\n3.03\nSELF-REFINE \u2212 feedback\n2\n10.4\n61.79\n3.01\nSELF-REFINE\n1\n15.3\n59.64\n2.90\nSELF-REFINE\n2\n15.6\n65.60\n3.74\nTable 17: Performance comparison of SELF-REFINE and ablated variants for code optimization. The\ntable highlights the effectiveness of SELF-REFINE in optimizing code through iterative feedback and\nimprovement, outperforming both the direct method and the simplified feedback approach, which\nlacks the introspective feedback mechanism of SELF-REFINE. This demonstrates the value of our\nframework\u2019s multi-faceted feedback in refining the generated code.\n33\n\fO\nMath Reasoning\nWe use the Grade School Math 8k (GSM-8k) dataset (Cobbe et al., 2021) for evaluating SELF-REFINE\non math reasoning. In the context of grade school mathematics, SELF-REFINE aims to enable LLMs\nto iteratively refine their mathematical problem-solving outputs based on introspective feedback.\nFollowing Gao et al. (2022), we write solutions to the reasoning problems in Python. Consider the\nfollowing example from the paper, where an error in the code demonstrates a lack of understanding\nof the problem:\ndef solution():\n\"\"\"Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of\nhalf a dozen plates sold at $6000 each.\nCalculate the total cost of buying each cup.\"\"\"\nplates = 6\nplate_cost = 6000\ncups = 12 * 20\ncup_cost = plate_cost\nresult = cup_cost\nreturn result\nBy using SELF-REFINE, we can identify the error in the code and refine the solution through an\niterative process of introspection and feedback:\n# Let's go through the error and check step-by-step\nplates = 6\nplate_cost = 6000\n# Let's check the other parts\ncups = 12 * 20\ncup_cost = plate_cost\n# wrong! The cost of a cup is not the same as the\ncost of a plate.\n\ufffd\u2192\n# The cost of a cup is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen\nplates sold at $6000 each.\n\ufffd\u2192\nhalf_dozen_plate_cost = 6 * plate_cost\ncup_cost = half_dozen_plate_cost - 1200\nSELF-REFINE is thus instantiated naturally: the generator generates an initial solution, and FEEDBACK\nscans the solution to spot errors on which to provide feedback. The feedback is supplied to REFINE to\ncreate a new solution. Following Welleck et al. (2022), we use the correct label to decide when to go\nfrom one point in the loop to the next. This label feedback can be used to decide when to go from\none point in the iteration to the next.

While a large body of work on style transfer is directed at\nsentence-level sentiment transfer (Li et al., 2018; Prabhumoye et al., 2018), we focus on transferring\nthe sentiment of entire reviews, making the task challenging and providing opportunities for iterative\nimprovements.\nInstantiating SELF-REFINE for sentiment reversal\nWe instantiate SELF-REFINE for this task\nfollowing the high-level description of the framework shared in Section 2. Recall that our requires\nthree components: INIT to generate an initial output, FEEDBACK to generate feedback on the initial\noutput, and REFINE for improving the output based on the feedback.\nSELF-REFINE is implemented in a complete few-shot setup, where each module (INIT, FEEDBACK,\nITERATE) is implemented as few-shot prompts. We execute the self-improvement loop for a maximum\nof k = 4 iterations. The iterations continue until the target sentiment is reached.\nP.1\nDetails\nEvaluation\nGiven an input and a desired sentiment level, we generate outputs SELF-REFINE and\nthe baselines. Then, we measure the % of times output from each setup was preferred to better align\nwith the desired sentiment level (see Section 2 for more details).\nWe also experiment with standard text-classification metric. That is, given a transferred review, we\nuse an off-the-shelf text-classifier (Vader) to judge its sentiment level. We find that all methods\nwere successful in generating an output that aligns with the target sentiment. For instance, when the\ntarget sentiment was positive, both GPT-3.5 with text-davinci-003 and SELF-REFINE generates\nsentences that have a positive sentiment (100% classification accuracy). With the negative target\nsentiment, the classification scores were 92% for GPT-3.5 and 93.6% for SELF-REFINE.\nWe conduct automated and human evaluation for measuring the preference rates for adhering to\nthe desired sentiment, and how dramatic the generations are. For automated evaluation, we create\nfew-shot examples for evaluating which of the two reviews is more positive and less boring. We use a\nseparate prompt for each task. The examples are depicted in Figure 33 for initialization, Figure 34\nfor feedback generation, and Figure 35 for refinement. The prompts show examples of reviews of\nvarying degrees of sentiment and colorfulness (more colorful reviews use extreme phrases \u2014 the\n35\n\ffood was really bad vs. I wouldn\u2019t eat it if they pay me.). The model is then required to select one of\nthe outputs as being more aligned with the sentiment and having a more exciting language. We report\nthe preference rates: the % of times a variant was preferred by the model over the outputs generated\nby SELF-REFINE.\nPin-pointed feedback\nA key contribution of our method is supplying chain-of-thought prompting\nstyle feedback. That is, the feedback not only indicates that the target sentiment has not reached,\nbut further points out phrases and words in the review that should be altered to reach the desired\nsentiment level. We experiment with an ablation of our setup where the feedback module simply\nsays \u201csomething is wrong.\u201d In such cases, for sentiment evaluation, the output from SELF-REFINE\nwere preferred 73% of the time (down from 85% with informative feedback). For dramatic response\nevaluation, we found that the preference rate went down drastically to 58.92%, from 80.09%. These\nresults clearly indicate the importance of pin-pointed feedback.\nEvaluation\nWe evaluate the task using GPT-4. Specifically, we use the following prompt:\nWhen both win, we add winning rate to either.\nQ\nAcronym Generation\nGood acronyms provide a concise and memorable way to communicate complex ideas, making them\neasier to understand and remember, ultimately leading to more efficient and effective communication.\nLike in email writing, acronym generation also requires an iterative refinement process to achieve a\nconcise and memorable representation of a complex term or phrase. Acronyms often involve tradeoffs\nbetween length, ease of pronunciation, and relevance to the original term or phrase. Thus, acronym\ngeneration is a natural method testbed for our approach.\nWe\nsource\nthe\ndataset\nfor\nthis\ntask\nfrom\nhttps://github.com/krishnakt031990/\nCrawl-Wiki-For-Acronyms/blob/master/AcronymsFile.csv, and prune the file manually\nto remove potentially offensive or completely uninformative acronyms. This exercise generated a list\nof 250 acronyms. The complete list is given in our code repository.\nFEEDBACK\nFor feedback, we design an FEEDBACK that can provide multifaceted feedback. Specifically, each acronym is judged along five dimensions:\n\u2022 Ease of pronunciation: How easy or difficult is it to pronounce the acronym? Are there\nany difficult or awkward sounds or combinations of letters that could make it challenging to\nsay out loud?\n\u2022 Ease of spelling: How easy or difficult is it to spell the acronym? Are there any unusual or\nuncommon letter combinations that could make it tricky to write or remember?\n\u2022 Relation to title: How closely does the acronym reflect the content or topic of the associated\ntitle, phrase, or concept? Is the acronym clearly related to the original term or does it seem\nunrelated or random?\n\u2022 Positive connotation: Does the acronym have any positive or negative associations or\nconnotations? Does it sound upbeat, neutral, or negative in tone or meaning?\n\u2022 Well-known: How familiar or recognizable is the acronym to the target audience? Is it a\ncommon or widely-used term, or is it obscure or unfamiliar?\nSome of these criteria are difficult to quantify, and are a matter of human preference. As with other\nmodules, we leverage the superior instruction following capabilities of modern LLMs to instead\nprovide a few demonstrations of each task. Crucially, the feedback includes a chain of thought\nstyle reasoning \u2014 before generating the score for an acronym for a specific criteria, we generate a\nreasoning chain explicitly stating the reason for the scores. We use human evaluation to judge the\nfinal quality of the acronyms. An example of generated acronyms and associated feedback is given in\nTable 18.\n36\n\fCriteria\noutput from GPT3: STSLWN\noutput from SELF-REFINE: Seq2Seq\nEase of pronunciation\nPronounced as ess-tee-ess-ell-doubleyou-enn which is very difficult.\nPronounced as seq-two-seq which is easy.\nEase of spelling\nVery difficult to spell.\nEasy to spell.\nRelation to title\nNo relation to the title.\nMentions sequence which is somewhat related\nto the title.\nPositive connotation\nMeaningless acronym.\nPositive connotation giving a sense of ease\nwith which the learning algorithm can be used.\nWell-known\nNot a well-known acronym.\nClose to the word sequence which is a wellknown word.\nTotal score\n5/25\n20/25\nTable 18: Comparison of acronyms for input = \u201cSequence to Sequence Learning with Neural\nNetworks\u201d\nR\nConstrained Generation\nIn this work, we introduce a more challenging variant of the CommonGen task, dubbed \u201cCommonGenHard,\u201d designed to push the boundaries of state-of-the-art language models. CommonGen-Hard\nrequires models to generate coherent and grammatically correct sentences incorporating 20-30\nconcepts, as opposed to the original task which presents a set of 3-5 related concepts. This significant\nincrease in the number of concepts tests the model\u2019s ability to perform advanced commonsense\nreasoning, contextual understanding, and creative problem-solving, as it must generate meaningful\nsentences that encompass a broader range of ideas. This new dataset serves as a valuable benchmark\nfor the continuous improvement of large language models and their potential applications in complex,\nreal-world scenarios.\nThe increased complexity of the CommonGen-Hard task makes it an ideal testbed for evaluating\nthe effectiveness of our proposed framework, SELF-REFINE, which focuses on iterative creation\nwith introspective feedback. Given that initial outputs from language models may not always meet\nthe desired level of quality, coherence, or sensibility, applying SELF-REFINE enables the models to\nprovide multi-dimensional feedback on their own generated output and subsequently refine it based on\nthe introspective feedback provided. Through iterative creation and self-reflection, the SELF-REFINE\nframework empowers language models to progressively enhance the quality of their output, closely\nmimicking the human creative process and demonstrating its ability to improve generated text on\ncomplex and demanding natural language generation tasks like CommonGen-Hard (Figure 15).\nS\nPrompts\nWe include all the prompts used in the experiments in Figures 16-35:\n\u2022 Acronym Generation: Figures 16-18\n\u2022 Code Optimization: Figures 19-21\n\u2022 Code Readability Improvement: Figures 22-23\n\u2022 Constrained Generation: Figures 24-26\n\u2022 Dialogue Response Generation: Figures 27-29\n\u2022 Math Reasoning: Figures 30-32\n\u2022 Sentiment Reversal: Figures 33-35\nRecall that the Base LLM requires a generation prompt pgen with input-output pairs \u27e8xi, yi\u27e9, the\nfeedback module requires a feedback prompt pfb with input-output-feedback triples \u27e8xi, yi, fbi\u27e9, and\nthe refinement module (REFINE) requires a refinement prompt prefine with input-output-feedbackrefined quadruples \u27e8xi, yi, fbi, yi+1\u27e9.\n\u2022 Sentiment Reversal We create positive and negative variants of a single review from the\ntraining set and manually write a description for converting the negative variant to positive\n37\n\fConcept\nCommonsense\nOverall\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n3\n5\n0\n35\n10\n32\nWinning Ratio\nDirect\nSELF-REFINE\nFigure 15: A comparison of SELF-REFINE and direct generation with GPT-3.5 on CommonGenHard.\nand vice versa.

Motivated by how humans refine their written text, we introduce Self-Refine, an approach for improving initial outputs from LLMs through iterative feedback and refinement. The main idea is to generate an initial output using an LLM; then, the same LLM provides _feedback_ for its output and uses it to _refine_ itself, iteratively. Self-Refine does not require any supervised training data, additional training, or reinforcement learning, and instead uses a single LLM as the generator, refiner and the feedback provider. We evaluate Self-Refine across 7 diverse tasks, ranging from dialog response generation to mathematical reasoning, using state-of-the-art (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) LLMs. Across all evaluated tasks, outputs generated with Self-Refine are preferred by humans and automatic metrics over those generated with the same LLM using conventional one-step generation, improving by \\(\\sim\\)20% absolute on average in task performance. Our work demonstrates that even state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4 can be further improved at test-time using our simple, standalone approach.1.\n\nFootnote 1: Code and data at [https://selfrefine.info/](https://selfrefine.info/)\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nAlthough large language models (LLMs) can generate coherent outputs, they often fall short in addressing intricate requirements. This mostly includes tasks with multifaceted objectives, such as dialogue response generation, or tasks with hard-to-define goals, such as enhancing program readability. In these scenarios, modern LLMs may produce an intelligible initial output, yet may benefit from further iterative refinement--i.e., iteratively mapping a candidate output to an improved one--to ensure that the desired quality is achieved. Iterative refinement typically involves training a refinement model that relies on domain-specific data (e.g., Reid and Neubig (2022); Schick et al. (2022); Welleck et al. (2022)). Other approaches that rely on external supervision or reward models require large training sets or expensive human annotations (Madaan et al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2022), which may not always be feasible to obtain. These limitations underscore the need for an effective refinement approach that can be applied to various tasks without requiring extensive supervision.\n\nIterative _self_-refinement is a fundamental characteristic of human problem-solving (Simon, 1962; Flower and Hayes, 1981; Amabile, 1983). Iterative self-refinement is a process that involves creating an initial draft and subsequently refining it based on self-provided feedback. For example, whendrafting an email to request a document from a colleague, an individual may initially write a direct request such as \"_Send me the data ASAP_\". Upon reflection, however, the writer recognizes the potential impoliteness of the phrasing and revises it to \"_Hi Ashley, could you please send me the data at your earliest convenience?_\". When writing code, a programmer may implement an initial \"quick and dirty\" implementation, and then, upon reflection, refactor their code to a solution that is more efficient and readable. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs can provide iterative self-refinement without additional training, leading to higher-quality outputs on a wide range of tasks.\n\nWe present Self-Refine: an iterative self-refinement algorithm that alternates between two generative steps-feedback and refine. These steps work in tandem to generate high-quality outputs. Given an initial output generated by a model \\(\\mathcal{M}\\), we pass it back to the same model \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) to get _feedback_. Then, the feedback is passed back to the same model to _refine_ the previously-generated draft. This process is repeated either for a specified number of iterations or until \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) determines that no further refinement is necessary. We use few-shot prompting (Brown et al., 2020) to guide \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) to both generate feedback and incorporate the feedback into an improved draft. Figure 1 illustrates the high-level idea, that Self-Refine _uses the same underlying language model to generate feedback and refine its outputs_.\n\nWe evaluate Self-Refine on 7 generation tasks that span diverse domains, including natural language and source-code generation. We show that Self-Refine outperforms direct generation from strong LLMs like GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003 and gpt-3.5-turbo; OpenAI; Ouyang et al., 2022) and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) by 5-40% absolute improvement. In code-generation tasks, Self-Refine improves the initial generation by up to absolute 13% when applied to strong code models such as Codex (code-davinci-002; Chen et al., 2021). We release all of our code, which is easily extensible to other LLMs. In essence, our results show that even when an LLM cannot generate an optimal output on its first try, the LLM can often provide useful feedback and improve its own output accordingly. In turn, Self-Refine provides an effective way to obtain better outputs from a single model without any additional training, via iterative (self-)feedback and refinement.\n\n## 2 Iterative Refinement with Self-Refine\n\nGiven an input sequence, Self-Refine generates an initial output, provides feedback on the output, and refines the output according to the feedback. Self-Refine iterates between feedback and refinement until a desired condition is met. Self-Refine relies on a suitable language model and three prompts (for initial generation, feedback, and refinement), and does not require training. Self-Refine is shown in Figure 1 and Algorithm 1. Next, we describe Self-Refine in more detail.\n\nInitial generationGiven an input \\(x\\), prompt \\(p_{\\text{gen}}\\), and model \\(\\mathcal{M}\\), Self-Refine generates an initial output \\(y_{0}\\):\n\n\\[y_{0}=\\mathcal{M}\\left(p_{\\text{gen}}\\|x\\right). \\tag{1}\\]\n\nFigure 1: Given an input (\u20ddraisebox), Self-Refine starts by generating an output and passing it back to the same model \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) to get feedback (\u20ddraisebox). The feedback is passed back to \\(\\mathcal{M}\\), which refines the previously generated output (\u20ddraisebox). Steps (\u20ddraisebox) and (\u20ddraisebox) iterate until a stopping condition is met. Self-Refine is instantiated with a language model such as GPT-3.5 and does not involve human assistance.\n\nFor example, in Figure 2(d), the model generates functionally correct code for the given input. Here, \\(p_{\\text{gen}}\\) is a task-specific few-shot prompt (or instruction) for an initial generation, and \\(\\|\\) denotes concatenation. The few-shot prompt contains input-output pairs \\(\\langle x^{(k)},y^{(k)}\\rangle\\) for the task.2\n\nFootnote 2: Few-shot prompting (also referred to as \u201cin-context learning\u201d) provides a model with a prompt consisting of \\(k\\) in-context examples of the target task, each in the form of input-output pairs \\(\\langle x_{i},y_{i}\\rangle\\) (Brown et al., 2020).\n\nfeedbackNext, Self-Refine uses the same model \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) to provide feedback \\(fb_{t}\\) on its own output, given a task-specific prompt \\(p_{\\text{fb}}\\) for generating feedback:\n\n\\[fb_{t}=\\mathcal{M}\\left(p_{\\text{fb}}\\|x\\|y_{t}\\right). \\tag{2}\\]\n\nIntuitively, the feedback may address multiple aspects of the output. For example, in code optimization, the feedback might address the efficiency, readability, and overall quality of the code.\n\nFigure 3: The Self-Refine algorithm. See (\u00a72) for a discussion of each component.\n\nFigure 2: Examples of Self-Refine: an initial output generated by the base LLM and then passed back to the _same_ LLM to receive feedback to the _same_ LLM to refine the output. The top row illustrates this for dialog generation where an initial dialogue response can be transformed into a more engaging one that also understands the user by applying feedback. The bottom row illustrates this for code optimization where the code is made more efficient by applying feedback.\n\nHere, the prompt \\(p_{\\text{fb}}\\) provides examples of feedback in the form of input-output-feedback triples \\(\\langle x^{(k)},y^{(k)},fb^{(k)}\\rangle\\). We prompt the model to write feedback that is actionable and specific via \\(fb^{(k)}\\). By 'actionable', we mean the feedback should contain a concrete action that would likely improve the output. By'specific', we mean the feedback should identify concrete phrases in the output to change. For example, the feedback in Figure 2(e) is \"_This code is slow as it uses a for loop which is brute force. A better approach is to use the formula... (n(n+1))/2_\". This feedback is actionable, since it suggests the action 'use the formula...'. The feedback is specific since it mentions the 'for loop'.\n\nrefineNext, Self-Refine uses \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) to refine its most recent output, given its own feedback:\n\n\\[y_{t+1}=\\mathcal{M}\\left(p_{\\text{refine}}\\|x\\|y_{t}\\|fb_{t}\\right). \\tag{3}\\]\n\nFor example, in Figure 2(f), given the initial output and the generated feedback, the model generates a re-implementation that is shorter and runs much faster than the initial implementation. The prompt \\(p_{\\text{refine}}\\) provides examples of improving the output based on the feedback, in the form of input-output-feedback-refined quadruples \\(\\langle x^{(k)},y^{(k)}_{t},fb^{(k)}_{t},y^{(k)}_{t+1}\\rangle\\).\n\nIterating Self-RefineSelf-Refine alternates between feedback and refine steps until a stopping condition is met. The stopping condition \\(\\operatorname{stop}(fb_{t},t)\\) either stops at a specified timestep \\(t\\), or extracts a stopping indicator (e.g. a scalar stop score) from the feedback. In practice, the model can be prompted to generate a stopping indicator in \\(p_{\\text{fb}}\\), and the condition is determined per-task.\n\nTo inform the model about the previous iterations, we retain the history of previous feedback and outputs by appending them to the prompt. Intuitively, this allows the model to learn from past mistakes and avoid repeating them. More precisely, Equation (3) is in fact instantiated as:\n\n\\[y_{t+1}=\\mathcal{M}\\left(p_{\\text{refine}}\\|x\\|y_{0}\\|fb_{0}\\|...\\|y_{t}\\|fb_{t }\\right). \\tag{4}\\]\n\nFinally, we use the last refinement \\(y_{t}\\) as the output of Self-Refine.\n\nAlgorithm 1 summarizes Self-Refine, and Figure 2 shows an example of Self-Refine in the Dialogue Response Generation (Mehri and Eskenazi, 2020) and Code Optimization (Madaan et al., 2023) tasks. Appendix S provides examples of the \\(p_{\\text{gen}}\\), \\(p_{\\text{fb}}\\), \\(p_{\\text{refine}}\\) prompts for various tasks. The key idea is that Self-Refine uses the same underlying LLM to generate, get feedback, and refine its outputs given its own feedback. It relies only on supervision present in the few-shot examples.\n\n## 3 Evaluation\n\nWe evaluate Self-Refine on 7 diverse tasks: Dialogue Response Generation (Appendix M; Mehri and Eskenazi, 2020), Code Optimization (Appendix N; Madaan et al., 2023), Code Readability Improvement (Appendix L; Puri et al., 2021), Math Reasoning (Appendix O; Cobbe et al., 2021), Sentiment Reversal (Appendix P; Zhang et al., 2015), and we introduce two new tasks: Aeronym Generation (Appendix Q) and Constrained Generation (a harder version of Lin et al. (2020) with 20-30 keyword constraints instead of 3-5; Appendix R)\n\nExamples for all tasks and dataset statistics are provided in Table 4 (Appendix A).\n\n### Instantiating Self-Refine\n\nWe instantiate Self-Refine following the high-level description in Section 2. The feedback-refine iterations continue until the desired output quality or task-specific criterion is reached, up to a maximum of 4 iterations. To make our evaluation consistent across different models, we implemented both feedback and refine as few-shot prompts even with models that respond well to instructions, such as ChatGPT and GPT-4.\n\nBase LLMsOur main goal is to evaluate whether we can improve the performance of any strong base LLMs using Self-Refine. Therefore, we compare Self-Refine to the same base LLMs but without feedback-refine iterations. We used three main strong base LLM across all tasks: GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003), ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo), and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023). For code-based tasks, we also experimented with Codex (code-davinci-002). In all tasks, either GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 is the previous state-of-the-art.3 We used the same prompts from previous work when available (such as for Code Optimization and Math Reasoning); otherwise, we created prompts as detailed in Appendix S. We use greedy decoding with a temperature of 0.7 for all setups.\n\n### Metrics\n\nWe report three types of metrics:\n\n* Task specific metric: When available, we use automated metrics from prior work (Math Reasoning: % solve rate; Code Optimization: % programs optimized; Constrained Gen: coverage %)\n* Human-pref: In Dialogue Response Generation, Code Readability Improvement, Sentiment Reversal, and Acronym Generation, since no automated metrics are available, we perform a blind human A/B evaluation on a subset of the outputs to select the preferred output. Additional details are provided in Appendix C.\n* GPT-4-pref: In addition to human-pref, we use GPT-4 as a proxy for human preference following prior work (Fu et al., 2023; Chiang et al., 2023; Geng et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023), and found high correlation (82% for Sentiment Reversal, 68% for Acronym Generation, and 71% for Dialogue Response Generation) with human-pref. For Code Readability Improvement, we prompt GPT-4 to calculate fraction of the variables that are appropriately named given the context (e.g., x = [] \\(\\rightarrow\\) input_buffer = []). Additional details are provided in Appendix D.\n\n### Results\n\nTable 1 shows our main results:\n\n**Self-Refine consistently improves over base models** across all model sizes, and additionally outperforms the previous state-of-the-art across all tasks. For example, GPT-4+Self-Refine improves over the base GPT-4 by 8.7% (absolute) in Code Optimization, increasing optimization percentage from 27.3% to 36.0%. Confidence intervals are provided in Appendix J. For code-based tasks, we found similar trends when using Codex; those results are included in Appendix F.\n\nOne of the tasks in which we observe the highest gains compared to the base models is Constrained Generation, where the model is asked to generate a sentence containing up to 30 given concepts. We believe that this task benefits significantly from Self-Refine because there are more opportunities to miss some of the concepts on the first attempt, and thus Self-Refine allows the model to fix these mistakes subsequently. Further, this task has an extremely large number of reasonable outputs, and thus Self-Refine allows to better explore the space of possible outputs.\n\nIn preference-based tasks such as Dialogue Response Generation, Sentiment Reversal, and Acronym Generation, Self-Refine leads to especially high gains. For example in Dialogue Response Generation, GPT-4 preference score improve by 49.2% - from 25.4% to 74.6%. Similarly, we see remarkable improvements in the other preference-based tasks across all models.\n\nThe modest performance gains in Math Reasoning can be traced back to the inability to accurately identify whether there is any error. In math, errors can be nuanced and sometimes limited to a single line or incorrect operation. Besides, a consistent-looking reasoning chain can deceive LLMs to\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l r r r r r} \\hline \\hline  & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{GPT-3.5} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{ChatGPT} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{GPT-4} \\\\ \\cline{2-6} Task & Base & +Self-Refine & Base & +Self-Refine & Base & +Self-Refine \\\\ \\hline Sentiment Reversal & 8.8 & **30.4** (\\(\\uparrow\\)21.6) & 11.4 & **43.2** (\\(\\uparrow\\)31.8) & 3.8 & **36.2** (\\(\\uparrow\\)32.4) \\\\ Dialogue Response & 36.4 & **63.6** (\\(\\uparrow\\)27.2) & 40.1 & **59.9** (\\(\\uparrow\\)19.8) & 25.4 & **74.6** (\\(\\uparrow\\)49.2) \\\\ Code Optimization & 14.8 & **23.0** (\\(\\uparrow\\)8.2) & 23.9 & **27.5** (\\(\\uparrow\\)36.0) & 27.3 & **36.0** (\\(\\uparrow\\)8.7) \\\\ Code Readability & 37.4 & **51.3** (\\(\\uparrow\\)13.9) & 27.7 & **63.1** (\\(\\uparrow\\)35.4) & 27.4 & **56.2** (\\(\\uparrow\\)28.8) \\\\ Math Reasoning & **64.1** & **64.1** (0) & 74.8 & **75.0** (\\(\\uparrow\\)0.2) & 92.9 & **93.1** (\\(\\uparrow\\)0.2) \\\\ Acronym Generation & 41.6 & **56.4** (\\(\\uparrow\\)14.8) & 27.2 & **37.2** (\\(\\uparrow\\)10.0) & 30.4 & **56.0** (\\(\\uparrow\\)25.6) \\\\ Constrained Generation & 28.0 & **37.0** (\\(\\uparrow\\)9.0) & 44.0 & **67.0** (\\(\\uparrow\\)23.0) & 15.0 & **45.0** (\\(\\uparrow\\)30.0) \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: Self-Refine results on various tasks using GPT-3.5, ChatGPT, and GPT-4 as base LLM. Self-Refine consistently improves LLM. Metrics used for these tasks are defined in Section 3.2.\n\nthink that \"everything looks good\" (e.g., ChatGPT feedback for 94% instances is 'everything looks good'). In Appendix H.1, we show that the gains with Self-Refine on Math Reasoning are much bigger (5%+) if an external source can identify if the current math answer is incorrect.\n\n**Improvement is consistent across base LLMs sizes** Generally, GPT-4+Self-Refine performs better than GPT-3.5+Self-Refine and ChatGPT+Self-Refine across all tasks, even in tasks where the initial base results of GPT-4 were lower than GPT-3.5 or ChatGPT. We thus believe that Self-Refine allows stronger models (such as GPT-4) to unlock their full potential, even in cases where this potential is not expressed in the standard, single-pass, output generation. Comparison to additional strong baselines is provided in Appendix F.\n\n## 4 Analysis\n\nThe three main steps of Self-Refine are feedback, refine, and repeating them iteratively. In this section, we perform additional experiments to analyze the importance of each of these steps.\n\nThe impact of the feedback qualityFeedback quality plays a crucial role in Self-Refine. To quantify its impact, we compare Self-Refine, which utilizes specific, actionable feedback, with two ablations: one using generic feedback and another without feedback (the model may still iteratively refine its generations, but is not explicitly provided feedback to do so). For example, in the Code Optimization task: actionable feedback, such as _Avoid repeated calculations in the for loop_, pinpoints an issue and suggests a clear improvement. Generic feedback, like _Improve the efficiency of the code_, lacks this precision and direction. Table 2 shows feedback's clear influence.\n\nIn Code Optimization, performance slightly dips from 27.5 (Self-Refine feedback) to 26.0 (generic feedback), and further to 24.8 (no feedback). This suggests that while generic feedback offers some guidance - specific, actionable feedback yields superior results.\n\nThis effect is more pronounced in tasks like Sentiment Transfer, where changing from our feedback to generic feedback leads to a significant performance drop (43.2 to 31.2), and the task fails without feedback. Similarly, in Acronym Generation, without actionable feedback, performance drops from 56.4 to 48.0, even with iterative refinements. These results highlight the importance of specific, actionable feedback in our approach. Even generic feedback provides some benefit, but the best results are achieved with targeted, constructive feedback.\n\nHow important are the multiple iterations of feedback-refine?Figure 4 demonstrates that on average, the quality of the output improves as the number of iterations increases. For instance, in the Code Optimization task, the initial output (\\(y_{0}\\)) has a score of 22.0, which improves to 28.8 after three iterations (\\(y_{3}\\)). Similarly, in the Sentiment Reversal task, the initial output has a score of 33.9, which increases to 36.8 after three iterations. This trend of improvement is also evident in Constrained Generation, where the score increases from 29.0 to 49.7 after three iterations. Figure 4 highlights the diminishing returns in the improvement as the number of iterations increases. Overall, having multiple feedback-refine iterations significantly enhances the quality of the output, although the marginal improvement naturally decreases with more iterations.\n\nThe performance may not always monotonically increase with iterations: in multi-aspect feedback tasks like Acronym Generation, where the output quality can vary during iteration with improvement in one aspect but decline in another aspect. To counter this, Self-Refine generates numerical scores for different quality aspects, leading to a balanced evaluation and appropriate output selection.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \\hline \\hline Task & Self-Refine feedback & Generic feedback & No feedback \\\\ \\hline Code Optimization & **27.5** & 26.0 & 24.8 \\\\ Sentiment Reversal & **43.2** & 31.2 & 0 \\\\ Acronym Generation & **56.4** & 54.0 & 48.0 \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 2: Prompting to generate generic feedback (or having the model generate no feedback at all) leads to reduced scores, indicating the importance of the feedback step of Self-Refine. These experiments were performed with ChatGPT (Code Optimization and Sentiment Reversal) and GPT-3.5 (Acronym Generation), and metrics used are defined in Section 3.2.\n\n**Can we just generate multiple outputs instead of refining?** Does Self-Refine improve because of the iterative refinement, or just because it generates _more_ outputs? We compare Self-Refine with ChatGPT, when ChatGPT generates \\(k=4\\) samples (but without feedback and refinement). Then, we compare the performance of Self-Refine against these \\(k\\) initial outputs in a 1 vs. \\(k\\) evaluation. In other words, we assess whether Self-Refine can outperform _all_\\(k\\) initial outputs. The results of this experiment are illustrated in Figure 6 (Appendix H). Despite the increased difficulty of the 1 vs. \\(k\\) setting, the outputs of Self-Refine are still preferred by humans over _all_\\(k\\) initial outputs. This shows the importance of refinement according to feedback over the alternative of just generating multiple initial outputs.\n\nDoes Self-Refine work with weaker models?The experiments in Section 3.3 were performed with some of the strongest available models; does Self-Refine work with smaller or weaker models as well? To investigate this, we instantiated Self-Refine with Vicuna-13B (Chiang et al., 2023), a\n\nFigure 4: **Left: Iteration-wise score improvements. Early iterations significantly improve output quality, and scores generally keep improving with more iterations. Right: Self-Refine Performance improvements with iterations. Most gains(\\(\\Delta\\)) are in the initial iterations for both Code Opt. and Sentiment Reversal. The numbers are averaged over ChatGPT, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. Task abbreviations: C. Opt. (Code Optimiz.), S. Rev. (Sentiment Reversal), C. Gen. (Constrained Generation).**\n\nFigure 5: Comparison of code generated by Madaan et al. (2023) (left) and the output after applying Self-Refine (right). The initial code by the baseline, which is nearly identical to the slower input program, fails to improve the efficiency and merely alters the logic for reading input. Self-Refine first generates feedback that diagnoses that _This code is slow because it is using six nested loops to iterate through all possible combinations of coins to pay the amount,_ and suggests that _a more efficient approach would be..._. Self-Refine then uses this feedback to generate the revised code (right), reducing the time complexity to \\(\\mathcal{O}(amount*coins)\\). The full example is provided in Appendix Hless powerful base model. While Vicuna-13B is capable of generating initial outputs, it struggles significantly with the refinement process. Specifically, Vicuna-13B was not able to consistently generate the feedback in the required format. Furthermore, even when provided with Oracle or hard-coded feedback, it often failed to adhere to the prompts for refinement. Instead of refining its output, Vicuna-13B either repeated the same output or generated a hallucinated conversation, rendering the outputs less effective. We thus hypothesize that since Vicuna-13B was trained on conversations, it does not generalize as well as instruction-based models to test-time few-shot tasks. Example output and analysis is provided in Appendix G.\n\nQualitative AnalysisWe conduct a qualitative analysis of the feedback generated by Self-Refine and its subsequent refinements. We manually analyze 70 samples in total (35 success cases and 35 failure cases) for Code Optimization (Madaan et al., 2023) and Math Reasoning (Cobbe et al., 2021). For both Math Reasoning and Code Optimization, we found that the feedback was predominantly actionable, with the majority identifying problematic aspects of the original generation and suggesting ways to rectify them.\n\nWhen Self-Refine failed to improve the original generation, the majority of issues were due to erroneous feedback rather than faulty refinements. Specifically, 33% of unsuccessful cases were due to feedback inaccurately pinpointing the error's location, while 61% were a result of feedback suggesting an inappropriate fix. Only 6% of failures were due to the refiner incorrectly implementing good feedback. These observations highlight the vital role of accurate feedback plays in Self-Refine.\n\nIn successful cases, the refiner was guided by accurate and useful feedback to make precise fixes to the original generation in 61% of the cases. Interestingly, the refiner was capable of rectifying issues even when the feedback was partially incorrect, which was the situation in 33% of successful cases. This suggests resilience to sub-optimal feedback. Future research could focus on examining the refiner's robustness to various types of feedback errors and exploring ways to enhance this resilience. In Figure 5, we illustrate how Self-Refine significantly improves program efficiency by transforming a brute force approach into a dynamic programming solution, as a result of insightful feedback. Additional analysis on other datasets such as Dialogue Response Generation is provided in Appendix H.\n\nGoing Beyond BenchmarksWhile our evaluation focuses on benchmark tasks, Self-Refine is designed with broader applicability in mind. We explore this in a real-world use case of website generation, where the user provides a high-level goal and Self-Refine assists in iteratively developing the website. Starting from a rudimentary initial design, Self-Refine refines HTML, CSS, and JS to evolve the website in terms of both usability and aesthetics. This demonstrates the potential of Self-Refine in real-world, complex, and creative tasks. See Appendix I for examples and further discussion, including broader, societal impact of our work.\n\n## 5 Related work\n\nLeveraging human- and machine-generated natural language (NL) feedback for refining outputs has been effective for a variety of tasks, including summarization (Scheurer et al., 2022), script generation (Tandon et al., 2021), program synthesis (Le et al., 2022; Yasunaga and Liang, 2020), and other tasks (Bai et al., 2022; Schick et al., 2022; Saunders et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022; Welleck et al., 2022). Refinement methods differ in the source and format of feedback, and the way that a refiner is obtained. Table 3 summarizes some related approaches; see Appendix B for an additional discussion.\n\nSource of feedback.Humans have been an effective source of feedback (Tandon et al., 2021; Elgohary et al., 2021; Tandon et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022). Since human feedback is costly, several approaches use a scalar reward function as a surrogate of (or alternative to) human feedback (e.g., (Bai et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2022; Lu et al., 2022; Le et al., 2022; Welleck et al., 2022)). Alternative sources such as compilers (Yasunaga and Liang, 2020) or Wikipedia edits (Schick et al., 2022) can provide domain-specific feedback. Recently, LLMs have been used to generate feedback for general domains (Fu et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2022), However, ours is the only method that generates feedback using an LLM on its _own_ output, for the purpose of refining with the same LLM.\n\nRepresentation of feedback.The form of feedback can be generally divided into natural language (NL) and non-NL feedback. Non-NL feedback can come in human-provided example pairs (Dasguptaet al., 2019) or scalar rewards (Liu et al., 2022; Le et al., 2022b). In this work, we use NL feedback, since this allows the model to easily provide _self_-feedback using the same LM that generated the output, while leveraging existing pretrained LLMs such as GPT-4.\n\nTypes of refiners.Pairs of feedback and refinement have been used to learn supervised refiners (Schick et al., 2022b; Du et al., 2022; Yasunaga and Liang, 2020; Madaan et al., 2021). Since gathering supervised data is costly, some methods learn refiners using model generations (Welleck et al., 2022; Peng et al., 2023). However, the refiners are trained for each new domain. Finally, (Yang et al., 2022) use prompted feedback and refinement specifically tailored for story generation. In this work, we avoid training a separate refiner, and show that the same model can be used as both the refiner and the source of feedback across multiple domains.\n\nNon-refinement reinforcement learning (RL) approaches.Rather than having explicit refinement, an alternative way to incorporate feedback is by optimizing a scalar reward function, e.g. with reinforcement learning (e.g., Stiennon et al. (2020); Lu et al. (2022); Le et al. (2022a)). These methods differ from Self-Refine in that the model does not access feedback on an intermediate generation. Second, these RL methods require updating the model's parameters, unlike Self-Refine.\n\n## 6 Limitations and Discussion\n\nThe main limitation of our approach is that the base models need to have sufficient few-shot modeling or instruction-following abilities, in order to learn to provide feedback and to refine in an in-context fashion, without having to train supervised models and rely on supervised data.\n\nFurther, the experiments in this work were performed with language models that are not open-sourced, namely GPT-3.5, ChatGPT, GPT-4, and Codex. Existing literature (Ouyang et al., 2022) does not fully describe the details of these models, such as the pretraining corpus, model sizes, and model biases. Further, these models are not free to use, and using them for research requires some funding. Nonetheless, we release our code and model outputs to ensure the reproducibility of our work.\n\nAnother limitation of our work is that we exclusively experiment with datasets in English. In other languages, the current models may not provide the same benefits.\n\nFinally, there is a possibility for bad actors to use prompting techniques to steer a model to generate more toxic or harmful text. Our approach does not explicitly guard against this.\n\n## 7 Conclusion\n\nWe present Self-Refine: a novel approach that allows large language models to iteratively provide self-feedback and refine their own outputs. Self-Refine operates within a single LLM, requiring neither additional training data nor reinforcement learning. We demonstrate the simplicity and ease of use of Self-Refine across a wide variety of tasks. By showcasing the potential of Self-Refine in diverse tasks, our research contributes to the ongoing exploration and development of large language models, with the aim of reducing the cost of human creative processes in real-world settings.

While ReAct and Reflexion provide a free-form reflection on whether a step was executed correctly and potential improvements, our approach is more granular and structured, with multi-dimensional feedback and scores. This distinction allows our method to offer more precise and actionable feedback, making it suitable for a wider range of natural language generation tasks, including those that may not necessarily involve step-by-step planning such as open-ended dialogue generation.\n\nComparison with Welleck et al. (2022)The closest work to ours may be Self-Correction (Welleck et al., 2022); however, Self-Correction has several disadvantages compared to Self-Refine:\n\n1. Self-Correction does not train their model to generate explicit feedback; instead, Welleck et al. (2022) trained their models to refine only. As we show in Section 4 and Table 2, having the model generate explicit feedback results in significantly better refined outputs.\n2. Self-Correction trains a separate refiner (or \"corrector\") for each task. In contrast, Self-Refine uses instructions and few-shot prompting, and thus does not require training a separate refiner for each task.\n3. Empirically, we evaluated Self-Refine using the same base model of GPT-3 as Self-Correction, and with the same settings on the GSM8K benchmark. Self-Correction achieved 45.9% accuracy while Self-Refine (this work) achieved **55.7% (\\(\\uparrow\\)9.8)**.\n\nComparison with non-refinement reinforcement learning (RL) approaches.Rather than having an explicit refinement module, an alternative way to incorporate feedback is by optimizing a scalar reward function, e.g. with reinforcement learning (e.g., Stiennon et al. (2020); Lu et al. (2022); Le et al. (2022)). These methods differ from Self-Refine (and more generally, refinement-based approaches) in that the model cannot access feedback on an intermediate generation. Second, these reinforcement learning methods require updating the model's parameters, unlike Self-Refine.\n\nSee Table 5 for an additional detailed comparison of related work.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l l l l l} \\hline \\hline\n**Method** & **Primary Novelty** & **recursive** & **multi-agent** & **multi-agent** \\\\ \\hline RLIF (Steiner et al., 2020) & optimize for human preference & trained on feedback & **Single** (human) & **Best** (self goal,) \\\\ \\hline Salimar HL (Liu et al., 2022) & RL to generate knowledge & trained on end task & **Single**(self-correcting) & **Quasi** (only) \\\\ Coak RL (Liu et al., 2022) & quantizing both personal & quantized on end task & **Single(self-correcting)** & **Quasi** (only) \\\\ Coak RL (Liu et al., 2022) & slow critic RL for code improvement & quantized on end task & **Single(self-correcting)** & **Quasi** (final time iter) \\\\ \\hline \\multirow{3}{*}{**DeMotiven (Vasquez and Largo, 2020)**} & **multi-agent** & **multi-agent** & **multi-agent** & **multi-agent** \\\\  & & & & & \\\\ \\cline{1-1} \\cline{2-2} \\cline{4-4}  & **DeMotiven (Vasquez and Largo, 2020)** & **Complexity feedback to iterative agent** & quantized semi-supervised & quantized semi-supervised & quantized semi-supervised & quantized semi-supervised \\\\ \\cline{1-1} \\cline{2-2} \\cline{4-4}  & **Frank (Schaich et al., 2022)** & **do**, edit method on with a task & quantized on existing & quantized semi-supervised & quantized semi-supervised \\\\ Self-context (Wallace et al., 2022) & **and** training of a concrete & quantized on end task & quantized on end task & quantized semi-supervised & quantized semi-supervised \\\\ \\cline{1-1} \\cline{2-2} \\cline{4-4}  & **Goss (Allan et al., 2020)** & train RL/P and automated (self-correcting training, version) pair & quantized semi-supervised & quantized semi-supervised & quantized semi-supervised \\\\ \\hline Self-Task (Trees et al., 2022) & all follows open sets & **Live** shot & **Luce** & **Quasi** (ours) & **X** \\\\ OPT3 score (Wu et al., 2023) & OPT on score generation with instruction & **How** shot & **Single(single utility info)** & **Quasi** (ours) & **X** \\\\ Augmenter (Wang et al., 2023) & **Iterative feedback from self- and KB** & & **Single(self-correcting)** & **\\(\\mathbf{self}\\) & **Quasi** (self-pos)** & **X** \\\\ Re\\({}^{2}\\)* (Wang et al., 2023) & **-comers** & but one domain, paired critics & **How** shot & **Quasi** (ours) & **X** \\\\ Sim-Rurrent & **feedback** & **feedback** & **How** shot & **Quasi** (ours) & **X** \\\\  & & & & & \\\\ \\cline{1-1} \\cline{2-2} \\cline{4-4}  & **N.L.** & & & & & \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 5: Summary of related approaches. Reinforcement learning approaches are shown in purple, trained corrector approaches are shown in orange, and few-shot corrector approaches are shown in green.\n\nHuman Evaluation\n\nThe A/B evaluation in our study was conducted by the authors, where a human judge was presented with an input, task instruction, and two candidate outputs generated by the baseline method and Self-Refine. The setup was blind, i.e., the judges did not know which outputs were generated by which method. The judge was then asked to select the output that is better aligned with the task instruction. For tasks that involve A/B evaluation, we calculate the relative improvement as the percentage increase in preference rate. The preference rate represents the proportion of times annotators selected the output produced by Self-Refine over the output from the baseline method. Table 6 shows the results.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \\hline \\hline\n**Task** & **Self-Refine (\\%)** & **Direct (\\%)** & **Either (\\%)** \\\\ \\hline Sentiment Transfer & 75.00 & 21.43 & 3.57 \\\\ Acronym Generation & 44.59 & 12.16 & 43.24 \\\\ Response Generation & 47.58 & 19.66 & 32.76 \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 6: Relative improvement of Self-Refine in A/B evaluations across different tasks. The values represent normalized preferences, which correspond to the proportion of times the output generated by Self-Refine was selected as better aligned with the task instruction over the baseline method. The evaluation was conducted for 150 examples for each dataset. The judges were not aware of the method that generated each sample.\n\nGPT-4 Evaluation\n\nIn light of the impressive achievements of GPT-4 in assessing and providing reasoning for complex tasks, we leverage its abilities for evaluation in Self-Refine. The approach involves presenting tasks to GPT-4 in a structured manner, promoting the model's deliberation on the task and generating a rationale for its decision. This methodology is demonstrated in Listings 1 to 3:\n\n```\nf\"\"\"Whichreviewisalignedwiththesentiment{target_sentiment}? ReviewA:{review_a} ReviewB:{review_b}.

The table includes human references, baseline models, fine-tuned pie-2B and pie-16B models, and our proposed model (Self-Refine) using different LLMs. Notably, Self-Refine achieves superior performance while using only 4 samples at most, significantly fewer than the 16 and 32 samples employed by other models. Scalene, an off-the-shelf optimizer, uses instruction tuning with Codex and serves as a comparison point.\n\nEvaluation of Vicuna-13b\n\nWe also experiment with Vicuna-13b (Chiang et al., 2023), a version of LLaMA-13b (Touvron et al., 2023) fine-tuned on conversations sourced from the web. Vicuna-13b was able to consistently follow the task initialization prompt. However, it struggled to follow the prompts intended for feedback and refinement. This often led to outputs that resembled assistant-like responses, a representative example of which can be found in Appendix G.\n\nIt's important to note that we used the same prompts for Vicuna-13b as those used with other models in our study. However, the limited performance of Vicuna-13b suggests that this model may require more extensive prompt-engineering for optimal performance.\n\nMixed-refine: Improving Vicuna-13b with ChatGPTWhile the focus of Self-Refine is improvement of the model without any external help, it may be possible to use a smaller model for the initialization, and then involving a bigger model for refinement. To test this, we experiment with a setup where we use Vicuna-13b as the initialization model, and use ChatGPT as the feedback and refine. The results on Math Reasoning show the promise of this approach: while Vicuna-13b was able to get only 24.18% on Math Reasoning, it was able to improve to 40.5% in this mixed-refinement setting.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:21]\n\n## Appendix H Additional Analysis\n\n### Using Oracle Feedback\n\nWe experimented with _Oracle Feedback_ following Welleck et al. (2022). This method uses correctness information to guide model refinement, only progressing to Refine stage if the current answer is incorrect. This adjustment notably enhanced performance in the Math Reasoning task, with GPT-3 improving by 4.8% and GPT-4 by 0.7% Table 9. This indicates the potential of external signals to optimize model performance in particular tasks.\n\nNon-monotonic increase in output quality for acronym generationFor tasks with multi-aspect feedback like Acronym Generation, the output quality can fluctuate during the iterative process, improving on one aspect while losing out on another (Table 10). To address this, Self-Refine's feedback generates explicit numerical scores to capture the different aspects of output quality. This allows for a more balanced evaluation of outputs and the selection of the most appropriate one. The algorithm selects the best output based on the maximum score across all iterations, as described in Algorithm 1 (line 8). A similar selection is possible for other tasks like Math Reasoning and Sentiment Reversal, while we observe that output quality increases monotonically with iterations.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c} \\hline \\hline Iteration & Acronym & Pronunciation & Pron.

We provide representative examples of the system's responses and refinements for each error type. These errors highlight potential areas for improving our feedback handling mechanism, particularly in the interpretation and understanding of user inputs.\n\nTable 12 breaks down errors found in the refinement stage of Self-Refine. Errors include: not being robust (10%), ignoring feedback (25%), and introducing a new problem (20%). We demonstrate how the model handles a variety of feedback types, how robust it is under different circumstances, and how often it inadvertently introduces new issues. 60% of the times, the model is robust to incorrect or generic feedback. These insights can guide us in enhancing the model's refinement capabilities, especially in providing accurate and specific responses.\n\nBeyond Benchmarks\n\nSelf-Refine demonstrates its iterative feedback and refinement capabilities in the context of website layout generation. ChatGPT initially produces a rudimentary layout for a given topic, and then uses the feedback to suggest specific, actionable improvements, as demonstrated in Figures 7 and 9. These suggestions range from design changes such as color and font adjustments, to content enhancements and layout modifications. Figures 8 and 10 showcase the final layouts, post-feedback implementation, highlighting the potential and versatility of Self-Refine across different scenarios.\n\nIce Cream GenerationThe feedback generated by feedback for ice cream generation:\n\n* Change the background color of the container to a light blue color (#6f2ff).\n* Change the font size of the heading to 48px.\n* Add a small icon before the \"Welcome to our ice cream parlor!\" text using the URL [https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/3622/3622340.png](https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/3622/3622340.png).\n* Add an additional paragraph after the existing text with the following text: \"We also offer a variety of toppings and cones to complement your ice cream. Visit us today to try our latest flavors and indulge in a sweet treat!\"\n* Increase the font size of the button text to 24px.\n* Update the button color to #9933.\n\nPhotosynthesisThe feedback generated by feedback for photosynthesis:\n\n* Increase the font size of the text to 18px for better readability.\n* Add more information about the benefits of photosynthesis.\n* Remove the unnecessary margin-top from the header.\n* Add a ruler or divider below the header to separate it from the image.\n\nFigure 7: Initial web layout generated by our model for a fictional ice cream parlor.\n\nDelicious Ice Cream\n\nWelcome to our ice cream parlori We offer a wide range of flavors to suit all tastes, from classic vanilla to exotic mango.

The feedback included changing the background color to light blue (#6f2ff), increasing the heading font size to 48px, adding an icon before the welcome text, enhancing the content with an additional paragraph, increasing the button text size to 24px, and updating the button color to #9933.\n\nFigure 9: Initial web layout generated by our model for a page on photosynthesis.\n\nFigure 10: Refined web layout after applying model feedback.

Gains that are statistical significance based on these confidence intervals are marked with an asterisk.

On various tasks using GPT-3.5, ChatGPT, and GPT-4 as base LLM, Self-Refine consistently improves LLM. Metrics used for these tasks are defined in Section 3.2 as follows: Math Reasoning uses the solve rate; Code Optimization uses the percentage of programs optimized; and Sentiment Reversal, Dialogue Response and Acronym Gen use a GPT-4-based preference evaluation, which measures the percentage of times outputs from the base or enhanced models were selected, with the rest categorized as a tie. Constrained Gen uses the coverage percentage. Gains over Base, that are statistically significant based on these confidence intervals are marked *New Tasks\n\nConstrained GenerationWe introduce \"CommonGen-Hard,\" a more challenging extension of the CommonGen dataset (Lin et al., 2020), designed to test state-of-the-art language models' advanced commonsense reasoning, contextual understanding, and creative problem-solving. CommonGen-Hard requires models to generate coherent sentences incorporating 20-30 concepts, rather than only the 3-5 related concepts given in CommonGen. Self-Refine focuses on iterative creation with introspective feedback, making it suitable for evaluating the effectiveness of language models on the CommonGen-Hard task.\n\nAcronym GenerationAcronym generation requires an iterative refinement process to create concise and memorable representations of complex terms or phrases, involving tradeoffs between length, ease of pronunciation, and relevance, and thus serves as a natural testbed for our approach. We source a dataset of 250 acronyms4 and manually prune it to remove offensive or uninformative acronyms.\n\nFootnote 4: [https://github.com/xrishmakt031990/Crawl-Wiki-For-Acronyms/blob/master/AcronymsFile.csv](https://github.com/xrishmakt031990/Crawl-Wiki-For-Acronyms/blob/master/AcronymsFile.csv)\n\n## Appendix L Code Readability\n\nOrthogonal to the correctness, readability is another important quality of a piece of code: though not related to the execution results of the code, code readability may significantly affect the usability, upgradability, and ease of maintenance of an entire codebase. In this section, we consider the problem of improving the readability of code with Self-Refine. We let an LLM write natural language readability critiques for a piece of code; the generated critiques then guide another LLM to improve the code's readability.\n\n### Method\n\nFollowing the Self-Refine setup, we instantiate init, feedback, and refine. The init is a no-op -- we directly start by critiquing the code with feedback and applying the changes with refine.\n\n* **feedback** We prompt an LLM with the given code and an instruction to provide feedback on readability. We give the LLM the freedom to freely choose the type of enhancements and express them in the form of free text.\n* **refine** The code generator LLM is prompted with the piece of code and the readability improvement feedback provided by feedback. In addition, we also supply an instruction to fix the code using the feedback. We take the generation from the code generator as the product of one iteration in the feedback loop.\n\nStarting from an initial piece of code \\(y_{0}\\), we first critique, \\(c_{1}=\\text{critique}(y_{0})\\), and then edit the code, \\(y_{1}=\\text{editor}(y_{0},c_{1})\\). This is recursively performed \\(N\\) times, where \\(c_{k+1}=\\text{critique}(y_{k})\\) and \\(y_{k+1}=\\text{editor}(y_{k},c_{k+1})\\).\n\n### Experiments\n\nDatasetWe use the CodeNet (Puri et al., 2021) dataset of competitive programming.5 For our purpose, these are hard-to-read multi-line code snippets. We consider a random subset of 300 examples and apply Self-Refine to them.\n\nFootnote 5: [https://github.com/IBM/Project_CodeNet](https://github.com/IBM/Project_CodeNet)\n\nWe also ask human annotators to edit a 60-example subset to assess human performance on this task. The human annotators are asked to read the code piece and improve its readability.\n\nImplementationBoth the critique and the editor models are based on the InstructGPT model (text-davinci-003). We consider the temperature of both \\(T=0.0\\) (greedy) and \\(T=0.7\\) (sampling) for decoding _Natural Language_ suggestion from the critique model. We always use a temperature \\(T=0.0\\) (greedy) when decoding _Programming Language_ from the code editor. Due to budget constraints, we run Self-Refine for \\(N=5\\) iterations. The exact prompts we use can be found in Figures 22-23.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:30]\n\nchallenging to develop a system that can consistently generate coherent and engaging responses. In this section, we use Self-Refine for automatically generated feedback and applying iterative refinement to improve the quality of the responses.\n\n### Modules\n\nWe follow the high-level description of the framework from Section 2, and instantiate our framework as follows.\n\nInitThis is the first step in performing the task. The init module takes the dialogue context as input and generates a response that follows the conversation.\n\nFeedbackWe design an feedback that can provide multifaceted feedback for the quality of the response generated. Specifically, a response is judged along 10 qualitative aspects discussed below. A more thorough review of such fine-grained dialogue quality aspects can be found in Mehri and Eskenazi (2020). We use 6 in-context examples for feedback generation. In many cases, the feedback explicitly points out the reasons why a response scores low on some qualitative aspect. We show an example in Figure 13.\n\n* **Relevant** Does the response addresses all important aspects of the context?\n* Does the response provide some information relevant to the context?\n* Doe the response beyond providing a simple and predictable answer to a question or statement?\n* Is the response consistent with the rest of the conversation in terms of tone and topic?\n* Is the response helpful in providing any information or suggesting any actions?\n* Is the response engaging and encourage further conversation?\n* The response contains specific content related to a topic or question,\n* Is the response safe and does not contain any offensive, toxic or harmful content and does not touch on any sensitive topics or share any personal information?\n* Does the response demonstrate an understanding of the user's input and state of mind?\n* **Fluent** Is the response fluent and easy to understand?\n\nFigure 12: Self-Refine iterations over a piece of densely composed code. Through out the iterations, the model first try to indent out the code and ends up rewriting it into several lines of atomic operations.\n\nIterateThe iterate module takes a sequence of dialogue context, prior generated responses, and the feedback and refines the output to match the feedback better. An example of a context, response, feedback and a refined response is shown in Figure 13.\n\n### Setup and Experiments\n\nModel and BaselineWe establish a natural baseline for our approach by using the model directly, without any feedback, which we refer to as init. Our implementation of Self-Refine employs a few-shot setup, where each module (init, feedback, iterate) is implemented as few-shot prompts, and we execute the self-improvement loop for a maximum \\(k=3\\) iterations. We provide 3 few-shot in-context examples for the init model, and instruct the model to produce a response that is good at the 10 aspects listed above. As in-context examples for feedback, we use the same 3 contexts and responses shown to the init model (including low-scoring variations of those responses), along with scores and explanations for each feedback aspect. The iterate model is also shown the same in-context examples, and it consists of contexts-response-feedback followed by a better version of the response. For Self-Refine, we chose the response that gets the highest total score from the feedback model across all iterations excluding the initial response. We use text-davinci-003 for all the experiments.\n\nFigure 13: Self-Refine prompts for dialogue response generation: init generates a first draft of the response generated in a few-shot manner. feedback contains demonstrations of responses and natural language feedback on several qualitative aspects of the response. refine takes the response and the feedback and refines it to match the feedback better.\n\nEvaluationWe perform experiments on the FED dataset (Mehri and Eskenazi, 2020). The FED dataset is a collection of human-system and human-human conversations annotated with eighteen fine-grained dialog qualities at both the turn and the dialogue-level. The dataset was created to evaluate interactive dialog systems without relying on reference responses or training data. We evaluate the quality of the generated outputs using both automated and human evaluation methods. For automatic evaluation in Table1, we used zero-shot prompting with text-davinci-003 and evaluate on a test set of 342 instances. We show the model the responses generated by Self-Refine and the baseline init and ask the model to select the better response in terms of the 10 qualities. We report the win rate. However, we acknowledge that automated metrics may not provide an accurate assessment of text generation tasks and rely on human evaluation instead.\n\nGiven a dialogue context with a varying number of turns, we generate outputs from the above mentioned methods. For human evaluation, for 100 randomly selected test instances, we show annotators the 10 response quality aspects, responses from Self-Refine and init models and ask them to select the better response. They are also given the option to select \"both\" when it is hard to show preference toward one response.\n\nResultsAutomatic evaluation results are shown in Table1 and human evaluation results are are shown in Table 15. We experiment on 3 latest versions of GPT models. text-davinci-003 is capable of generating human-like responses of great quality for a wide range of dialogue contexts and hence GPT-3.5 is a strong baseline. Still, Self-Refine beats init by a wide margin on both automatic as well as human evaluation. Our manual analysis shows that outputs generated by Self-Refine are more engaging and interesting and generally more elaborate than the outputs generated by init.\n\n## Appendix N Code Optimization\n\nPerformance-Improving Code Edits or PIE (Madaan et al., 2023) focuses on enhancing the efficiency of functionally correct programs. The primary objective of PIE is to optimize a given program by implementing algorithmic modifications that lead to improved runtime performance.\n\nGiven an optimization generated by PIE, Self-Refine first generates a natural language feedback on possible improvements Figure 20. Then, the feedback is fed to refine Figure 21 for refinement.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} \\hline \\hline Setup & Iteration & \\% Optimized & Relative Speedup & Speedup \\\\ \\hline Direct & - & 9.7 & 62.29 & 3.09 \\\\ \\hline Self-Refine \\(-\\) feedback & 1 & 10.1 & 62.15 & 3.03 \\\\ Self-Refine \\(-\\) feedback & 2 & 10.4 & 61.79 & 3.01 \\\\ \\hline Self-Refine & 1 & 15.3 & 59.64 & 2.90 \\\\ Self-Refine & 2 & **15.6** & **65.60** & **3.74** \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 16: Main Results and Ablation Analysis\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c} \\hline \\hline  & GPT-3.5 & ChatGPT & GPT4 \\\\ \\hline Self-Refine wins & 36.0 & 48.0 & 54.0 \\\\ init wins & 23.0 & 18.0 & 16.0 \\\\ Both are equal & 41.0 & 50.0 & 30.0 \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 15: Human evaluation results for dialogue response generation Math Reasoning\n\nWe use the Grade School Math 8k (GSM-8k) dataset (Cobbe et al., 2021) for evaluating Self-Refine on math reasoning. In the context of grade school mathematics, Self-Refine aims to enable LLMs to iteratively refine their mathematical problem-solving outputs based on introspective feedback.\n\nFollowing Gao et al. (2022), we write solutions to the reasoning problems in Python. Consider the following example from the paper, where an error in the code demonstrates a lack of understanding of the problem:\n\ndef solution():  \"\"\"Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of  half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each.  Calculate the total cost of buying each cup.\"\"\"  plates = 6  plate_cost = 6000  cups = 12 * 20  cup_cost = plate_cost  result = cup_cost  return result By using Self-Refine, we can identify the error in the code and refine the solution through an iterative process of introspection and feedback:\n\n_# Let's go through the error and check step-by-step_ plates = 6 plate_cost = 6000\n\n_# Let's check the other parts_ cups = 12 * 20  cup_cost = plate_cost # wrong! The cost of a cup is not the same as the _- cost of a plate. # The cost of a cup is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen _- plates sold at $6000 each._ half_dozen_plate_cost = 6 * plate_cost  cup_cost = half_dozen_plate_cost - 1200\n\nSelf-Refine is thus instantiated naturally: the generator generates an initial solution, and feedback scans the solution to spot errors on which to provide feedback. The feedback is supplied to refine to create a new solution. Following Welleck et al. (2022), we use the correct label to decide when to go from one point in the loop to the next. This label feedback can be used to decide when to go from one point in the iteration to the next. We show results using Self-Refine in Figure 14.\n\n## Appendix P Sentiment Reversal\n\nWe consider the task of long-form text style transfer, where given a passage (a few sentences) and an associated sentiment (positive or negative), the task is to re-write the passage to flip its sentiment (positive to negative or vice-versa). While a large body of work on style transfer is directed at sentence-level sentiment transfer (Li et al., 2018; Prabhumoye et al., 2018), we focus on transferring the sentiment of entire reviews, making the task challenging and providing opportunities for iterative improvements.\n\nInstantiating Self-Refine for sentiment reversalWe instantiate Self-Refine for this task following the high-level description of the framework shared in Section 2. Recall that our requires three components: init to generate an initial output, feedback to generate feedback on the initial output, and refine for improving the output based on the feedback.\n\nSelf-Refine is implemented in a complete few-shot setup, where each module (init, feedback, iterate) is implemented as few-shot prompts. We execute the self-improvement loop for a maximum of \\(k=4\\) iterations. The iterations continue until the target sentiment is reached.\n\n### Details\n\nEvaluationGiven an input and a desired sentiment level, we generate outputs Self-Refine and the baselines. Then, we measure the % of times output from each setup was preferred to better align with the desired sentiment level (see Section 2 for more details).\n\nWe also experiment with standard text-classification metric. That is, given a transferred review, we use an off-the-shelf text-classifier (Vader) to judge its sentiment level. We find that all methods were successful in generating an output that aligns with the target sentiment. For instance, when the target sentiment was positive, both GPT-3.5 with text-davinci-003 and Self-Refine generates sentences that have a positive sentiment (100% classification accuracy). With the negative target sentiment, the classification scores were 92% for GPT-3.5 and 93.6% for Self-Refine.\n\nWe conduct automated and human evaluation for measuring the preference rates for adhering to the desired sentiment, and how dramatic the generations are. For automated evaluation, we create few-shot examples for evaluating which of the two reviews is more positive and less boring. We use a separate prompt for each task. The examples are depicted in Figure 33 for initialization, Figure 34 for feedback generation, and Figure 35 for refinement. The prompts show examples of reviews of varying degrees of sentiment and colorfulness (more colorful reviews use extreme phrases -- the\n\nFigure 14: Improvements in accuracy on the GSM-8k math reasoning benchmark as a function of the # of iterations of Self-Refine.\n\nfood was really bad vs. I wouldn't eat it if they pay me.). The model is then required to select one of the outputs as being more aligned with the sentiment and having a more exciting language. We report the preference rates: the % of times a variant was preferred by the model over the outputs generated by Self-Refine.\n\nPin-pointed feedbackA key contribution of our method is supplying chain-of-thought prompting style feedback. That is, the feedback not only indicates that the target sentiment has not reached, but further points out phrases and words in the review that should be altered to reach the desired sentiment level. We experiment with an ablation of our setup where the feedback module simply says \"something is wrong.\" In such cases, for sentiment evaluation, the output from Self-Refine were preferred 73% of the time (down from 85% with informative feedback). For dramatic response evaluation, we found that the preference rate went down drastically to 58.92%, from 80.09%. These results clearly indicate the importance of pin-pointed feedback.\n\nEvaluationWe evaluate the task using GPT-4. Specifically, we use the following prompt:\n\nWhen both win, we add winning rate to either.\n\n## Appendix Q Acronym Generation\n\nGood acronyms provide a concise and memorable way to communicate complex ideas, making them easier to understand and remember, ultimately leading to more efficient and effective communication. Like in email writing, acronym generation also requires an iterative refinement process to achieve a concise and memorable representation of a complex term or phrase. Acronyms often involve tradeoffs between length, ease of pronunciation, and relevance to the original term or phrase. Thus, acronym generation is a natural method testbed for our approach.\n\nWe source the dataset for this task from [https://github.com/krishnakt031990/Crawl-Wiki-For-Acronyms/blob/master/AcronymsFile.csv](https://github.com/krishnakt031990/Crawl-Wiki-For-Acronyms/blob/master/AcronymsFile.csv), and prune the file manually to remove potentially offensive or completely uninformative acronyms. This exercise generated a list of 250 acronyms. The complete list is given in our code repository.\n\nfeedbackFor feedback, we design an feedback that can provide multifaceted feedback. Specifically, each acronym is judged along five dimensions:\n\n* **Ease of pronunciation:** How easy or difficult is it to pronounce the acronym? Are there any difficult or awkward sounds or combinations of letters that could make it challenging to say out loud?\n* **Ease of spelling:** How easy or difficult is it to spell the acronym? Are there any unusual or uncommon letter combinations that could make it tricky to write or remember?\n* **Relation to title:** How closely does the acronym reflect the content or topic of the associated title, phrase, or concept? Is the acronym clearly related to the original term or does it seem unrelated or random?\n* **Positive connotation:** Does the acronym have any positive or negative associations or connotations? Does it sound upbeat, neutral, or negative in tone or meaning?\n* **Well-known:** How familiar or recognizable is the acronym to the target audience? Is it a common or widely-used term, or is it obscure or unfamiliar?\n\nSome of these criteria are difficult to quantify, and are a matter of human preference. As with other modules, we leverage the superior instruction following capabilities of modern LLMs to instead provide a few demonstrations of each task. Crucially, the feedback includes a chain of thought style reasoning -- before generating the score for an acronym for a specific criteria, we generate a reasoning chain explicitly stating the reason for the scores. We use human evaluation to judge the final quality of the acronyms. An example of generated acronyms and associated feedback is given in Table 18.\n\n## Appendix R Constrained Generation\n\nIn this work, we introduce a more challenging variant of the CommonGen task, dubbed \"CommonGen-Hard,\" designed to push the boundaries of state-of-the-art language models. CommonGen-Hard requires models to generate coherent and grammatically correct sentences incorporating 20-30 concepts, as opposed to the original task which presents a set of 3-5 related concepts. This significant increase in the number of concepts tests the model's ability to perform advanced commonsense reasoning, contextual understanding, and creative problem-solving, as it must generate meaningful sentences that encompass a broader range of ideas. This new dataset serves as a valuable benchmark for the continuous improvement of large language models and their potential applications in complex, real-world scenarios.\n\nThe increased complexity of the CommonGen-Hard task makes it an ideal testbed for evaluating the effectiveness of our proposed framework, Self-Refine, which focuses on iterative creation with introspective feedback. Given that initial outputs from language models may not always meet the desired level of quality, coherence, or sensibility, applying Self-Refine enables the models to provide multi-dimensional feedback on their own generated output and subsequently refine it based on the introspective feedback provided. Through iterative creation and self-reflection, the Self-Refine framework empowers language models to progressively enhance the quality of their output, closely mimicking the human creative process and demonstrating its ability to improve generated text on complex and demanding natural language generation tasks like CommonGen-Hard (Figure 15).\n\n## Appendix S Prompts\n\nWe include all the prompts used in the experiments in Figures 16-35:\n\n* **Acronym Generation:** Figures 16-18\n* **Code Optimization:** Figures 19-21\n* **Code Readability Improvement:** Figures 22-23\n* **Constrained Generation:** Figures 24-26\n* **Dialogue Response Generation:** Figures 27-29\n* **Math Reasoning:** Figures 30-32\n* **Sentiment Reversal:** Figures 33-35\n\nRecall that the Base LLM requires a generation prompt \\(p_{gen}\\) with input-output pairs \\(\\langle x_{i},y_{i}\\rangle\\), the feedback module requires a feedback prompt \\(p_{fb}\\) with input-output-feedback triples \\(\\langle x_{i},y_{i},fb_{i}\\rangle\\), and the refinement module (refine) requires a refinement prompt \\(p_{refine}\\) with input-output-feedback-refined quadruples \\(\\langle x_{i},y_{i},fb_{i},y_{i+1}\\rangle\\).\n\n* **Sentiment Reversal** We create positive and negative variants of a single review from the training set and manually write a description for converting the negative variant to positive\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l l l} \\hline \\hline\n**Criteria** & output from GPT3: **STSLWN** & output from Self-Refine: **Seq2Seq** \\\\ \\hline \\hline Ease of pronunciation & Pronounced as ess-tee-ess-ell-double-you-enn which is very difficult. & Pronounced as seq-two-seq which is easy. \\\\ \\hline \\hline Ease of spelling & Very difficult to spell. & Easy to spell. \\\\ \\hline Relation to title & No relation to the title. & Mentions sequence which is somewhat related to the title. \\\\ \\hline Positive connotation & Meaningless acronym. & Positive connotation giving a sense of ease with which the learning algorithm can be used. \\\\ \\hline Well-known & Not a well-known acronym. & Close to the word sequence which is a well-known word. \\\\ \\hline \\hline Total score & 5/25 & 20/25 \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 18: Comparison of acronyms for input = \u201cSequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks\u201dand vice versa.

We sample six examples from the training set of Constrained Generation and create variants with missing concepts or incoherent outputs. The missing concepts and the reason for incoherence form \\(fb\\).\n* **TODO:** Add relevant information for the remaining task.\n\nFigure 15: A comparison of Self-Refine and direct generation with GPT-3.5 on CommonGen-Hard.\n\nTitle: A Survey of Active Network Research\n\nAcronym: SOMAR\n\nTitle: A Scalable, Commutative Replica Dictatorship for Practical Optimistic\n\nReplication\n\nAcronym: SCRATCHPAD\n\nTitle: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers\n\nAcronym: BERT\n\nTitle: Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks\n\nAcronym: Seq2Seq\n\nTitle: Densely Connected Convolutional Networks for Image Classification\n\nAcronym: DenseNet\n\nTitle: A Dynamic Programming Algorithm for RNA Secondary Structure Prediction\n\nAcronym: DYNALIGN\n\nTitle: Fast Parallel Algorithms for Short-Range Molecular Dynamics\n\nAcronym: FASTMD\n\nTitle: Real-Time Collaborative Editing Systems\n\nAcronym: COCOON\n\nTitle: Efficient Data Structures for Large Scale Graph Processing\n\nAcronym: EDGE\n\nTitle: A program to teach students at UT Southwestern learn about aging\n\nAcronym: SAGE\n\nTitle: Underwater breathing without external accessories\n\nAcronym: SCUBA\n\nTitle: An educational training module for professionals\n\nAcronym: LEAP\n\nTitle: Teaching a leadership program\n\nAcronym: LEAD\n\nFigure 16: Initial generation prompt for Acronym Generation\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:40]\n\nTitle: Computer Science Conference and Education\n\nAcronym: CSCE\n\nScores:\n\n* Ease of pronunciation: CSCE is pronounced \"see-cee\".

However, directly verifying the validity of an\nentire deductive reasoning process is challenging, even with advanced models\nlike ChatGPT. In light of this, we propose to decompose a reasoning verification\nprocess into a series of step-by-step subprocesses, each only receiving their necessary context and premises. To facilitate this procedure, we propose Natural\nProgram, a natural language-based deductive reasoning format. Our approach\nenables models to generate precise reasoning steps where subsequent steps are\nmore rigorously grounded on prior steps. It also empowers language models to\ncarry out reasoning self-verification in a step-by-step manner. By integrating this\nverification process into each deductive reasoning stage, we significantly enhance\nthe rigor and trustfulness of generated reasoning steps.

While CoT allows models to produce more comprehensive reasoning processes, its\nemphasis on intermediate reasoning steps can inadvertently introduce hallucinations [4, 30, 16, 20]\nand accumulated errors [4, 51, 1], thereby limiting models\u2019 ability to produce cogent reasoning\nprocesses.\nIn fact, the pursuit of reliable reasoning is not a contemporary novelty; indeed, it is an intellectual\nendeavor that traces its roots back to the time of Aristotle\u2019s ancient Greece. Motivated by the desire\nto establish a rigorous reasoning process, in his \u201cOrganon,\u201d Aristotle introduced principles of logic,\nin particular, syllogism, a form of logical argument that applies deductive reasoning to arrive at\na conclusion based on two or more propositions assumed to be true. In disciplines that rigorous\nreasoning is critical, such as judical reasoning and mathematical problem solving, documents must be\nwritten in a formal language with a logical structure to ensure the validity of the reasoning process.\n\u2217Equal contribution\n\u2020Qualcomm AI Research is an initiative of Qualcomm Technologies, Inc\nAll datasets and models were solely downloaded and evaluated by the University of California San Diego.\n37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023).\narXiv:2306.03872v3  [cs.CL]  3 Oct 2023\n\fThere are 53 maple trees currently in \nthe park.

By alleviating such errors,\nwe significantly enhance the rigor, trustworthiness, and interpretability of the generated reasoning\noutputs.\nWe yearn for this sequence of reliable knowledge when answering questions. Our goal is to develop\nlanguage models that can propose potential solutions through reasoning in logical structures. Simultaneously, we aim to establish a verifier capable of accurately assessing the validity of these\nreasoning processes. Despite recent significant explorations in the field, such as [48]\u2019s emphasis\non self-consistency and [27, 5]\u2019s innovative use of codes to represent the reasoning process, these\napproaches still exhibit considerable limitations. For example, consistency and reliability are not\ninherently correlated; as for program codes, they are not powerful enough to represent many kinds\nof reasoning process, e.g., in the presence of quantifiers (\u201cfor all\u201d, \u201cif there exists\u201d) or nuances of\nnatural language (moral reasoning, \u201clikely\u201d, ...).\nWe propose leveraging the power of natural language to achieve the deductive reasoning emphasized in\nancient Greek logic, introducing a \u201cnatural program\u201d. This involves retaining natural language for its\ninherent power and avoiding the need for extensive retraining with large data sets. A natural program\n2\n\frepresents a rigorous reasoning sequence, akin to a computer program. We expect implementations\nof the idea to have two properties: 1) that natural programs are generated with minimal effort from an\nexisting language model capable of CoT reasoning, preferably through in-context learning; 2) that\nthe natural program can be easily verified for reliability in the reasoning process.\nThrough a step-by-step investigation, we discovered that large language models have the potential\nto meet our expectation. Na\u00efve CoT prompts like \"Let us think step by step.\" has many flaws, and\nentrusting the entire verification process to a large model like ChatGPT can still lead to significant\nerror rates. However, we found that, if the reasoning process is very short, and only based on\nnecessary premises and contexts, the verification of existing large language models is already quite\nreliable. Therefore, our approach is to design prompts that induce CoT processes comprised of\nrigorous premises/conditions and conclusions with statement labels, and verification can be done by\ngradually isolating very few statements within the long thought chain. Experimentally, we found that\nmost reasoning that passed the verification was rigorous, and many that did not pass had elements of\nimprecision in the reasoning process, even if they occasionally arrived at correct answers.\nIt is worth emphasizing that, we are not looking for a method to just maximize the correctness rate\nof final answers; instead, we aspire to generate a cogent reasoning process, which is more aligned\nwith the spirit of judical reasoning. When combined with sampling-based methods, our method can\nidentify low-probability but rigorous reasoning processes. When repeated sampling fails to yield a\nrigorous reasoning process, we can output \"unknown\" to prevent hallucinations that mislead users.\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of our natural program-based verification approach across a range of\narithmetic and common sense datasets on publicly-available models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3.5-turbo.\nOur key contributions are as follows:\n1. We propose a novel framework for rigorous deductive reasoning by introducing a \u201cNatural\nProgram\u201d format (Fig. 1), which is suitable for verification and can be generated by just in-context\nlearning;\n2. We show that reliable self-verification of long deductive reasoning processes written in our Natural\nProgram format can be achieved through step-by-step subprocesses that only cover necessary context\nand premises;\n3. Experimentally, we demonstrate the superiority of our framework in improving the rigor, trustworthiness, and interpretability of LLM-generated reasoning steps and answers (Fig. 2).\n2\nRelated work\nReasoning with large language models. Recent large language models (LLMs) [3, 8, 57, 47, 38, 18,\n9, 37] have shown incredible ability in solving complex reasoning tasks. Instead of letting LLMs\ndirectly generate final answers as output, prior work have shown that by encouraging step-by-step\nreasoning through proper prompting, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting [50] and many\nothers [21, 59, 58, 44, 48, 60, 25, 54], LLMs exhibit significantly better performance across diverse\nreasoning tasks. To further improve the step-by-step reasoning process, some recent studies have\ninvestigated leveraging external solvers such as program interpreters [39, 5, 27], training and calling\nexternal reasoning modules [11], or performing explicit search to generate deductive steps [2, 46].\nParallel to these works, we do not rely on external modules and algorithms, and we directly leverage\nthe in-context learning ability of LLMs to generate more precise and rigorous deductive reasonings.\nLarge language models as verifiers. Using language models to evaluate model generations has been\na long standing idea [22, 36, 40, 4]. As LLMs exhibit impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, it\nbecomes a natural idea to use LLMs as evaluation and verification tools. For example, [10, 11, 33]\nfinetune LLMs to verify solutions and intermediate steps. LLMs aligned with RLHF [32, 31, 48]\nhave also been employed to compare different model generations. In addition, recent works like\n[43, 52, 28, 6] leverage prompt designs to allow LLMs to self-verify, self-refine, and self-debug\nwithout the need for finetuning. However, these works do not focus on the rigor and trustworthiness\nof the deductive reasoning processes at every reasoning step. In this work, we propose a natural\nlanguage-based deductive reasoning format that allows LLMs to self-verify every intermediate step\nof a deductive reasoning process, thereby improving the rigor and trustfulness of reasoning.\n3\n\fQuestion: Jerry is rolling a six-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage)\nthat he rolls a number greater than $3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?\nGround Truth: There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one\nof them are 3 / 6 = 50%. The chance of rolling one even number is 50%, so the chance of rolling\ntwo in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%. The difference between these two probabilities is 50% - 25%\n= 25%. #### 25\nOutput: There are two possible outcomes for rolling a number greater than 3 out of 6 total\noutcomes, so the probability is 2 / 6 or 1 / 3. For rolling two even numbers in a row, there are\nthree possible outcomes (2-4, 4-6, 6-2) out of 36 total outcomes, so the probability is 3 / 36 or\n1 / 12. To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two even\nnumbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 1 / 3 - 1 / 12 = 1 / 4.\nThis means that it is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even\nnumbers in a row.\nTable 1: An example question from GSM8K with a generated CoT reasoning path with GPT3.5 (turbo), where the output provides a wrong reasoning chain with the correct answer.\nAdditionally, while some recent works [12, 53, 15, 34] have proposed methods to verify individual\nsteps in a reasoning process, our approach distinguishes from these works in the following perspectives: (1) Our approach leverages in-context learning to achieve reasoning verification, without the\nneed for language model finetuning. (2) Our Natural Program-based LLM verification approach\nnot only identifies invalid reasoning steps, but also provides explicit explanations for why they are\ninvalid, detailing the specific reasoning errors involved. (3) Our Natural Program-based reasoning\nand verification approach is compatible with in-context abstract reasoning tasks where reasoning\nsteps do not possess proof-like entailment structures. For example, our approach is compatible with\nthe Last Letters task, where the LLM is instructed to output the concatenation of the last letters\nof all words in a sequence as the final answer. (4) Our Natural Program approach allows the use\nof commonsense knowledge not explicitly listed in premises. For example, consider this problem:\n\u201cMarin eats 4 apples a day. How many apples does he eat in November?\u201d Even though \u201cNovember\nhas 30 days\u201d is not explicitly listed in the premises, Natural Program permits the use of such common\nknowledge within a reasoning step. Our in-context verification process is also capable of handling\nthese implicit premises (e.g., if LLM outputs \u201cNovember has 29 days\u201d in a reasoning step, it will be\nmarked as invalid).\n3\nMotivation and Problem Formulation\nA reasoning-based question-answering (QA) task can be defined as a tuple (Q, C, O, A) [35], where Q\nis the target question; C is the context of a question, such as the necessary background for answering a\nquestion; O = (o1, o2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , ck) are optional answer choices if Q is a K-way multiple choice problem;\nand A is the ground-truth answer. Given Q and C as inputs, large language models (LLMs) [3, 8, 47]\ngenerate a sequence of tokens T = (t1, t2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , tn) to answer the question. Recent works like Chainof-Thought (CoT) [50, 21] leverage prompt engineering in the context C to encourage models to\ngenerate the intermediate reasoning process in T, which benefits LLM performance across diverse\nreasoning tasks. In this case, T consists of a set of m intermediate reasoning steps, which we denote\nas S = (s1, s2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , sm) . Each step si can be represented by a subsequence of the generated tokens\n(tli, tri) \u2286 T. In much prior work, a generated solution is \u201ccorrect\u201d if and only if the predicted final\nanswer in sm matches the ground truth A, which we call answer correct(ness).\nWe observe that for all cases where LLMs produce erroneous final answers, there exists at least one\nmistake among the intermediate reasoning steps S. Moreover, even when the final answer is correct,\nthere might still exist some mistakes among S. This phenomenon, as illustrated in Tab. 1, occurs for\nall LLMs we tested, including state-of-the-art models such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 [32]. Since later\nreasoning steps are conditioned on prior reasoning steps, these mistakes often initiate a snowball\neffect, causing subsequent mistakes to compound. This significantly diminishes the likelihood of\ncorrect problem-solving and impedes the progress towards achieving human-level complex reasoning.\nTherefore, in this work, we place significant emphasis on ensuring the validity of every reasoning\nstep, not just the correctness of the final answer. In particular, we focus on the validity of deductive\nreasoning, an essential component of a logical reasoning process. In deductive reasoning, we are\n4\n\fPrompting\nReasoning Correctness\nGSM8K\nAQuA\nMATH\nAddSub\nDate\nLast Letters\nZero-shot\nCorrect\n0.98\n0.96\n1.00\n0.98\n0.98\n1.00\nIncorrect\n0.04\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n0.04\n0.04\n(Average)\n0.51\n0.51\n0.52\n0.50\n0.51\n0.52\nTwo-shot\nCorrect\n0.98\n0.96\n1.00\n0.92\n1.00\n0.96\nIncorrect\n0.02\n0.04\n0.00\n0.06\n0.26\n0.06\n(Average)\n0.50\n0.50\n0.50\n0.49\n0.63\n0.51\nTable 2: Zero-shot and two-shot reasoning chain verification accuracy for GPT-3.5-turbo (ChatGPT),\nwhere an entire reasoning chain is verified at once.

In the context of reasoning-based QA tasks, for each reasoning step si,\nwe define its deductive validity V (si) as a binary variable.

Specifically, we first introduce our motivation and method for decomposing a deductive verification process into a series of step-by-step processes, each only receiving contexts and premises that\nare necessary. Then, we propose Natural Program, a natural language-based deductive reasoning\nformat, to facilitate local step-by-step verification. Finally, we show that by integrating deductive verification with unanimity-plurality voting, we can improve the trustworthiness of reasoning processes\nalong with final answers. An overview of our approach is illustrated in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2.\n4.1\nDecomposition of Deductive Verification Process\nGiven a reasoning chain S = (s1, s2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , sn), a straightforward idea to verify its deductive validity is\nto ask LLMs to examine the entire reasoning chain at once. To assess the effectiveness of this approach,\nwe conduct a preliminary experiment: for a dataset problem and its reasoning chain S generated\nby ChatGPT, we prompt ChatGPT with \u201cDo you think the above reasoning process is\ncorrect?\nLet\u2019s think step by step\u201d such that its outputs whether there exists any mistake\namong any reasoning step in S. However, as demonstrated in Tab. 2, the verification accuracy is 50%\nfor most datasets, and ChatGPT struggles at finding out mistaken reasonings. Notably, it persistently\noutputs \u201cCorrect\u201d for most reasoning chain queries, regardless of their actual validity.\nWe conjecture that such phenomenon is caused by the abundance of irrelevant premises for each\nreasoning step. Recall that the premises pi for a reasoning step si consist of the the question\nQ, the question context C, along with the prior reasoning steps s\u2264j = {sj : j < i}. For Q\nand C, we can further extract and decompose Q \u222a C into a set of \u201cquestion-related premises\u201d\nQC = {qc1, qc2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , qcm}, where qci is a premise or condition inferred from Q \u222a C. Then, it is\noften the case that most elements of pi = QC \u222a s\u2264j are irrelevant to the validity of si, leading\nto erroneous verifications from language models. A very recent work [41] also observes a similar\nphenomenon where LLMs are easily distracted by irrelevant context.\nHence, we propose a decomposition of the reasoning chain verification process into a series of stepby-step processes, where each step only considers the premises that are necessary. The overall validity\n5\n\fof the reasoning chain, denoted as V (S) = \u2227M\ni=1V (si), can be naturally decomposed into individual\nstep validity V (si). However, achieving such decomposition is highly challenging without imposing\nconstraints on the format of reasoning chains. Additionally, for each si \u2208 S, we aim to ensure that\nit explicitly lists the minimal subset of premises \u00afpi \u2286 pi required for deductive reasoning to avoid\npotential ambiguities during verification. This motivates us to introduce a natural-language-based\ndeductive reasoning format in Section 4.2.\n4.2\nNatural Program Deductive Reasoning Format\nAs previously mentioned in Sec. 4.1, we desire LLMs to output deductive reasoning processes that\ncan be easily verified by themselves, specifically by listing out the minimal set of necessary premises\npi at each reasoning step si. To accomplish its goal, we propose to leverage the power of natural\nlanguage, which is capable of rigorously representing a large variety of reasoning processes and can\nbe generated with minimal effort. In particular, we introduce Natural Program , a novel deductive\nreasoning format for LLMs. More formally, Natural Program consists of the following components:\n\u2022 An instruction for models to extract question-related premises QC. We use the following instruction: \u201cFirst, let\u2019s write down all the statements and relationships\nin the question with labels\".\n\u2022 A numbered-list of question-related premises, each prefixed with \u201c#{premise_number}\u201d.\n\u2022 An instruction for models to generate the reasoning chain S based on the question-related\npremises QC. We use the following instruction: \u201cNext, let\u2019s answer the question\nstep by step with reference to the question and reasoning process\u201d.\n\u2022 A list of prefixed reasoning steps Si. The prefix has the following format:\n#{number} (by {list_of_premises_used}). Here \u201cnumber\u201d equals |QC| + i, and\n\u201clist_of_premises_used\u201d consists of numbers from the smallest subset of premises among\nQC \u222a s\u2264j that are used for the deductive reasoning of si. In addition, for the last reasoning\nstep sm, we ensure that it (1) includes a special tag Final Step; (2) refers to the premise\nnumber of the target question to be answered; (3) explicitly gives the final answer to a\nquestion.\nTo encourage language models to reason in the Natural Program format, we have designed oneshot prompts for different datasets, which are shown Appendix D.2.\nGiven that LLM\u2019s reasoning outputs follow the Natural Program format, we can then verify the deductive validity\nof a single reasoning step si through an instruction that consists of (1) the full descriptions of\npremises used for the reasoning of si; (2) the full description of si; (3) an instruction for validity verification, such as \u201cDouble-check the reasoning process, let\u2019s analyze its\ncorrectness, and end with \"yes\" or \"no\".\u201d Note that throughout this verification process, we only retain the minimal necessary premise and context for si, thereby avoiding irrelevant\ncontext distraction and significantly improving the effectiveness of validation. Additionally, we\nemploy a one-shot prompt for this verification process, which we find very helpful for improving the\nverification accuracy. The prompt is shown in Appendix D.3.\nFigure 1 provides an overview of the complete Natural Program-based deductive reasoning and\nverification process. By using the Natural Program approach, we demonstrate that LLMs are\ncapable of performing explicit, rigorous, and coherent deductive reasoning. Furthermore, Natural\nProgram enables LLMs to self-verify their reasoning processes more effectively, enhancing the\nreliability and trustworthiness of the generated responses.\n4.3\nIntegrating Deductive Verification with Unanimity-Plurality Voting\nGiven that we can effectively verify a deductive reasoning process, we can naturally integrate\nverification with LLM\u2019s sequence generation strategies to enhance the trustworthiness of both the\nintermediate reasoning steps and the final answers. In this work, we propose Unanimity-Plurality\nVoting, a 2-phase sequence generation strategy described as follows. Firstly, similar to prior work\nlike [48], we sample k reasoning chain candidates along with their final answers. In the unanimity\nphase, we perform deductive validation on each reasoning chain. Recall that a chain S is valid (i.e.,\nV (S) = 1) if and only if all of its intermediate reasoning steps are valid (i.e., \u2200i, V (si) = 1). For\neach intermediate reasoning step si, we perform majority voting over k\u2032 sampled single-step validity\n6\n\fpredictions to determine its final validity V (si). We then only retain the verified chain candidates\n{S : V (S) = 1}. In the plurality voting stage, we conduct a majority-based voting among the verified\nchain candidates to determine the final answer. This voting process ensures that the final answer is\nselected based on a consensus among the trustworthy reasoning chains.\n5\nExperiments\nIn this section, we perform evaluations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our Natural Program-based\ndeductive reasoning verification approach over diverse reasoning datasets. Firstly, we show that\nour deductive verification process leads to substantial improvements in the rigor and reliability of\nreasoning chains. Subsequently, we will examine the impact of deductive verification on the accuracy\nof final answers. Our findings reveal that by adopting our Natural Program reasoning format without\nverification, we improve answer correctness on challenging benchmarks. Further applying deductive\nverification leads to slight reductions in final answer accuracy. One reason for this phenomenon is\nthat the verification process effectively identifies and eliminates flawed reasoning chains that still\nproduce correct answers.\n5.1\nExperimental Setup\nBenchmarks. We evaluate the deductive verification accuracy and the answer correctness of reasoning\nchains over a diverse set of reasoning tasks: arithmetic reasoning, symbol manipulation, and date\nunderstanding. For arithmetic reasoning, we utilize the following benchmarks: 1) AddSub [19];\n2) GSM8K [10]; 3) MATH [17]; 4) AQuA [24]. Among these benchmarks, the AddSub and GSM8K\ndatasets involve middle school-level multi-step calculations to arrive at a single number as the final\nanswer. The MATH dataset presents more challenging problems that require expressing the answer\nas a mathematical expression in LaTeX format. These problems involve concepts from linear algebra,\nalgebra, geometry, calculus, statistics, and number theory. AQuA also features similarly challenging\nproblems, except that questions are in a multiple-choice format. For symbol manipulation, we use\nLast Letter Concatenation [50], where the model is tasked with concatenate the last letters of all the\nwords provided in the question. For date understanding, we use the one from BIG-bench [45]\nDeductive verfication evaluation setup. For each of the above benchmarks, we select 100 reasoning\nchains, where 50 of them are deductively valid and 50 of them exhibit reasoning mistakes. The\nground-truth deductive validity of each reasoning chain is determined by human annotators.\nAnswer extraction. To extract answers from reasoning solutions, we first perform text splitting based\non answer prefix patterns such as \u201canswer is\u201d or \u201coption is\u201d. Then, using problem type-specific regular\nexpressions, we extract the final answer. To extract the validity results from deductive verification\nprocesses, we only keep the last sentence of model response. We then extract the validity answer with\nregular expressions to obtain attitude words, e.g., \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d, to determine the validity answer.\nSometimes, language models may not provide a direct answer and instead output phrases like \u201cnot\napplicable\u201d at the end of the response. In such cases, we consider the answer from the model as \"yes\".\nPlease refer to Appendix C for more details.\nModel and Hyperparameters. We conduct our main experiments with GPT-3.5-turbo (ChatGPT) [32]. We also present results for the LLama model-family [47]) in Appendix A, where we\nfind the deductive verification accuracy to be worse than larger models even after finetuning. For\nChatGPT, we use a generation temperature of T = 0.7. For Unanimity-Plurality Voting, we set\nk = 10 and k\u2032 = 3 by default. We use 1-shot prompting for both reasoning chain generation and\ndeductive verification (except reasoning chain generation for the date understanding task where we\nuse 2-shot). See Appendix D.2 and Appendix D.3 for more details.\n5.2\nComparison of Deductive Verification Accuracy\nWe compare the verification accuracy of reasoning chains using two methods: (1) verifying the entire\nreasoning chain at once (as described in Section 4.1) without utilizing the Natural Program, and\n1 Most results for Faithful CoT are from their official repository https://github.com/veronica320/\nFaithful-COT, except MATH and AddSub due to the unavailability. For these two datasets, we use our\nimplementation and the same prompt for the math word problems in their paper. The prompt for Last Letters is\nnot available, so we leave it blank.\n7\n\fVerification Method Reasoning Correctness GSM8k AQuA MATH AddSub Date Last Letters Overall\nCoT\nTwo-shot\nCorrect\n98%\n96%\n100%\n92%\n100%\n96%\n97%\nIncorrect\n2%\n4%\n0%\n6%\n26%\n6%\n7%\n(Average)\n50%\n50%\n50%\n49%\n63%\n51%\n52%\nNatural Program\nOne-shot\nCorrect\n84%\n72%\n70%\n95%\n90%\n96%\n85%\nIncorrect\n84%\n62%\n76%\n40%\n56%\n6%\n54%\n(Average)\n84%\n67%\n73%\n68%\n73%\n51%\n69%\nTable 3: Comparison of deductive verification accuracy of reasoning chains for GPT-3.5-turbo (ChatGPT). We compare two approaches: (1) verifying entire reasoning chains generated by Chain-ofThought prompting; (2) verifying reasoning chains generated in the Natural Program format with\nstep-by-step decomposition. In the latter case, when we verify each reasoning step si, we only keep\nthe necessary subset of premises \u00afpi \u2286 pi. To calculate verification accuracy, for each dataset, we\nrandomly sample 50 reasoning chains that are deductively valid and 50 reasoning steps exhibiting\nincorrect reasonings.\nArithmetic\nCommonsense\nMethods\nGSM8K\nAQuA\nMATH\u2217\nAddSub\nDate\nLast Letters\nCoT + Voting\n87.62% 70.18%\n35.93%\n92.36%\n69.97%\n81.60%\nFaithful CoT + Voting\n75.80%\n61.80% 31.78%1 88.35%1 73.50%\n-\nOurs (Natural Program (NP), No Verification) 87.05% 70.34% 36.75% 93.67% 72.49%\n92.98%\nOurs (NP + Deductive Verification + UPV)\n86.01%\n69.49%\n36.48%\n93.54%\n71.45%\n92.60%\nTable 4: Final answer accuracy comparison on GPT-3.5-turbo (ChatGPT). All approaches generate\nk = 10 reasoning chains for each problem before performing majority voting or reasoning chain\nfiltering with our deductive verification approach.\n(2) our Natural Program-based verification approach with step-by-step decomposition. The results,\npresented in Table 3, indicate that our approach achieves significantly higher reasoning verification\naccuracy across most datasets. It effectively identifies erroneous reasoning in faulty chains while\nmaintaining a low rate of false positives for valid chains. However, we observe that our approach\u2019s\neffectiveness is limited on the \u201cLast Letters\u201d task. We hypothesize that this is due to the task\u2019s\nnature, where each subsequent reasoning step is conditioned on all previous steps, presenting greater\nchallenges for reasoning verification due to the increased dependency among premises.\n5.3\nImpact of Natural Program and Deductive Verification on Final Answer Correctness\nWe then investigate the impact of our Natural Program reasoning format and our deductive verification\nprocess on final answer correctness. We conduct two experiments: (1) for each problem, we instruct\nlanguage models to generate k = 10 reasoning chain candidates in the Natural Program (NP) format\nand perform simple majority voting on final answers, without using deductive verification to filter out\nreasoning chain candidates; (2) applying our deductive verification approach to filter out reasoning\nchain candidates, and apply Unanimity-Plurality Voting (UPV) along the process to determine the\nfinal answer. As a reference, we also report the performance of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [50] and\nFaithful CoT [27]. For these baselines, we perform simple answer-based majority voting with k = 10\nfor fair comparison.\nResults are presented in Tab. 4. While our major goal is to improve the trustworthiness and reliability\nof deductive reasoning, we find that prompting language models to reason in our Natural Program\nformat achieves on-par or better final answer accuracy than baselines over many reasoning tasks.\nUpon further applying our deductive verification approach to filter out invalid reasoning chains, we\nobserve a slight decrease in final answer accuracy. One major contributing factor to this decrease\nis the filtering out of reasoning chain candidates that provide correct answers but exhibit incorrect\nreasoning. We illustrate an example in Table 5, where ChatGPT generates the correct final answer\nbut assigns incorrect premise numbers to support the first reasoning step. We note that in many such\ncases, our approach effectively identifies these reasoning errors, thereby enhancing the rigor and\n8\n\fQuestion: In March it rained 0.81 inches. It rained 0.35 inches less in April than in March.\nHow much did it rain in April?\nGround Truth: It rained 0.81 - 0.35 = 0.46 inches.\nGPT-3.5-turbo (ChatGPT):\nQuestion-related premises:\n#1. It rained 0.81 inches in March.\n#2. It rained 0.35 inches less in April than in March.\n#3. How much did it rain in April?\nThe first reasoning step:\n#4. (by #2) Step 1: Calculate how much it rained in April by subtracting the difference of 0.35 inches from\nthe amount in March.\nAmount of rain in April: 0.81 - 0.35 = 0.46 inches\nTable 5: For this reasoning chain candidate of this GSM8k problem, ChatGPT generates the correct\nfinal answer but provides incorrect premise numbers for grounding the first reasoning step. In \u201cStep\n1\u201d, the correct premise numbers should be #1 and #2. Our deductive reasoning verification approach\neffectively identifies these reasoning errors, enhancing the rigor and trustworthiness of the reasoning\nprocess. It is worth noting that removing a correct answer from the candidate reasoning chains has a\nslightly negative impact on the overall final answer correctness.\nPremise Context\n# Shots\nReasoning Correctness\nGSM8K\nAQuA\nMATH\nAddSub\nDate\nLast Letters\nAverage\nFull Premises\n1\nCorrect\n64%\n54%\n58%\n95%\n26%\n96%\n66%\nWrong\n56%\n68%\n56%\n24%\n76%\n5%\n48%\n(Average)\n60%\n61%\n57%\n60%\n51%\n51%\n57%\nMinimal Premises\n0\nCorrect\n84%\n78%\n90%\n96%\n90%\n12%\n75%\nWrong\n26%\n12%\n28%\n20%\n20%\n80%\n31%\n(Average)\n55%\n45%\n59%\n58%\n55%\n46%\n53%\nMinimal Premises\n1\nCorrect\n84%\n72%\n70%\n95%\n90%\n96%\n85%\nWrong\n84%\n62%\n76%\n40%\n56%\n6%\n54%\n(Average)\n84%\n67%\n73%\n68%\n73%\n51%\n69%\nTable 6: Ablation study on the impact of (1) premise context and (2) zero-shot vs. few-shot scenarios\non deductive verification accuracy using our Natural Program-based approach with step-by-step\nreasoning chain decomposition.

For each dataset, we randomly sample 50\nreasoning chains that are deductively valid and 50 reasoning steps exhibiting incorrect reasonings.\nreliability of the language models\u2019 reasoning processes, albeit with a slight negative impact on the\noverall final answer correctness. Further discussions are presented in Appendix B.\n5.4\nAblation Study\nIn addition, we perform several ablation studies to gain further insights into the designs of our\ndeductive verification approach. In Tab. 6, we compare two different approaches to verify a single\nreasoning step si \u2208 S following our Natural Program format. The first approach utilizes all premises\npi = QC \u222a S\u2264j for verification regardless of their relevance to si, potentially introducing irrelevant\ncontexts. The second approach follows our design in Sec. 4.1 and only includes the necessary context\nand premises \u00afpi \u2286 pi. We observe that removing irrelevant premises significantly improves the\nreasoning chain verification accuracy on many datasets, highlighting the importance of this technique.\nWe also ablate on our Unanimity-Plurality Voting strategy by investigating the impact of different k\u2032.\nRecall that k\u2032 determines the number of votes to produce validity predictions of single-step reasoning.\nResults are shown in Tab. 7. We observe that increasing k\u2032 generally enhances reasoning validation\naccuracy, though we note that this is at the expense of more compute.\n6\nLimitations\nWhile we have demonstrated the effectiveness of Natural Program-based deductive reasoning verification to enhance the trustworthiness and interpretability of reasoning steps and final answers, it is\n9\n\fAnswer Correctness k\u2032 = 1 k\u2032 = 3 k\u2032 = 5 k\u2032 = 10\nCorrect\n86%\n90%\n90%\n92%\nWrong\n38%\n38%\n38%\n40%\nTable 7: Ablation of different values of k\u2032 on the verification accuracy of reasoning chains using our\nUnanimity-Plurality Voting strategy.

How many pennies does Melanie have now?\nGround Truth: Melanie have 17 + 27 + 19 = 63 pennies.\nChatGPT\u2019s reasoning step:\n#5. (by #1) Step 1: Calculate the number of pennies Melanie had initially.\nNumber of pennies in 10 quarters: 10 * 25 = 250\nNumber of pennies initially: 250 + 17 = 267\nTable 8: An example question with ambiguous wordings. The term \"pennies\" in this question can\nbe interpreted as either a type of coin or a unit of currency. In this particular question, \"pennies\" is\ntreated as a type of coin. However, the initial reasoning step by ChatGPT mistakenly treats \"pennies\"\nas a unit of currency, resulting in the conversion of all Melanie\u2019s money into \"pennies\" (highlighted\nin red). Consequently, all subsequent reasoning steps follow this flawed logic, leading to an incorrect\nreasoning trace. Our deductive verification is not yet able to detect such errors.\nimportant to acknowledge that our approach has limitations. In this section, we analyze a common\nsource of failure cases to gain deeper insights into the behaviors of our approach. The failure case, as\nshown in Tab. 8, involves the ambiguous interpretation of the term \u201cpennies,\u201d which can be understood\nas either a type of coin or a unit of currency depending on the context. The ground truth answer\ninterprets \u201cpennies\u201d as coins, while ChatGPT interprets it as a unit of currency. In this case, our\ndeductive verification process is incapable of finding such misinterpretations. Contextual ambiguities\nlike this are common in real-world scenarios, highlighting the current limitation of our approach.\n7\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we aim to enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform explicit and rigorous\ndeductive reasoning while ensuring the trustworthiness of their reasoning processes through selfverification. To this end, we have proposed a novel framework based on \u201cNatural Program\u201d, a natural\nlanguage-based deductive reasoning format that facilitates reasoning verification and can be easily\ngenerated through in-context learning. Within this framework, we decompose the verification process\nof complex reasoning chains into step-by-step subprocesses that focus solely on necessary context and\npremises, allowing us to significantly enhance the accuracy of verification. Additionally, we introduce\na Unanimity-Plurality Voting strategy to further improve verification accuracy. Experimentally,\nwe demonstrate the superiority of our framework in improving the rigor, trustworthiness, and\ninterpretability of reasoning steps and answers.\nBroader Impact. While our deductive verification approach can mitigate hallucinations and reasoning\nerrors of Large Language Models (LLMs), it does not completely eliminate these phenomena.\nLLMs can still produce harmful and biased content, make incorrect claims, and produce wrongful\nadvice. This issue becomes particularly significant when LLMs engage in complex reasoning chains,\nincreasing the risk of misleading users. Consequently, it is still crucial for users to exercise great\ncaution when interacting with, deploying, or developing LLM-based applications.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to express our sincere gratitude to Tongzhou Mu and Caiwei Xiao from UC San\nDiego, Kairong Luo from Tsinghua University, and Pulkit Madan, Reza Pourreza, Sunny Panchal,\nand Apratim Bhattacharyya from Qualcomm for their valuable discussions and feedback.\n10\n\fReferences\n[1] Kushal Arora, Layla El Asri, Hareesh Bahuleyan, and Jackie Chi Kit Cheung.

We select two\npopular models: Vicuna-7B and Vicuna-13B [7]. These models are fine-tuned versions of LLaMA-7B\nand LLaMA-13B [47] using the ShareGPT data3. We use the same Natural Program-based one-shot\nverification method we used in the main paper. Results are shown in the first and the third rows\nof Table 9. We observe for the original Vicuna models without finetuning, Vicuna-7B exhibits\npoor performance in deductive verification and fails to find out reasoning mistakes, while the larger\nVicuna-13B exhibits better verification accuracy.\nModels\nReasoning Correctness GSM8K AQuA MATH AddSub Date Last Letters Overall\nVicuna-7B\nCorrect\n80%\n86%\n96%\n98%\n96%\n80%\n89%\nWrong\n14%\n22%\n16%\n6%\n20%\n34%\n19%\n(Average)\n47%\n54%\n56%\n52%\n58%\n57%\n54%\nVicuna-7B\n(fine-tuned)\nCorrect\n68%\n48%\n46%\n76%\n46%\n32%\n53%\nWrong\n72%\n86%\n54%\n60%\n72%\n68%\n69%\n(Average)\n70%\n67%\n50%\n68%\n61%\n50%\n61%\nVicuna-13B\nCorrect\n86%\n82%\n92%\n96%\n72%\n74%\n84%\nWrong\n32%\n36%\n20%\n20%\n34%\n30%\n29%\n(Average)\n59%\n59%\n56%\n58%\n53%\n52%\n57%\nVicuna-13B\n(fine-tuned)\nCorrect\n74%\n50%\n56%\n86%\n72%\n12%\n58%\nWrong\n72%\n76%\n72%\n68%\n62%\n96%\n74%\n(Average)\n73%\n63%\n64%\n77%\n67%\n54%\n66%\nChatGPT\n(GPT-3.5-Turbo)\nCorrect\n84%\n72%\n70%\n95%\n90%\n96%\n85%\nWrong\n84%\n62%\n76%\n40%\n56%\n6%\n54%\n(Average)\n84%\n67%\n73%\n68%\n73%\n51%\n69%\nTable 9: One-shot Deductive Verification Accuracy of Vicuna-7B and Vicuna-13B. The models are\nevaluated with or without finetuning on our deductive verification dataset. For each dataset, we\nrandomly sample 50 reasoning chains that are deductively valid and 50 reasoning steps exhibiting\nincorrect reasonings.\nWe therefore conduct an additional experiment to investigate if the verification accuracy of Vicuna\nmodels can be improved by fine-tuning. To this end, we generate a deductive verification dataset,\nwhich consists of 2000 reasoning steps evenly distributed between correct and incorrect categories.\nWe automatically generate this dataset using GPT-3.5-turbo since it exhibits a very high accuracy of\nsingle-step verification. We first use GPT-3.5-turbo to generate solutions for problems in GSM8K\u2019s\ntraining set. We then execute step-by-step deductive verification on these solutions using GPT-3.5turbo. For solutions that result in correct final answers, we retain the reasoning steps that pass\ndeductive verification. For solutions that yield incorrect final answers, we retain the reasoning\nsteps that cannot pass deductive verification. After constructing our dataset, we then fine-tune the\nVicuna models using the verifications of the 2000 reasoning steps. Models were fine-tuned with 4\nA100-80GB over 3 epochs. Training parameters are shown in Table 10.\nAs shown in Tab. 9, we observe that fine-tuning with our dataset can enhance the deductive verification\naccuracy of Vicuna models not only on the dataset where the training dataset is constructed (GSM8K),\nbut also on many other datasets. However, the accuracy is still worse than non-finetuned GPT-3.5,\nwhich suggests that model capacity has a significant impact on deductive verification capabilities.\nB\nMore Discussion on Improvements of Deductive Verification Accuracy\nVersus Improvements on Final Answer Correctness\nIn the main paper, we demonstrated that our verification approach significantly improves the verification accuracy of reasoning chains (Tab. 3, 6, but barely improves the final answer accuracy (Tab. 4).\nWe further analyze this phenomenon below:\n3https://github.com/domeccleston/sharegpt\n15\n\fHyperparameters\nValue\nOptimizer\nAdamW\nLearning rate\n1 \u00d7 10\u22125\nWeight decay\n0.00\nNum epochs\n3\nBatch size\n64\nLearning rate schedule\nLinear\nTable 10: Hyperparameters for finetuning Vicuna models with our deductive verification dataset.\nConsider the GSM8K dataset as an example (recall that the final answer for a problem is obtained\nthrough majority voting). Among all problems, 91.6% of problems have |(number of votes received\nby the correct answer) \u2212 (largest number of votes received by a single wrong answer)| > 2, and their\nfinal answers are unlikely to be changed through our deductive verification approach. For the rest of\nthe cases (8.4%), where deductive verification is more likely to impact their final answers, we found\nthat:\n\u2022 Among all reasoning chains that arrive at correct answers (these correct-answer chains\naccount for 49.4% of all reasoning chain candidates), 46.2% of reasoning chains are filtered\nout by our verification process.\n\u2022 Among the reasoning chains that arrive at correct answer but are filtered out by our verification process, 76.3% indeed exhibit incorrect reasoning.\n\u2022 Among the reasoning chains that arrive at correct answer and are not filtered out by our\nverification process, 78.0% indeed have correct reasonings.\n\u2022 Among the reasoning chains that do not arrive at correct answer and exhibit incorrect\nreasonings (these account for 50.6% of all reasoning chain candidates), 40.6% are filtered\nout by our verification process.\nThe above statistics shows that a significant portion of reasoning chains that arrive at correct answers\nbut exhibit incorrect reasoning are successfully eliminated. Therefore, the reliability and trustfulness\nof reasoning chains that arrive at the correct answers are significantly improved. Combined with the\nfact that a significant proportion of reasoning chains that exhibit incorrect answers are eliminated, and\nthat our approach\u2019s verification accuracy significantly improves over naive verification approaches,\nour primary goal to improve LLM reasoning reliability is accomplished.\nNevertheless, the removals of many reasoning chains yielding correct answers (specifically, a significant 46.2% \u00d7 49.4% of all chains) has a notable impact. This even exceeds the removals of reasoning\nchains with incorrect reasonings and answers (40.6% \u00d7 50.6% of all chains). As a result, there are\nfewer votes for the correct answer when generating final answers through majority voting, which\nlimits the final answer accuracy. In the future, we believe that when a greater proportion of incorrect\nreasoning chains with incorrect answers are filtered out, we can improve the final answer accuracy.\nC\nMore Details on Answer Extraction\nIn this section, we describe our process to extract the final answer from language models\u2019 responses.\nThe process begins by selecting the last three non-empty lines. Then, these lines are processed\nthrough the following pipeline:\n1. Firstly, we use a list of regular expressions to identify \"No-Answer\" patterns within the text,\nsuch as \"we cannot answer (this|the) question\". This process helps us ascertain whether the\nmodel can provide a conclusive answer. If any such patterns appear in the text, we mark\n\"No answer!\" as the final answer. However, if we don\u2019t detect these patterns, we proceed to\nthe next steps for extracting the final answer.\n2. Secondly, if any \"Answer-Split\" patterns are found in the text, we divide the text into several\nblocks using the identified pattern. The last block of text is then utilized for extracting the\nanswer.\n16\n\f3. Lastly, we use regular expressions, as outlined in Tab. 11, to scan the remaining text for\npossible final answers. If multiple matches are found for the pattern, we select the first\nmatch as the final answer. If no pattern matches are found in the remaining text, we default\nthe final response to \"No answer!\".\n\u201cNo-Answer\u201d Patterns: \"we cannot provide an answer to this question with (this|the) given information\", \"we cannot answer (this|the) question\", \"we cannot determine\", \"we can\u2019t determine\", \"we do\nnot have enough information to answer (this|the) question\", \"we do not have enough information to\nprovide a definitive answer to (this|the) question\", \"the answer(.*?)is unknown\", \"answer is not listed\namong the answer choices\".\n\u201cAnswer-Split\u201d Patterns: \"answer is\", \"final answer:\", \"answer to the question is\", \"answer to this\nquestion is\", \"concatenated letters are\", \"concatenate the letters -\", \"The answer of \".\nAnswer Type\nRegular Expression\nNumber\n(-?\\d[\\d,\\. ]*)\nFractional number\n(-?\\(\\d+\\/\\d+\\)\\/\\d+|-?\\d+\\/\\d+)\nDate\n(\\d\\d\\/\\d\\d\\/\\d\\d\\d\\d)\nYes or No\n(?:Yes|No|yes|no|NO|YES)\nTable 11: Regular Expression for extracting the final answers of different kinds of questions.\nD\nPrompts\nD.1\nPrompt for Direct Reasoning Chain Verification Without Natural Program Format\nFor the results in Tab. 2 of the main paper, We use \u201cDo you think the above reasoning process is\ncorrect? Let\u2019s think step by step.\u201d as the zero-shot prompt to verify an entire reasoning chain at once.\nWe also design a two-shot prompt for reasoning chain verification as shown in Tab. 12, which covers\none correct reasoning chain and one incorrect reasoning chain.\nD.2\nPrompts for Reasoning Chain Generation in the Natural Program Format\nTo instruct models to generate reasoning chains in the Natural Program format that facilitates stepby-step deductive verification, we have designed four distinct prompts to address different types of\nproblems. These include:\n1. Math word problems, as illustrated in Tab. 13, covering GSM8K, MATH, and AddSub\ndatasets.\n2. Math word problems with multiple-choice options, illustrated in Tab. 14, covering the AQuA\ndataset.\n3. Date-related problems, illustrated in Tab. 15, covering the Date dataset.\n4. Last Letters problems, illustrated in Tab. 16, covering the Last Letters dataset.\nD.3\nPrompt for Deductive Verification Following Natural Program Format and Step-by-Step\nDecomposition\nWe have designed a general one-shot prompt for the deductive verification of a single reasoning step\non different datasets, as shown in Tab. 17. This prompt serves to instruct language models to generate\nthe deductive validity of each reasoning step as illustrated in Sec. 4.2 and the top-right box of Fig. 1\nof the main paper.\nE\nMore Deductive Verification Examples\nIn this section, we present more deductive verification examples using our Natural Program-based\napproach on single reasoning steps.\n17\n\fIn Tab. 18, we demonstrate that the language model (ChatGPT) not only successfully identifies\nungrounded information, but also identifies logical errors within the given solutions.\nIn Tab. 19, we illustrate a case where the language model fails to detect ungrounded premise numbers,\nmistakenly assuming that these numbers can be derived from grounded ones.\nLastly, in Tab. 20, we illustrate a case where the language model is sometimes unable to correctly\nidentify grounded numbers.\n18\n\fHere is a math question and its solution:\n\"Question:\nJason had 20 lollipops. He gave Denny some lollipops. Now Jason has 12 lollipops. How many lollipops\ndid Jason give to Denny?\nAnswer:\nJason started with 20 lollipops. Then he had 12 after giving some to Denny. So he gave Denny 20 + 12 =34.\nThe answer is 34.\"\nYou are a math teacher. Do you think the reasoning process is correct?\nLet\u2019s check the \"Answer\" step by step, and then end with \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:\nThe problem statement is clear, but the reasoning process has a major error in it.\nLet\u2019s go through it step by step:\n1. \"Jason started with 20 lollipops.\" This is correct according to the problem statement.\n2. \"Then he had 12 after giving some to Denny.\" This is also correct as per the problem.\n3. \"So he gave Denny 20 + 12 =34. The answer is 34.\" This is incorrect. The correct reasoning process\nshould be subtracting the number of lollipops he ended up with from the number he started with.\nThat would be 20 - 12 = 8 lollipops.\nSo, Jason gave Denny 8 lollipops, not 34. No, the reasoning process is incorrect.\nHere is a math question and its solution:\n\"Question:\nOlivia has $23. She bought five bagels for $3 each. How much money does she have left?\nAnswer:\nOlivia had 23 dollars. 5 bagels for 3 dollars each will be 5 x 3 = 15 dollars. So she has 23 - 15 dollars left.\n23 - 15 is 8. The answer is 8.\"\nYou are a math teacher. Do you think the reasoning process is correct?\nLet\u2019s check the \"Answer\" step by step, and then end with \"yes\" or \"no\".\nAnswer:\nLet\u2019s go through this reasoning process step by step.\n1. \"Olivia had 23 dollars.\" This is the given starting amount of money that Olivia has. This step is correct.\n2. \"5 bagels for 3 dollars each will be 5 x 3 = 15 dollars.\" This is correct as well. Olivia spends 3 dollars\nfor each bagel, and she buys 5 of them. So the total cost of the bagels is 3 dollars/bagel x 5 bagels = 15 dollars.\n3. \"So she has 23 - 15 dollars left.\" This statement is also correct. After purchasing the bagels, Olivia will\nhave her initial amount of money minus the cost of the bagels.\n4. \"23 - 15 is 8. The answer is 8.\" This step is correct as well. 23 dollars (Olivia\u2019s initial amount) - 15 dollars\n(the cost of the bagels) = 8 dollars. This means that Olivia has 8 dollars left after buying the bagels.\nSo overall, Olivia has 8 dollars left after buying five bagels for 3 dollars each. Yes, the reasoning process\nis correct.\nTable 12: Two-shot prompt for direct reasoning chain verification without Natural Program format.\n19\n\fQuestion:\nAlice buys 5 apples.

While CoT allows models to produce more comprehensive reasoning processes, its emphasis on intermediate reasoning steps can inadvertently introduce hallucinations and accumulated errors, thereby limiting models' ability to solve complex reasoning tasks. Inspired by how humans engage in careful and meticulous deductive logical reasoning processes to solve tasks, we seek to enable language models to perform _explicit and rigorous deductive reasoning_, and also ensure the _trustworthiness_ of their reasoning process through self-verification. However, directly verifying the validity of an entire deductive reasoning process is challenging, even with advanced models like ChatGPT. In light of this, we propose to decompose a reasoning verification process into a series of step-by-step subprocesses, each only receiving their necessary context and premises. To facilitate this procedure, we propose **Natural Program**, a _natural language-based_ deductive reasoning format. Our approach enables models to generate precise reasoning steps where subsequent steps are more rigorously grounded on prior steps. It also empowers language models to carry out reasoning self-verification in a _step-by-step_ manner. By integrating this verification process into each deductive reasoning stage, we significantly enhance the rigor and trustfulness of generated reasoning steps. Along this process, we also improve the answer correctness on complex reasoning tasks. Code will be released at [https://github.com/lzloceani/verify_cot](https://github.com/lzloceani/verify_cot).\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nThe transformative power of large language models, enhanced by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting [50; 21; 59; 42], has significantly reshaped the landscape of information processing [14; 26; 49; 56; 13; 55; 23; 29], fostering enhanced abilities across a myriad of disciplines and sectors. While CoT allows models to produce more comprehensive reasoning processes, its emphasis on intermediate reasoning steps can inadvertently introduce hallucinations [4; 30; 16; 20] and accumulated errors [4; 51; 1], thereby limiting models' ability to produce cogent reasoning processes.\n\nIn fact, the pursuit of reliable reasoning is not a contemporary novelty; indeed, it is an intellectual endeavor that traces its roots back to the time of Aristotle's ancient Greece. Motivated by the desire to establish a rigorous reasoning process, in his \"Organon,\" Aristotle introduced principles of _logic_, in particular, syllogism, a form of logical argument that applies deductive reasoning to arrive at a conclusion based on two or more propositions assumed to be true. In disciplines that rigorous reasoning is critical, such as judicial reasoning and mathematical problem solving, documents must be written in a formal language with a logical structure to ensure the validity of the reasoning process.\n\nWe yearn for this sequence of reliable knowledge when answering questions. Our goal is to develop language models that can propose potential solutions through reasoning in logical structures. Simultaneously, we aim to establish a verifier capable of accurately assessing the validity of these reasoning processes. Despite recent significant explorations in the field, such as [48]'s emphasis on self-consistency and [27, 5]'s innovative use of codes to represent the reasoning process, these approaches still exhibit considerable limitations. For example, consistency and reliability are not inherently correlated; as for program codes, they are not powerful enough to represent many kinds of reasoning process, e.g., in the presence of quantifiers (\"for all\", \"if there exists\") or nuances of natural language (moral reasoning, \"likely\",...).\n\nWe propose leveraging the power of natural language to achieve the deductive reasoning emphasized in ancient Greek logic, introducing a _\"natural program\"_. This involves retaining natural language for its inherent power and avoiding the need for extensive retraining with large data sets. A natural program\n\nFigure 1: An overview of our proposed deductive reasoning and verification process. In response to an input question, LLMs generate deductive reasoning chains using the _Natural Program_ format (bottom 3 boxes), a natural language-based deductive reasoning approach. The Natural Program format allows individual reasoning steps (an example in purple) and their corresponding minimal set of premises (an example in orange) to be easily extracted. This streamlined extraction process facilitates the step-by-step decomposition and verification of deductive reasoning (top-right box).\n\nFigure 2: Through our Natural Program-based deductive reasoning verification approach, we identify and eliminate reasoning chains that contain errors in reasoning and grounding (we define grounding error as utilizing information that is not present in cited premises). By alleviating such errors, we significantly enhance the rigor, trustworthiness, and interpretability of the generated reasoning outputs.\n\nrepresents a rigorous reasoning sequence, akin to a computer program. We expect implementations of the idea to have two properties: 1) that natural programs are generated with minimal effort from an existing language model capable of CoT reasoning, preferably through in-context learning; 2) that the natural program can be easily verified for reliability in the reasoning process.\n\nThrough a step-by-step investigation, we discovered that large language models have the potential to meet our expectation. Naive CoT prompts like \"Let us think step by step.\" has many flaws, and entrusting the entire verification process to a large model like ChatGPT can still lead to significant error rates. However, we found that, if the reasoning process is very short, and only based on necessary premises and contexts, the verification of existing large language models is already quite reliable. Therefore, our approach is to design prompts that induce CoT processes comprised of rigorous premises/conditions and conclusions with statement labels, and verification can be done by gradually isolating very few statements within the long thought chain. Experimentally, we found that most reasoning that passed the verification was rigorous, and many that did not pass had elements of imprecision in the reasoning process, even if they occasionally arrived at correct answers.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing that, we are not looking for a method to just maximize the correctness rate of final answers; instead, we aspire to generate a cogent reasoning process, which is more aligned with the spirit of judicial reasoning. When combined with sampling-based methods, our method can identify low-probability but rigorous reasoning processes. When repeated sampling fails to yield a rigorous reasoning process, we can output \"unknown\" to prevent hallucinations that mislead users.\n\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of our natural program-based verification approach across a range of arithmetic and common sense datasets on publicly-available models like OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo. Our key contributions are as follows:\n\n1. We propose a novel framework for rigorous deductive reasoning by introducing a \"**Natural Program**\" format (Fig. 1), which is suitable for verification and can be generated by just in-context learning;\n\n2. We show that reliable self-verification of long deductive reasoning processes written in our Natural Program format can be achieved through step-by-step subprocesses that only cover necessary context and premises;\n\n3. Experimentally, we demonstrate the superiority of our framework in improving the rigor, trustworthiness, and interpretability of LLM-generated reasoning steps and answers (Fig. 2).\n\n## 2 Related work\n\n**Reasoning with large language models.** Recent large language models (LLMs) [3; 8; 57; 47; 38; 18; 9; 37] have shown incredible ability in solving complex reasoning tasks. Instead of letting LLMs directly generate final answers as output, prior work have shown that by encouraging step-by-step reasoning through proper prompting, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting [50] and many others [21; 59; 58; 44; 48; 60; 25; 54], LLMs exhibit significantly better performance across diverse reasoning tasks. To further improve the step-by-step reasoning process, some recent studies have investigated leveraging external solvers such as program interpreters [39; 5; 27], training and calling external reasoning modules [11], or performing explicit search to generate deductive steps [2; 46]. Parallel to these works, we do not rely on external modules and algorithms, and we directly leverage the in-context learning ability of LLMs to generate more precise and rigorous deductive reasonings.\n\n**Large language models as verifiers.** Using language models to evaluate model generations has been a long standing idea [22; 36; 40; 4]. As LLMs exhibit impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, it becomes a natural idea to use LLMs as evaluation and verification tools. For example, [10; 11; 33] finetune LLMs to verify solutions and intermediate steps. LLMs aligned with RLHF [32; 31; 48] have also been employed to compare different model generations. In addition, recent works like [43; 52; 28; 6] leverage prompt designs to allow LLMs to self-verify, self-refine, and self-debug without the need for finetuning. However, these works do not focus on the rigor and trustworthiness of the deductive reasoning processes at every reasoning step. In this work, we propose a natural language-based deductive reasoning format that allows LLMs to self-verify _every_ intermediate step of a deductive reasoning process, thereby improving the rigor and trustfulness of reasoning.\n\nAdditionally, while some recent works [12; 53; 15; 34] have proposed methods to verify individual steps in a reasoning process, our approach distinguishes from these works in the following perspectives: **(1)** Our approach leverages in-context learning to achieve reasoning verification, without the need for language model finetuning. **(2)** Our Natural Program-based LLM verification approach not only identifies invalid reasoning steps, but also provides explicit explanations for why they are invalid, detailing the specific reasoning errors involved. **(3)** Our Natural Program-based reasoning and verification approach is compatible with in-context abstract reasoning tasks where reasoning steps do not possess proof-like entailment structures. For example, our approach is compatible with the Last Letters task, where the LLM is instructed to output the concatenation of the last letters of all words in a sequence as the final answer. **(4)** Our Natural Program approach allows the use of commonsense knowledge not explicitly listed in premises. For example, consider this problem: \"Marin eats 4 apples a day. How many apples does he eat in November?\" Even though \"November has 30 days\" is not explicitly listed in the premises, Natural Program permits the use of such common knowledge within a reasoning step. Our in-context verification process is also capable of handling these implicit premises (e.g., if LLM outputs \"November has 29 days\" in a reasoning step, it will be marked as invalid).\n\n## 3 Motivation and Problem Formulation\n\nA reasoning-based question-answering (QA) task can be defined as a tuple \\((Q,C,O,A)\\)[35], where \\(Q\\) is the target question; \\(C\\) is the context of a question, such as the necessary background for answering a question; \\(O=(o_{1},o_{2},\\cdots,c_{k})\\) are optional answer choices if \\(Q\\) is a K-way multiple choice problem; and \\(A\\) is the ground-truth answer. Given \\(Q\\) and \\(C\\) as inputs, large language models (LLMs) [3; 8; 47] generate a sequence of tokens \\(T=(t_{1},t_{2},\\cdots,t_{n})\\) to answer the question. Recent works like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [50; 21] leverage prompt engineering in the context \\(C\\) to encourage models to generate the intermediate reasoning process in \\(T\\), which benefits LLM performance across diverse reasoning tasks. In this case, \\(T\\) consists of a set of \\(m\\) intermediate reasoning steps, which we denote as \\(S=(s_{1},s_{2},\\cdots,s_{m})\\). Each step \\(s_{i}\\) can be represented by a subsequence of the generated tokens \\((t_{l_{i}},t_{r_{i}})\\subseteq T\\). In much prior work, a generated solution is \"correct\" if and only if the predicted final answer in \\(s_{m}\\) matches the ground truth \\(A\\), which we call **answer correct(ness)**.\n\nWe observe that for all cases where LLMs produce erroneous final answers, there exists at least one mistake among the intermediate reasoning steps \\(S\\). Moreover, even when the final answer is correct, there might still exist some mistakes among \\(S\\). This phenomenon, as illustrated in Tab. 1, occurs for all LLMs we tested, including state-of-the-art models such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 [32]. Since later reasoning steps are conditioned on prior reasoning steps, these mistakes often initiate a snowball effect, causing subsequent mistakes to compound. This significantly diminishes the likelihood of correct problem-solving and impedes the progress towards achieving human-level complex reasoning.\n\nTherefore, in this work, we place significant emphasis on ensuring the validity of _every_ reasoning step, not just the correctness of the final answer. In particular, we focus on the validity of _deductive reasoning_, an essential component of a logical reasoning process. In deductive reasoning, we are\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{p{341.4pt}} \\hline\n**Question**: Jerry is rolling a six-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than $3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row? \\\\\n**Ground Truth**: There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are _3/6 = 50\\%_. The chance of rolling one even number is 50\\%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is _50\\% * 50\\% = 25\\%_. The difference between these two probabilities is _50\\% - 25\\% = 25\\%_. **### 25\\%** \\\\ \\hline\n**Output**: There are two possible outcomes for rolling a number greater than 3 out of 6 total outcomes, so the probability is _2 /6 or 1 /3_. For rolling two even numbers in a row, there are three possible outcomes (2-4, 4-6, 6-2) out of 36 total outcomes, so the probability is _3 / 36 or 1 /12_. To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: _1/3 - 1/12 = 1/4_. This means that it is 25\\% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: An example question from GSM8K with a generated CoT reasoning path with GPT-3.5 (turbo), where the output provides a wrong reasoning chain with the correct answer.\n\ngiven a (premise, conclusion) pair, and we are interested in determining whether the conclusion follows from the premises. In the context of reasoning-based QA tasks, for each reasoning step \\(s_{i}\\), we define its _deductive validity_\\(V(s_{i})\\) as a binary variable. A reasoning step is **deductively valid** (\\(V(s_{i})=1\\)) if and only if \\(s_{i}\\) can be logically deduced from its corresponding premises \\(p_{i}\\), which consist of the context \\(C\\), the question \\(Q\\), and all the previous reasoning steps \\(s_{j}(j<i)\\). Then, we can also define the deductive validity for the entire reasoning chain \\(S\\) as \\(V(S)=\\wedge_{i=1}^{M}V(s_{i})\\). Compared to evaluating answer correctness, which can be accomplished by simple functions such as exact string match, evaluating deductive validity is a lot more challenging. Thanks to the recent progress on LLMs, which demonstrate impressive in-context learning capabilities across diverse scenarios, we propose to use LLMs to examine reasoning chains and predict the deductive reasoning validity.\n\n## 4 Deductively Verifiable Chain-of-Thought Reasoning\n\nIn this section, we introduce our specific approaches to performing deductive verification of reasoning chains. Specifically, we first introduce our motivation and method for decomposing a deductive verification process into a series of step-by-step processes, each only receiving contexts and premises that are necessary. Then, we propose **Natural Program**, a natural language-based deductive reasoning format, to facilitate local step-by-step verification. Finally, we show that by integrating deductive verification with unanimity-plurality voting, we can improve the trustworthiness of reasoning processes along with final answers. An overview of our approach is illustrated in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2.\n\n### Decomposition of Deductive Verification Process\n\nGiven a reasoning chain \\(S=(s_{1},s_{2},\\cdots,s_{n})\\), a straightforward idea to verify its deductive validity is to ask LLMs to examine the _entire_ reasoning chain at once. To assess the effectiveness of this approach, we conduct a preliminary experiment: for a dataset problem and its reasoning chain \\(S\\) generated by ChatGPT, we prompt ChatGPT with \"Do you think the above reasoning process is correct? Let's think step by step\" such that its outputs whether there exists any mistake among any reasoning step in \\(S\\). However, as demonstrated in Tab. 2, the verification accuracy is 50% for most datasets, and ChatGPT struggles at finding out mistaken reasonings. Notably, it persistently outputs \"Correct\" for most reasoning chain queries, regardless of their actual validity.\n\nWe conjecture that such phenomenon is caused by the abundance of irrelevant premises for each reasoning step. Recall that the premises \\(p_{i}\\) for a reasoning step \\(s_{i}\\) consist of the the question \\(Q\\), the question context \\(C\\), along with the prior reasoning steps \\(s_{\\leq j}=\\{s_{j}:j<i\\}\\). For \\(Q\\) and \\(C\\), we can further extract and decompose \\(Q\\cup C\\) into a set of \"question-related premises\" \\(QC=\\{qc_{1},qc_{2},\\cdots,qc_{m}\\}\\), where \\(qc_{i}\\) is a premise or condition inferred from \\(Q\\cup C\\). Then, it is often the case that most elements of \\(p_{i}=QC\\cup s_{\\leq j}\\) are irrelevant to the validity of \\(s_{i}\\), leading to erroneous verifications from language models. A very recent work [41] also observes a similar phenomenon where LLMs are easily distracted by irrelevant context.\n\nHence, we propose a decomposition of the reasoning chain verification process into a series of step-by-step processes, where each step only considers the premises that are _necessary_. The overall validity\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c} \\hline \\hline Prompting & Reasoning Correctness & GSM8K & AQuA & MATH & AddSub & Date & Last Letters \\\\ \\hline \\multirow{3}{*}{Zero-shot} & Correct & 0.98 & 0.96 & 1.00 & 0.98 & 0.98 & 1.00 \\\\  & Incorrect & 0.04 & 0.06 & 0.04 & 0.02 & 0.04 & 0.04 \\\\  & (Average) & 0.51 & 0.51 & 0.52 & 0.50 & 0.51 & 0.52 \\\\ \\hline \\multirow{3}{*}{Two-shot} & Correct & 0.98 & 0.96 & 1.00 & 0.92 & 1.00 & 0.96 \\\\  & Incorrect & 0.02 & 0.04 & 0.00 & 0.06 & 0.26 & 0.06 \\\\  & (Average) & 0.50 & 0.50 & 0.50 & 0.49 & 0.63 & 0.51 \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 2: Zero-shot and two-shot reasoning chain verification accuracy for GPT-3.5-turbo (ChatGPT), where an entire reasoning chain is verified at once. The two shot prompt we used is presented in Appendix D.1. To generate verification inputs, for each dataset, we perform Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and randomly sample 50 reasoning chains that are valid and 50 reasoning chains that exhibit mistakes. We observe that when given an _entire_ reasoning process, where the deductive graphs for all reasoning steps are entangled together, it is challenging even for strong language models like ChatGPT to verify its validity.\n\nof the reasoning chain, denoted as \\(V(S)=\\wedge_{i=1}^{M}V(s_{i})\\), can be naturally decomposed into individual step validity \\(V(s_{i})\\). However, achieving such decomposition is highly challenging without imposing constraints on the format of reasoning chains. Additionally, for each \\(s_{i}\\in S\\), we aim to ensure that it _explicitly_ lists the minimal subset of premises \\(\\bar{p}_{i}\\subseteq p_{i}\\) required for deductive reasoning to avoid potential ambiguities during verification. This motivates us to introduce a natural-language-based deductive reasoning format in Section 4.2.\n\n### Natural Program Deductive Reasoning Format\n\nAs previously mentioned in Sec. 4.1, we desire LLMs to output deductive reasoning processes that can be easily verified by themselves, specifically by listing out the minimal set of necessary premises \\(p_{i}\\) at each reasoning step \\(s_{i}\\). To accomplish its goal, we propose to leverage the power of natural language, which is capable of rigorously representing a large variety of reasoning processes and can be generated with minimal effort. In particular, we introduce **Natural Program**, a novel deductive reasoning format for LLMs. More formally, Natural Program consists of the following components:\n\n* An instruction for models to extract question-related premises \\(QC\\). We use the following instruction: \"First, let's write down all the statements and relationships in the question with labels\".\n* A numbered-list of question-related premises, each prefixed with \"#{premise_number}\".\n* An instruction for models to generate the reasoning chain \\(S\\) based on the question-related premises \\(QC\\). We use the following instruction: \"Next, let's answer the question step by step with reference to the question and reasoning process\".\n* A list of prefixed reasoning steps \\(S_{i}\\). The prefix has the following format: #{number} (by {list_of_premises_used}). Here \"number\" equals \\(|QC|+i\\), and \"list of_premises_used\" consists of numbers from the smallest subset of premises among \\(QC\\cup s_{\\leq j}\\) that are used for the deductive reasoning of \\(s_{i}\\). In addition, for the last reasoning step \\(s_{m}\\), we ensure that it (1) includes a special tag Final Step; (2) refers to the premise number of the target question to be answered; (3) explicitly gives the final answer to a question.\n\nTo encourage language models to reason in the Natural Program format, we have designed one-shot prompts for different datasets, which are shown Appendix D.2. Given that LLM's reasoning outputs follow the Natural Program format, we can then verify the deductive validity of a _single_ reasoning step \\(s_{i}\\) through an instruction that consists of (1) the full descriptions of premises used for the reasoning of \\(s_{i}\\); (2) the full description of \\(s_{i}\\); (3) an instruction for validity verification, such as \"Double-check the reasoning process, let's analyze its correctness, and end with \"yes\" or \"no\".\" Note that throughout this verification process, we only retain the minimal necessary premise and context for \\(s_{i}\\), thereby avoiding irrelevant context distraction and significantly improving the effectiveness of validation. Additionally, we employ a one-shot prompt for this verification process, which we find very helpful for improving the verification accuracy. The prompt is shown in Appendix D.3.\n\nFigure 1 provides an overview of the complete Natural Program-based deductive reasoning and verification process. By using the Natural Program approach, we demonstrate that LLMs are capable of performing explicit, rigorous, and coherent deductive reasoning. Furthermore, Natural Program enables LLMs to self-verify their reasoning processes more effectively, enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of the generated responses.\n\n### Integrating Deductive Verification with Unanimity-Plurality Voting\n\nGiven that we can _effectively_ verify a deductive reasoning process, we can naturally integrate verification with LLM's sequence generation strategies to enhance the trustworthiness of both the intermediate reasoning steps and the final answers. In this work, we propose Unanimity-Plurality Voting, a 2-phase sequence generation strategy described as follows. Firstly, similar to prior work like [48], we sample \\(k\\) reasoning chain candidates along with their final answers. In the unanimity phase, we perform deductive validation on each reasoning chain. Recall that a chain \\(S\\) is valid (i.e., \\(V(S)=1\\)) if and only if all of its intermediate reasoning steps are valid (i.e., \\(\\forall i,V(s_{i})=1\\)). For _each_ intermediate reasoning step \\(s_{i}\\), we perform majority voting over \\(k^{\\prime}\\) sampled single-step validity predictions to determine its final validity \\(V(s_{i})\\). We then only retain the verified chain candidates \\(\\{S:V(S)=1\\}\\). In the plurality voting stage, we conduct a majority-based voting among the verified chain candidates to determine the final answer. This voting process ensures that the final answer is selected based on a consensus among the trustworthy reasoning chains.\n\n## 5 Experiments\n\nIn this section, we perform evaluations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our Natural Program-based deductive reasoning verification approach over diverse reasoning datasets. Firstly, we show that our deductive verification process leads to substantial improvements in the rigor and reliability of reasoning chains. Subsequently, we will examine the impact of deductive verification on the accuracy of final answers. Our findings reveal that by adopting our Natural Program reasoning format without verification, we improve answer correctness on challenging benchmarks. Further applying deductive verification leads to slight reductions in final answer accuracy. One reason for this phenomenon is that the verification process effectively identifies and eliminates flawed reasoning chains that still produce correct answers.\n\n### Experimental Setup\n\n**Benchmarks.** We evaluate the deductive verification accuracy and the answer correctness of reasoning chains over a diverse set of reasoning tasks: arithmetic reasoning, symbol manipulation, and date understanding. For arithmetic reasoning, we utilize the following benchmarks: 1) AddSub [19]; 2) GSM8K [10]; 3) MATH [17]; 4) AQuA [24]. Among these benchmarks, the AddSub and GSM8K datasets involve middle school-level multi-step calculations to arrive at a single number as the final answer. The MATH dataset presents more challenging problems that require expressing the answer as a mathematical expression in LaTeX format. These problems involve concepts from linear algebra, algebra, geometry, calculus, statistics, and number theory. AQuA also features similarly challenging problems, except that questions are in a multiple-choice format. For symbol manipulation, we use Last Letter Concatenation [50], where the model is tasked with concatenate the last letters of all the words provided in the question. For date understanding, we use the one from BIG-bench [45]\n\n**Deductive verification evaluation setup.** For each of the above benchmarks, we select 100 reasoning chains, where 50 of them are deductively valid and 50 of them exhibit reasoning mistakes. The ground-truth deductive validity of each reasoning chain is determined by human annotators.\n\n**Answer extraction.** To extract answers from reasoning solutions, we first perform text splitting based on answer prefix patterns such as \"answer is\" or \"option is\". Then, using problem type-specific regular expressions, we extract the final answer. To extract the validity results from deductive verification processes, we only keep the last sentence of model response. We then extract the validity answer with regular expressions to obtain attitude words, e.g., \"yes\" or \"no\", to determine the validity answer. Sometimes, language models may not provide a direct answer and instead output phrases like \"not applicable\" at the end of the response. In such cases, we consider the answer from the model as \"yes\". Please refer to Appendix C for more details.\n\n**Model and Hyperparameters.** We conduct our main experiments with GPT-3.5-turbo (Chat-GPT) [32]. We also present results for the LLama model-family [47]) in Appendix A, where we find the deductive verification accuracy to be worse than larger models even after finetuning. For ChatGPT, we use a generation temperature of \\(T=0.7\\). For Unanimity-Plurality Voting, we set \\(k=10\\) and \\(k^{\\prime}=3\\) by default. We use 1-shot prompting for both reasoning chain generation and deductive verification (except reasoning chain generation for the date understanding task where we use 2-shot). See Appendix D.2 and Appendix D.3 for more details.\n\n### Comparison of Deductive Verification Accuracy\n\nWe compare the verification accuracy of reasoning chains using two methods: (1) verifying the entire reasoning chain at once (as described in Section 4.1) without utilizing the Natural Program, and (2) our Natural Program-based verification approach with step-by-step decomposition. The results, presented in Table 3, indicate that our approach achieves significantly higher reasoning verification accuracy across most datasets. It effectively identifies erroneous reasoning in faulty chains while maintaining a low rate of false positives for valid chains. However, we observe that our approach's effectiveness is limited on the \"Last Letters\" task. We hypothesize that this is due to the task's nature, where each subsequent reasoning step is conditioned on _all_ previous steps, presenting greater challenges for reasoning verification due to the increased dependency among premises.\n\n### Impact of Natural Program and Deductive Verification on Final Answer Correctness\n\nWe then investigate the impact of our Natural Program reasoning format and our deductive verification process on final answer correctness. We conduct two experiments: (1) for each problem, we instruct language models to generate \\(k=10\\) reasoning chain candidates in the Natural Program (NP) format and perform simple majority voting on final answers, _without_ using deductive verification to filter out reasoning chain candidates; (2) applying our deductive verification approach to filter out reasoning chain candidates, and apply Unanimity-Plurality Voting (UPV) along the process to determine the final answer. As a reference, we also report the performance of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [50] and Faithful CoT [27]. For these baselines, we perform simple answer-based majority voting with \\(k=10\\) for fair comparison.\n\nResults are presented in Tab. 4. While our major goal is to improve the trustworthiness and reliability of deductive reasoning, we find that prompting language models to reason in our Natural Program format achieves on-par or better final answer accuracy than baselines over many reasoning tasks. Upon further applying our deductive verification approach to filter out invalid reasoning chains, we observe a slight decrease in final answer accuracy. One major contributing factor to this decrease is the filtering out of reasoning chain candidates that provide correct answers but exhibit incorrect reasoning. We illustrate an example in Table 5, where ChatGPT generates the correct final answer but assigns incorrect premise numbers to support the first reasoning step. We note that in many such cases, our approach effectively identifies these reasoning errors, thereby enhancing the rigor and\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c} \\hline \\hline  & \\multicolumn{4}{c}{Arithmetic} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Commonsense} \\\\ \\cline{2-7} Methods & GSM8K & AQuA & MATH\\({}^{*}\\) & AddSub & Date & Last Letters \\\\ \\hline CoT + Voting & **87.62\\%** & 70.18\\% & 35.93\\% & 92.36\\% & 69.97\\% & 81.60\\% \\\\ Faithful CoT + Voting & 75.80\\% & 61.80\\% & 31.78\\% & 88.35\\%\\({}^{1}\\) & **73.50\\%** & - \\\\ \\hline Ours (Natural Program (NP), No Verification) & 87.05\\% & **70.34\\%** & **36.75\\%** & **93.67\\%** & 72.49\\% & **92.98\\%** \\\\ Ours (NP + Deductive Verification + UPV) & 86.01\\% & 69.49\\% & 36.48\\% & 93.54\\% & 71.45\\% & 92.60\\% \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 4: Final answer accuracy comparison on GPT-3.5-turbo (ChatGPT).

In the latter case, when we verify each reasoning step \\(s_{i}\\), we only keep the necessary subset of premises \\(\\bar{p_{i}}\\subseteq p_{i}\\). To calculate verification accuracy, for each dataset, we randomly sample 50 reasoning chains that are deductively valid and 50 reasoning steps exhibiting incorrect reasonings.\n\nreliability of the language models' reasoning processes, albeit with a slight negative impact on the overall final answer correctness. Further discussions are presented in Appendix B.\n\n### Ablation Study\n\nIn addition, we perform several ablation studies to gain further insights into the designs of our deductive verification approach. In Tab. 6, we compare two different approaches to verify a single reasoning step \\(s_{i}\\in S\\) following our Natural Program format. The first approach utilizes all premises \\(p_{i}=QC\\cup S_{\\leq j}\\) for verification regardless of their relevance to \\(s_{i}\\), potentially introducing irrelevant contexts. The second approach follows our design in Sec. 4.1 and only includes the necessary context and premises \\(\\bar{p_{i}}\\subseteq p_{i}\\). We observe that removing irrelevant premises significantly improves the reasoning chain verification accuracy on many datasets, highlighting the importance of this technique.\n\nWe also ablate on our Unanimity-Plurality Voting strategy by investigating the impact of different \\(k^{\\prime}\\). Recall that \\(k^{\\prime}\\) determines the number of votes to produce validity predictions of single-step reasoning. Results are shown in Tab. 7. We observe that increasing \\(k^{\\prime}\\) generally enhances reasoning validation accuracy, though we note that this is at the expense of more compute.\n\n## 6 Limitations\n\nWhile we have demonstrated the effectiveness of Natural Program-based deductive reasoning verification to enhance the trustworthiness and interpretability of reasoning steps and final answers, it is\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c|c c c c c c c|c} \\hline \\hline Premise Context & \\# Shots & Reasoning Correctness & GSM8K & AQuA & MATH & AdSub & Date & Last Letters & Average \\\\ \\hline \\multirow{2}{*}{Full Premises} & \\multirow{2}{*}{1} & Correct & 64\\% & 54\\% & 58\\% & 95\\% & 26\\% & 96\\% & 66\\% \\\\  & & Wrong & 56\\% & 68\\% & 56\\% & 24\\% & 76\\% & 5\\% & 48\\% \\\\  & & (Average) & 60\\% & 61\\% & 57\\% & 60\\% & 51\\% & 51\\% & 57\\% \\\\ \\hline \\multirow{3}{*}{Minimal Premises} & \\multirow{3}{*}{0} & Correct & 84\\% & 78\\% & 90\\% & 96\\% & 90\\% & 12\\% & 75\\% \\\\  & & Wrong & 26\\% & 12\\% & 28\\% & 20\\% & 20\\% & 80\\% & 31\\% \\\\  & & (Average) & 55\\% & 45\\% & 59\\% & 58\\% & 55\\% & 46\\% & 53\\% \\\\ \\hline \\multirow{3}{*}{Minimal Premises} & \\multirow{3}{*}{1} & Correct & 84\\% & 72\\% & 70\\% & 95\\% & 90\\% & 96\\% & 85\\% \\\\  & & Wrong & 84\\% & 62\\% & 76\\% & 40\\% & 56\\% & 6\\% & 54\\% \\\\ \\cline{1-1}  & & (Average) & **84\\%** & **67\\%** & **73\\%** & **68\\%** & **73\\%** & 51\\% & **69\\%** \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 6: Ablation study on the impact of (1) premise context and (2) zero-shot vs. few-shot scenarios on deductive verification accuracy using our Natural Program-based approach with step-by-step reasoning chain decomposition. To verify each reasoning step \\(s_{i}\\), we either the full premises \\(p_{i}=QC\\cup S_{\\leq j}\\), or use the minimal subset of premises \\(\\bar{p_{i}}\\subseteq p_{i}\\) necessary as outlined in Sec. 4.1 The one-shot prompt we used is shown in Appendix D.3. For each dataset, we randomly sample 50 reasoning chains that are deductively valid and 50 reasoning steps exhibiting incorrect reasonings.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l} \\hline \\hline\n**Question: In March it rained 0.81 inches.

In \u201cStep 1\u201d, the correct premise numbers should be #1 and #2. Our deductive reasoning verification approach effectively identifies these reasoning errors, enhancing the rigor and trustworthiness of the reasoning process. It is worth noting that removing a correct answer from the candidate reasoning chains has a slightly negative impact on the overall final answer correctness.\n\nimportant to acknowledge that our approach has limitations. In this section, we analyze a common source of failure cases to gain deeper insights into the behaviors of our approach. The failure case, as shown in Tab. 8, involves the ambiguous interpretation of the term \"pennies,\" which can be understood as either a type of coin or a unit of currency depending on the context. The ground truth answer interprets \"pennies\" as coins, while ChatGPT interprets it as a unit of currency. In this case, our deductive verification process is incapable of finding such misinterpretations. Contextual ambiguities like this are common in real-world scenarios, highlighting the current limitation of our approach.\n\n## 7 Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we aim to enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform explicit and rigorous deductive reasoning while ensuring the trustworthiness of their reasoning processes through self-verification. To this end, we have proposed a novel framework based on \"Natural Program\", a natural language-based deductive reasoning format that facilitates reasoning verification and can be easily generated through in-context learning. Within this framework, we decompose the verification process of complex reasoning chains into step-by-step subprocesses that focus solely on necessary context and premises, allowing us to significantly enhance the accuracy of verification. Additionally, we introduce a Unanimity-Plurality Voting strategy to further improve verification accuracy. Experimentally, we demonstrate the superiority of our framework in improving the rigor, trustworthiness, and interpretability of reasoning steps and answers.\n\n**Broader Impact.** While our deductive verification approach can mitigate hallucinations and reasoning errors of Large Language Models (LLMs), it does not completely eliminate these phenomena. LLMs can still produce harmful and biased content, make incorrect claims, and produce wrongful advice. This issue becomes particularly significant when LLMs engage in complex reasoning chains, increasing the risk of misleading users. Consequently, it is still crucial for users to exercise great caution when interacting with, deploying, or developing LLM-based applications.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe would like to express our sincere gratitude to Tongzhou Mu and Caiwei Xiao from UC San Diego, Kairoo Luo from Tsinghua University, and Pulkit Madan, Reza Pourreza, Sunny Panchal, and Apratim Bhattacharyya from Qualcomm for their valuable discussions and feedback.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} \\hline \\hline Answer Correctness & \\(k^{\\prime}=1\\) & \\(k^{\\prime}=3\\) & \\(k^{\\prime}=5\\) & \\(k^{\\prime}=10\\) \\\\ \\hline Correct & 86\\% & 90\\% & 90\\% & 92\\% \\\\ \\hline Wrong & 38\\% & 38\\% & 38\\% & 40\\% \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 7: Ablation of different values of \\(k^{\\prime}\\) on the verification accuracy of reasoning chains using our Unanimity-Plurality Voting strategy.

The term \"pennies\" in this question can be interpreted as either a type of coin or a unit of currency. In this particular question, \"pennies\" is treated as a type of coin. However, the initial reasoning step by ChatGPT mistakenly treats \"pennies\" as a unit of currency, resulting in the conversion of all Melanie\u2019s money into \"pennies\" (highlighted in red). Consequently, all subsequent reasoning steps follow this flawed logic, leading to an incorrect reasoning trace. Our deductive verification is not yet able to detect such errors.\n\n## References\n\n* [1] Kushal Arora, Layla El Asri, Hareesh Bahuleyan, and Jackie Chi Kit Cheung.

We select two popular models: Vicuna-7B and Vicuna-13B [7]. These models are fine-tuned versions of LLaMA-7B and LLaMA-13B [47] using the ShareGPT data3. We use the same Natural Program-based one-shot verification method we used in the main paper. Results are shown in the first and the third rows of Table 9. We observe for the _original Vicuna models without finetuning_, Vicuna-7B exhibits poor performance in deductive verification and fails to find out reasoning mistakes, while the larger Vicuna-13B exhibits better verification accuracy.\n\nFootnote 3: [https://github.com/domeccleston/sharegpt](https://github.com/domeccleston/sharegpt)\n\nWe therefore conduct an additional experiment to investigate if the verification accuracy of Vicuna models can be improved by fine-tuning. To this end, we generate a deductive verification dataset, which consists of 2000 reasoning steps evenly distributed between correct and incorrect categories. We automatically generate this dataset using GPT-3.5-turbo since it exhibits a very high accuracy of single-step verification. We first use GPT-3.5-turbo to generate solutions for problems in GSM8K's training set. We then execute step-by-step deductive verification on these solutions using GPT-3.5-turbo. For solutions that result in correct final answers, we retain the reasoning steps that pass deductive verification. For solutions that yield incorrect final answers, we retain the reasoning steps that cannot pass deductive verification. After constructing our dataset, we then fine-tune the Vicuna models using the verifications of the 2000 reasoning steps. Models were fine-tuned with 4 A100-80GB over 3 epochs. Training parameters are shown in Table 10.\n\nAs shown in Tab. 9, we observe that fine-tuning with our dataset can enhance the deductive verification accuracy of Vicuna models not only on the dataset where the training dataset is constructed (GSM8K), but also on many other datasets. However, the accuracy is still worse than non-finetuned GPT-3.5, which suggests that model capacity has a significant impact on deductive verification capabilities.\n\nAppendix B More Discussion on Improvements of Deductive Verification Accuracy Versus Improvements on Final Answer Correctness\n\nIn the main paper, we demonstrated that our verification approach significantly improves the verification accuracy of reasoning chains (Tab. 3, 6, but barely improves the final answer accuracy (Tab. 4). We further analyze this phenomenon below:\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c|c c c c c c|c} \\hline \\hline Models & Reasoning Correctness & GSM8K & AQuA & MATH & AddSub & Date & Last Letters & Overall \\\\ \\hline \\multirow{3}{*}{Vicuna-7B} & Correct & 80\\% & 86\\% & 96\\% & 98\\% & 96\\% & 80\\% & 89\\% \\\\  & Wrong & 14\\% & 22\\% & 16\\% & 6\\% & 20\\% & 34\\% & 19\\% \\\\  & (Average) & 47\\% & 54\\% & 56\\% & 52\\% & 58\\% & 57\\% & 54\\% \\\\ \\hline \\multirow{3}{*}{\\begin{tabular}{c} Vicuna-7B \\\\ (fine-tuned) \\\\ \\end{tabular} } & Correct & 68\\% & 48\\% & 46\\% & 76\\% & 46\\% & 32\\% & 53\\% \\\\  & Wrong & 72\\% & 86\\% & 54\\% & 60\\% & 72\\% & 68\\% & 69\\% \\\\  & (Average) & 70\\% & **67\\%** & 50\\% & 68\\% & 61\\% & 50\\% & 61\\% \\\\ \\hline \\multirow{3}{*}{\\begin{tabular}{c} Vicuna-13B \\\\ (fine-tuned) \\\\ \\end{tabular} } & Correct & 86\\% & 82\\% & 92\\% & 96\\% & 72\\% & 74\\% & 84\\% \\\\  & Wrong & 32\\% & 36\\% & 20\\% & 20\\% & 34\\% & 30\\% & 29\\% \\\\  & (Average) & 59\\% & 59\\% & 56\\% & 58\\% & 53\\% & 52\\% & 57\\% \\\\ \\hline \\multirow{3}{*}{\\begin{tabular}{c} Vicuna-13B \\\\ (fine-tuned) \\\\ \\end{tabular} } & Correct & 74\\% & 50\\% & 56\\% & 86\\% & 72\\% & 12\\% & 58\\% \\\\  & Wrong & 72\\% & 76\\% & 72\\% & 68\\% & 62\\% & 96\\% & 74\\% \\\\  & (Average) & **73\\%** & 63\\% & **64\\%** & **77\\%** & **67\\%** & **54\\%** & **66\\%** \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\multirow{3}{*}{\n\\begin{tabular}{c} ChatGPT \\\\ (GPT-3.5-Turbo) \\\\ \\end{tabular} } & Correct & 84\\% & 72\\% & 70\\% & 95\\% & 90\\% & 96\\% & 85\\% \\\\  & Wrong & 84\\% & 62\\% & 76\\% & 40\\% & 56\\% & 6\\% & 54\\% \\\\ \\cline{1-1}  & (Average) & 84\\% & 67\\% & 73\\% & 68\\% & 73\\% & 51\\% & 69\\% \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 9: One-shot Deductive Verification Accuracy of Vicuna-7B and Vicuna-13B. The models are evaluated with or without finetuning on our deductive verification dataset. For each dataset, we randomly sample 50 reasoning chains that are deductively valid and 50 reasoning steps exhibiting incorrect reasonings.\n\nConsider the GSM8K dataset as an example (recall that the final answer for a problem is obtained through majority voting). Among all problems, 91.6% of problems have \\(|\\)(number of votes received by the correct answer) \\(-\\) (largest number of votes received by a single wrong answer)\\(|>2\\), and their final answers are unlikely to be changed through our deductive verification approach. For the rest of the cases (8.4%), where deductive verification is more likely to impact their final answers, we found that:\n\n* Among all reasoning chains that arrive at correct answers (these correct-answer chains account for 49.4% of all reasoning chain candidates), 46.2% of reasoning chains are filtered out by our verification process.\n* Among the reasoning chains that arrive at correct answer but are filtered out by our verification process, 76.3% indeed exhibit incorrect reasoning.\n* Among the reasoning chains that arrive at correct answer and are not filtered out by our verification process, 78.0% indeed have correct reasonings.\n* Among the reasoning chains that do not arrive at correct answer and exhibit incorrect reasonings (these account for 50.6% of all reasoning chain candidates), 40.6% are filtered out by our verification process.\n\nThe above statistics shows that a significant portion of reasoning chains that arrive at correct answers but exhibit incorrect reasoning are successfully eliminated. Therefore, the reliability and trustfulness of reasoning chains that arrive at the correct answers are significantly improved. Combined with the fact that a significant proportion of reasoning chains that exhibit incorrect answers are eliminated, and that our approach's verification accuracy significantly improves over naive verification approaches, our primary goal to improve LLM reasoning reliability is accomplished.\n\nNevertheless, the removals of many reasoning chains yielding correct answers (specifically, a significant 46.2% \\(\\times\\) 49.4% of all chains) has a notable impact. This even exceeds the removals of reasoning chains with incorrect reasonings and answers (40.6% \\(\\times\\) 50.6% of all chains). As a result, there are fewer votes for the correct answer when generating final answers through majority voting, which limits the final answer accuracy. In the future, we believe that when a greater proportion of incorrect reasoning chains with incorrect answers are filtered out, we can improve the final answer accuracy.\n\n## Appendix C More Details on Answer Extraction\n\nIn this section, we describe our process to extract the final answer from language models' responses. The process begins by selecting the last three non-empty lines. Then, these lines are processed through the following pipeline:\n\n1. Firstly, we use a list of regular expressions to identify \"No-Answer\" patterns within the text, such as \"we cannot answer (thislthe) question\". This process helps us ascertain whether the model can provide a conclusive answer. If any such patterns appear in the text, we mark \"No answer!\" as the final answer. However, if we don't detect these patterns, we proceed to the next steps for extracting the final answer.\n2. Secondly, if any \"Answer-Split\" patterns are found in the text, we divide the text into several blocks using the identified pattern. The last block of text is then utilized for extracting the answer.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{r|c} \\hline \\hline Hyperparameters & Value \\\\ \\hline Optimizer & AdamW \\\\ Learning rate & \\(1\\times 10^{-5}\\) \\\\ Weight decay & 0.00 \\\\ Num epochs & 3 \\\\ Batch size & 64 \\\\ Learning rate schedule & Linear \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 10: Hyperparameters for finetuning Vicuna models with our deductive verification dataset.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:17]\n\nIn Tab. 18, we demonstrate that the language model (ChatGPT) not only successfully identifies ungrounded information, but also identifies logical errors within the given solutions.\n\nIn Tab. 19, we illustrate a case where the language model fails to detect ungrounded premise numbers, mistakenly assuming that these numbers can be derived from grounded ones.\n\nLastly, in Tab. 20, we illustrate a case where the language model is sometimes unable to correctly identify grounded numbers.\n\n**Here is a math question and its solution:**\n\n\"Question:\n\nJason had 20 lollipops. He gave Denny some lollipops. Now Jason has 12 lollipops. How many lollipops did Jason give to Denny?\n\nAnswer:\n\nJason started with 20 lollipops. Then he had 12 after giving some to Denny. So he gave Denny 20 + 12 =34. The answer is 34.\"\n\nYou are a math teacher. Do you think the reasoning process is correct?\n\nLet's check the \"Answer\" step by step, and then end with \"yes\" or \"no\".\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe problem statement is clear, but the reasoning process has a major error in it.\n\nLet's go through it step by step:\n\n1. \"Jason started with 20 lollipops.\" This is correct according to the problem statement.\n2. \"Then he had 12 after giving some to Denny.\" This is also correct as per the problem.\n3. \"So he gave Denny 20 + 12 =34. The answer is 34.\" This is incorrect. The correct reasoning process should be subtracting the number of lollipops he ended up with from the number he started with. That would be 20 - 12 = 8 lollipops.\n\nSo, Jason gave Denny 8 lollipops, not 34. No, the reasoning process is incorrect.\n\n**Here is a math question and its solution:**\n\n\"Question:\n\nOlivia has $23. She bought five bagels for $3 each. How much money does she have left?\n\nAnswer:\n\nOlivia had 23 dollars. 5 bagels for 3 dollars each will be 5 x 3 = 15 dollars. So she has 23 - 15 dollars left.\n\n23 - 15 is 8. The answer is 8.\"\n\nYou are a math teacher. Do you think the reasoning process is correct?\n\nLet's check the \"Answer\" step by step, and then end with \"yes\" or \"no\".\n\n**Answer:**\n\nLet's go through this reasoning process step by step.\n\n1. \"Olivia had 23 dollars.\" This is the given starting amount of money that Olivia has. This step is correct.\n\n2. \"5 bagels for 3 dollars each will be 5 x 3 = 15 dollars.\" This is correct as well. Olivia spends 3 dollars for each bagel, and she buys 5 of them. So the total cost of the bagels is 3 dollars/bagel x 5 bagels = 15 dollars.\n\n3. \"So she has 23 - 15 dollars left.\" This statement is also correct. After purchasing the bagels, Olivia will have her initial amount of money minus the cost of the bagels.\n\n4. \"23 - 15 is 8. The answer is 8.\" This step is correct as well. 23 dollars (Olivia's initial amount) - 15 dollars (the cost of the bagels) = 8 dollars. This means that Olivia has 8 dollars left after buying the bagels.\n\nSo overall, Olivia has 8 dollars left after buying five bagels for 3 dollars each. Yes, the reasoning process is correct.\n\nTable 12: Two-shot prompt for direct reasoning chain verification without Natural Program format.\n\n**Question:**\n\nAlice buys 5 apples.

Generating unfactual texts\nnot only leads to lower performances but also\ndegrades the trust and validity of their applications. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting\nimproves trust and model performance on complex reasoning tasks by generating interpretable\nreasoning chains, but still suffers from factuality concerns in knowledge-intensive tasks.\nIn this paper, we propose the Verify-and-Edit\nframework for CoT prompting, which seeks to\nincrease prediction factuality by post-editing\nreasoning chains according to external knowledge. Building on top of GPT-3, our framework lead to accuracy improvements in multiple open-domain question-answering tasks.\nFor reproducing our results and extending the\nframework further, we make our codebase available at https://github.com/RuochenZhao/Verifyand-Edit\n1\nIntroduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have become the\nnew norm in many downstream NLP tasks. In\nutilizing these LLMs, Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\nprompting (Wei et al., 2022) is found to improve\nperformances for tasks that require complex reasoning, such as math word problems, commonsense\nreasoning, and symbolic manipulation. At the same\ntime, it is able to generate interpretable reasoning\nchains. Recent work further explored how to use\nthese reasoning chains to select better predictions.\nHowever, the primary focus of these methods has\nbeen to improve end-task performance by utilizing generated CoTs as-is. For example, Ye and\n\u2217Equal contribution.\n\u2020Xingxuan Li is under the Joint Ph.D. Program between\nAlibaba and Nanyang Technological University.\n\u2021Work done when the author was on leave from NTU.\nStandard\nQuestion\nChain-of-thought\nSelf-Consistency: \nless than majority agree\nVerify\nExternal Knowledge Retrieval\nEdit Rationales\nNew Prediction\nOf all the teams\nJohn \nNyskohus\nplayed for, which\nteam was known\nas \"the Black and\nWhites?\"\nNewcastle United.\nFirst, John Nyskohus played for the Norwegian\nfootball team Odd Grenland. Second, Odd\nGrenland \nis \nknown \nas \n\"the \nBlack \nand\nWhites.\" The answer is Odd Grenland.\nWhat team did John Nyskohus play for? \nWhat team is known as \"the Black and Whites?\" \nJohn Nyskohus ... is an Australian former soccer player who played club football for\nUSC Lion ... and Adelaide City in the National Soccer League ... \nAdelaide City Football Club is an Australian football (soccer) club based in Adelaide,\nSouth Australia. They are also known as \"The Zebras\" and \"the Black and Whites. \nFirst, John Nyskohus played for Adelaide City in\nthe National Soccer League. Second, Adelaide\nCity Football Club is known as \"the Black and\nWhites\". \nThe answer is\nAdelaide City Football\nClub.\nFigure 1: The Verify-and-Edit framework consists of\nfive steps: (1) pass predictions with lower-than-average\nconsistency to the next stages while leaving highly consistent predictions as-is; (2) produce verifying questions;\n(3) retrieve external knowledge; (4) edit rationales with\ninformed answers; and (5) produce new predictions.\nDurrett (2022) train a calibrator that tunes prediction probabilities based on rationale scores; Wang\net al. (2022) sample multiple reasoning paths to find\nthe most common (consistent) prediction. Only a\nfew, such as Creswell et al. (2022) and Zhou et al.\n(2022), have explored ways to improve the quality\nof CoTs themselves.\nIn fact, improving the CoT quality could be beneficial in enhancing both interpretability and endtask performance. Ye and Durrett (2022) point out\nthat explanations judged as good by humans often indicate more accurate predictions. Intuitively,\na better set of CoT prompts could provide better\ngrounding and logically consistent thought processes, thus leading to more accurate predictions.\nTo improve generation quality, one important\naspect is factual correctness, which is currently\n5823\n\fone of the most fatal drawbacks of LLMs (OpenAIBlog, 2022; Zhao et al., 2023). In answering user\nqueries, LLMs such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020)\ntend to make up facts and details, which is now\nflagged as a primary warning in their API usage.\nAs a major use case of LLMs is the prospect of\nreplacing traditional search engines and usage for\nmore direct information access through questionanswering, factuality concerns could largely undermine their validity and degrade users\u2019 level of\ntrust (Marcus, 2022). Fixing this issue is challenging and the concerns still persist even after the\nmodels are instruction-tuned with human feedback\n(Ouyang et al., 2022). This is because the source\nof truth can be unavailable during the finetuning\nprocess (OpenAI-Blog, 2022).\nThus, it is of urgent concern to better control the\ngeneration and increase the factual correctness of\npredictions. As LLMs could fail to recall accurate\ndetails when functioning as a knowledge base (Ye\nand Durrett, 2022; Creswell et al., 2022), if possible, knowledge from external sources could be\nintroduced as assistance. Assisted thought process\nis also common in human reasoning: when humans\nanswer questions, they often search (or revisit) external knowledge sources for supporting facts in\norder to refresh their (internal) memory.\nInspired by this, in this work we propose a\nVerify-and-Edit (VE) framework to post-edit the\nreasoning chains for more factually aligned predictions. As shown in Fig. 1, we first select uncertain\ninstances to edit, which have a less-than-majorityagree consistency. These instances, as implied\nby Wang et al. (2022), often consist of plausiblesounding statements, such as the sentence \u201cJohn\nNyskohus played for the Norweigian football team\nOdd Greenland\" in Fig. 1. When editing, we first\ngenerate a question to verify this detail, such as\n\u201cWhat team did John Nyskohus play for?\u201d Then,\nto answer this query, we introduce external knowledge through open-domain retrieval systems. For\nexample, the fact \u201cJohn Nyskohus ... played for\nAdelaide City..\u201d is retrieved in this instance. Then,\nthe rationales are edited by providing the retrieved\nfacts in the prompts as memory refreshments. Thus,\nthe edited rationales could be updated corresponding to the retrieved facts (Fig. 1). Given the edited\nrationales, the new prediction is generated, which\nconsiders more factually aligned reasoning traces.\nTo our knowledge, our work is the first to postedit CoT-style reasoning chains to enhance predic-\ntion performance. We perform experiments on two\nopen-domain Question Answering (QA) tasks that\nrequire reasoning: Adversarial HotpotQA (Yang\net al., 2018) and 2WikiMultihop (Ho et al., 2020).\nWe also test its performance on the Fact Verification\ntask using Fever (Thorne et al., 2018). We find that\nthe model is able to benefit from more factual reasoning chains, thus generating more accurate predictions. For example, for open-domain QA, our\nmodel demonstrates 3.8x accuracy improvement\ncompared to similar retrieval-augmented models on\nAdvHotpot. On 2WikiMultihop, Verify-and-Edit\nreaches 33.6% accuracy with open-domain search,\nwhile CoT Self-Consistency stands at 27.7%.\n2\nRelated Work\nChain-of-Thought or CoT (Wei et al., 2022) is a\nprompting method for improving the reasoning\nabilities of LLMs, which enables LLMs to decompose complex problems into multiple intermediate\nsteps. CoT provides interpretability and has been\nproven to be more capable of solving complex problems than standard prompting methods.\nHowever, hallucination is a long-standing problem in NLP, especially for LLMs, which has drawn\nsignificant attention from the research communities.\nThe decoding process of LLMs is auto-regressive,\nwhich unavoidably makes it output nonfactual content without controlled generation (Ye and Durrett,\n2022; Wiegreffe et al., 2022). As such, the lack\nof supporting facts during the generation process\nof CoT could largely undermine the validity of the\nfinal answer (Golovneva et al., 2022). Ye and Durrett (2022) demonstrate that the accuracy of the\nfinal answers largely correlates with the factuality\nand consistency of the reasoning explanations. The\ncommonly proposed methods to improve the factuality of CoT reasoning process can be grouped\ninto two categories: prompt engineering and result\ncalibration.\nPrompt engineering methods are usually applied\nto guide LLMs to generate better intermediate reasoning explanations.\nReAct (Yao et al., 2022),\nwhich is the most comparable to our work, synergizes reasoning and acting in LLMs, where reasoning steps help the model induce and update\nactions, while action steps allow the model to consult additional information from Wikipedia for a\nfactuality check. Compared to ReAct, we generate\nmore natural and conversational CoTs for better\ninterpretability and easier learning. As such, our\n5824\n\fframework requires a much shorter prompt to learn.\nPress et al. (2022) propose self-ask by instructing\nthe LLM to explicitly ask itself (and then answer)\nfollow-up questions before answering the initial\nquestion. One natural way of solving a complex\nproblem is to decompose the problem into subproblems and solve them sequentially. Zhou et al.\n(2022) adopt the idea and propose least-to-most\nprompting. However, both self-ask and least-tomost prompting still rely on repetitively retrieving\ninternal knowledge learned by the LLM instead\nof connecting to external knowledge. Thus, their\nability to improve factuality is limited.\nResult calibration functions on the output of the\nLLMs. Ye and Durrett (2022) train a calibrator\nto calibrate the weights of the final answers based\non the factuality and consistency of the generated\nexplanations, which efficiently improves the results. The decoding method in CoT is naive greedy,\nwhich simply outputs the next token with the highest probability. Wang et al. (2022) propose a selfconsistency decoding method, which samples a\ndiverse set of reasoning paths and then selects the\nmost consistent answer by marginalizing out the\nsampled reasoning paths. Selection-Inference (SI)\n(Creswell et al., 2022) framework is another stateof-the-art method that exploits LLMs as general\nprocessing modules. Out of all the methods, it\nis also the first to systematically improve the factual correctness of CoTs in order to predict more\naccurately. It alternates between selection and inference to generate a series of interpretable, causal\nreasoning steps leading to the final answer, which\nis proven to be efficient. However, it is not designed for open-domain or commonsense question\nanswering.\nMoreover, another comparable line of work\nhas been exploring retrieval-augmented language\nmodel pretraining (REALM) (Guu et al., 2020),\nwhich first retrieves documents from an external\nknowledge source and then utilizes retrieved documents to process question-answering tasks. Lazaridou et al. (2022) propose to include Google search\nresults of the question in the prompt to improve the\nfactuality of the generated answer. However, such\nmethods may fail in complex questions as it does\nnot utilize the reasoning capability of LLMs. Thus,\nwe consider retrieval-augmented reasoning paths\nas a natural way to increase factual alignment.\n3\nVerify-and-Edit Framework\nOur goal is to make LLMs generate more factual\nreasoning chains with CoT prompting assisted with\nexternal knowledge, thereby also improving prediction accuracy of the final answer. We hypothesize\nthat this can enhance LLMs\u2019 capability to solve\ncomplex knowledge-intensive tasks that require\nmultiple reasoning steps to arrive at an answer.\nGenerally, we hope to follow the human reasoning process: when a person answers a question, if\nhe/she is unsure, he/she would search for a supporting fact and consider it before giving the final\nanswer. Thus, we could separate the Verify-andEdit (VE) framework into 3 different stages: finding uncertain predictions, editing their rationales\nby searching for supporting facts, and using the\nedited rationales to generate final answers (Fig. 1).\nIn designing the stages, we hope to maximally preserve the LLMs\u2019 biggest advantage: their opengeneration and reasoning ability. And we aim to\ndesign tasks and setups as natural and conversational as possible, thus making it easy to understand for humans and LLMs which are trained with\nnatural texts.\n3.1\nDeciding when to edit\nHow can we identify when a model is unsure of\nits prediction? The self-consistency method (Wang\net al., 2022) provides a solution. In sampling diverse reasoning paths and answers, self-consistency\nis found to be highly correlated with accuracy, suggesting that it could provide an uncertainty estimate\nand confer abilities for the model to \u201cknow when\nit doesn\u2019t know\". Thus, we begin the VE framework by using the consistency method to sample n\ndiverse reasoning paths for a prediction task. The\nhighly consistent predictions are left as-is. When\nconsistency is lower than \u2308n/2\u2309, i.e. the majority\ncannot agree on the same answer, we label it as\n\u201cuncertain\".\n3.2\nHow to edit a specific rationale\nThe rationale, i.e. the thought process (CoT), could\nbe viewed in two parts: facts and reasoning which\ncombines facts to derive a new claim. Thus, we\nconsider improving the CoT from both aspects.\n\u2022 Facts\nTo make the thought process more factually correct, we search for supporting facts in external knowledge sources (e.g. Wikipedia, Google).\nFirst, to mimic a human\u2019s query when searching\nfor validating facts, a natural question is gener-\n5825\n\fAlgorithm 1 Verify-and-Edit\nRequire: The original question q; An n-shot CoT prompt pcot\nRequire: An LLM f(\u00b7); LM number of completions n; LM decoding temperature \u03c4\nRequire: An external knowledge retrieval model g(\u00b7)\nRequire: n-shot prompts for verifying question generation (pvq) and answer generation (pva)\nR, A \u2190 f(pcot, q, n, \u03c4)\n\u25b7 Generate a set of reasonings (R) and answers (A).\ns\u2217\nsc \u2190 max P(a|pcot, q), a \u2208 A\n\u25b7 The highest self-consistency score among all answers.\nr\u2217, a\u2217 \u2190 arg max P(a|pcot, q), a \u2208 A\n\u25b7 Reasoning and answer with highest self-consistency.\nif s\u2217\nsc < \u2308 n\n2 \u2309 then\n\u25b7 Edit reasoning with a less-than-majority-agree consistency.\nfor oi \u2208 r\u2217 do\n\u25b7 Edit each sentence in the reasoning.\nu \u2190 f(pvq, q, oi)\n\u25b7 Generate verifying question.\nv \u2190 g(u)\n\u25b7 Retrieve external knowledge.\nw \u2190 f(pva, u, v)\n\u25b7 Generate verifying answer.\noi \u2190 w\n\u25b7 Edit original reasoning sentence with verifying answer.\nend for\na\u2217 \u2190 f(pcot, q, r\u2217)\n\u25b7 Generate final answer with edited reasoning.\nreturn a\u2217\nelse if s\u2217\nsc \u2265 \u2308n\n2 \u2309 then\n\u25b7 Answer with high consistency is left as-is.\nreturn a\u2217\nend if\nated to verify the rationale. For this, we use the\nin-context learning capability of the same LLM.\nThe original question and the rationale are both\nprovided in the prompt for verifying question generation to ensure that it asks for the most relevant\ninformation required to answer the original question, instead of other entities in the rationale. For\nexample, if the rationale (wrong) is \u201cthe US president born on 4 August 1961 is John Kennedy.\u201d\nand the original question is \"who is the spouse of\nthe US president born on 4 August 1961\u201d, we expect the generated verifying question to be: \u201cWho\nis the US president born on 4 August 1961?\u201d instead of \u201cWhen is John Kennedy\u2019s birthday?\u201d By\ngenerating a relevant question instead of directly\nquerying with the generated rationale, we eliminate\npotential noise brought by incorrect fact generation.\nIn the example above, if one retrieves using the\nwrong claim \u201cthe US president born on 4 August\n1961 is John Kennedy\u201d, the incorrect entity \u201cJohn\nKennedy\u201d may obfusticate the search process.\nIn this paper, we use relevant contexts retrieved from 3 systems: (i) DrQA (Chen et al.,\n2017), an open-domain question-answering system; (ii) Wikipedia search of relevant pages; and\n(iii) Google search, which demonstrates possibilities of combining LLMs and search engines.\nAs the retrieved contexts from a retrieval system\ncould be longer than desired, we use a pre-trained\nLM to rank and select the top-k sentences most\nsimilar to the verifying question query.\n\u2022 Reasoning\nWhile methods such as SelectionInference (Creswell et al., 2022) directly use retrieved facts as rationales, they are usually too verbose, longer than desired, or contain irrelevant details. Ye and Durrett (2022) have made similar\nobservations: directly using supporting sentences\nis usually too verbose and not sufficient.\nTo obtain more relevant and logical rationales,\nwe again utilize a natural and generative approach,\nas reasoning abilities are believed to be already\nbuilt into LLMs (Wei et al., 2022). In particular, by\nfeeding in prompts in the format of \u201cquestion, rationale, answer\u201d, the LLM learns to reason for a few\nsteps before answer generation. Upon investigating\nthe original rationales, we observe that, even when\nthey contain incorrect facts, the logical reasoning\ncomponent seems to be generally intact. Thus, we\nuse the verifying questions (as logic) and retrieved\nfacts (as information) to generate informed answers.\nThe informed answers are then composed into a\nnew rationale, providing potentially a more factual\nCoT.\n3.3\nAnswering again\nFinally, with the post-edited CoT, new answers are\ngenerated by prompting the LLM. A pseudocode\nof the overall procedure is given in Alg. 1, and illustrated with an example in Fig. 1 . We can see\n5826\n\fthat, by allowing the LLM to incorporate external knowledge, our method could result in more\nfactually-grounded rationales. When prompted into\nthe LLM as a CoT, it could bring in the information necessary to make a new prediction, which was\noriginally not remembered correctly by the model.\nCompared to specifically designed prompts such\nas ReAct (Yao et al., 2022), the Verify-and-Edit\nframework is simple and arguably more natural. Its\nconversational nature could allow humans to better\nunderstand the model\u2019s thought processes and have\nthe potential for users to naturally interfere and\nrevise at any stage of inference. In the experiments\npresented next, we also observe that such a setup\nis effective in mitigating factuality concerns and\nboosting end-task performances.\n4\nExperiment Setup\n4.1\nReasoning tasks\nAs the Verify-and-Edit framework offers more\nknowledge-grounded reasoning steps, it should\nbenefit tasks that fulfill the following two properties: (i) reliant on multi-hop reasoning to arrive\nat a later prediction, thus depending on rationale\ngeneration, and (ii) open-domain, thus needing to\ninteract with an external knowledge source.\nTherefore, we validate the approach on three\ndatasets: (i) Adversarial HotpotQA (Yang et al.,\n2018), a multi-hop question answering dataset. We\nuse the challenging subset proposed by Ye and\nDurrett (2022), where the correct and incorrect predictions are balanced using their model. (ii) 2WikiMultihop (Ho et al., 2020) a multi-hop questionanswering dataset exploiting the structured format\nin Wikidata and use logical rules.1\n(iii) Fever\n(Thorne et al., 2018), a fact verification dataset\nthat labels claims as \u201cSUPPORTS\u201d, \u201cREFUTES\u201d,\nor \u201cNOT ENOUGH INFO\u201d based on evidence paragraphs from Wikipedia. Similar to the HotpotQA\nsetup, we sample a challenging set by balancing\nthe samples where GPT3 CoT makes correct and\nincorrect predictions. Details on the processing and\nuse of the datasets can be found in Appendix A.\n4.2\nCompared methods\nTo provide the most state-of-art performance estimates, we utilize the GPT-3 instruct series API\ntext-davinci-003 (Ouyang et al., 2022), the\nstrongest and most up-to-date model at the time\n1We randomly sample 1,000 samples out of 12,576 dev\nsamples for cost considerations.\nof experiments, as a backbone. The cost of experiments is stated in Appendix B.\nAdversarial HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihop experiments used 6-shot and Fever used 3-shot incontext learning, as Fever questions are shorter\nand easier to learn. We use the manual annotations provided for HotpotQA by Ye and Durrett\n(2022) and manually annotate few-shot examples\nfor 2WikiMultihop and Fever in a similar format.\nFull prompts for baseline and our methods are provided in Appendix C.\nBaselines\nTo provide a more comprehensive\noverview of where our framework stands, we use\nthe following baselines:\n1. Standard Prediction (Standard): Directly predicting the label based on input, given the same\nnumber of in-context learning examples.\n2. Original CoT (Wei et al., 2022): Predicting the\nlabel after generating the explanation.\n3. CoT with Self-Consistency (CoT-SC) (Wang\net al., 2022): Sampling 5 CoT trajectories with\na decoding temperature of 0.7, which is recommended by the paper.\n4. Calibrator (Calib.) (Ye and Durrett, 2022): A\ncalibrator that tunes the probabilities of a prediction based on the score of its prediction.\n5. ReAct (Yao et al., 2022): A reason-and-act\nframework that utilizes an external Wikipedia\nAPI. For this baseline, we use the reported results in the original paper, which uses the PaLM\nmodel (Chowdhery et al., 2022), whose performance is similar to GPT-3.2 To add a more\njustified perspective, we report its performance\nimprovement gained on top of the CoT-SC baseline. 3\nVerify-and-Edit (VE)\nIn implementing the VE\nframework, the same consistency baseline is employed to estimate when the model is uncertain.\nAs stated in \u00a73.1, we edit all instances with a\nself-consistency score below \u2308n/2\u2309, where n is\nthe number of sampled paths. Then, the verifying questions are produced using a 2-shot4 setup\nwith in-context learning. The verifying answers are\n2We could not use PaLM as it is not open-sourced.\n3it is worth noting that ReAct conducted experiments on\nthe entire dataset, where we used a sampled version (see \u00a74.1).\n4As we observe that question generation quality does not\nvary too much as in-context examples increase, we select the\nshortest prompt that is able to generate reasonable questions\nto reduce cost.\n5827\n\fproduced using the same number of examples in\noriginal answer generation and greedy decoding.\nTo study the effect of knowledge retrieval systems on the results, we use four systems:\n1. Wikipedia-API (wiki): Searching for the query\nentities and selecting top sentences from their\nWikipedia pages.\n2. DrQA (Chen et al., 2017): A pre-trained opendomain QA model that combines bigram hashing, TF-IDF matching, and a multi-layer recurrent neural network model. We only utilize the\ncontexts retrieved from it.5\n3. Google: Using top-k search results produced by\nGoogle as assistive contexts. This result is interesting in providing possibilities in combining\nsearch engines and LLMs.\n4. Dataset: Selecting from the set of paragraphs\nprovided in Adversarial HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA, which includes ground-truth supporting contexts and distractor paragraphs. This\nis similar to an oracle setup, which provides an\nupper bound of the performance boost, assuming we have a good retrieval system.\nFor 1, 2, and 4, after retrieving, we select the top\n3 sentences most similar to the query ranked by the\npre-trained Sentence BERT model (Reimers and\nGurevych, 2019) as context.\n5\nResults and Analysis\n5.1\nUsing Self-Consistency: know when it\ndoesn\u2019t know\nFor the first step in the Verify-and-Edit framework,\nconsistency is used to measure the model\u2019s confidence in a prediction. Aligned with the findings\nfrom Wang et al. (2022), we hypothesize that when\nthe consistency is low, the model is more uncertain\nand thus more likely to generate inaccurate predictions. To test whether this hypothesis holds, we plot\nthe kernal density estimation plots for consistency\ndistribution on the Adversarial HotpotQA dataset.\nAs shown in Fig. 2, the incorrect samples show a\nleft-skewed consistency distribution, where most\nincorrect predictions have low consistencies. On\nthe other hand, the distribution of correct predictions shows a right-skewed tendency, where there\nare very few incorrect samples with higher consistencies. This effectively validates our hypothesis.\n5We selected DrQA by first conducting small-scale experiments with different open-domain QA models, including\nDPR (Karpukhin et al., 2020). DrQA is found to yield better\nperformance. Thus, we consistently use it.\nFigure 2: Kernal density estimation plots for consistency\non the Adversarial HotpotQA dataset. With kernal estimation, the curve extends its true distribution\u2019s range,\nwhich is from 0 to 5 (as we sampled 5 paths).\nMethod\nknowledge\nEM\n\u2206EM\nAUC\nCoT-SC \u2192 ReAct\nWiki.\n34.2%\n+0.8%\n-ReAct \u2192 CoT-SC\nWiki.\n35.1%\n+1.7%\n-\nStandard\n-23.1%\n-43.24\nCoT\n-31.8%\n-38.30\nCoT-SC\n-31.2%\n-34.97\nCoT-SC + Calib.\nDataset\n-49.00\nCoT-SC + VE\nWiki.\n35.7%\n+4.5%\n45.62\nCoT-SC + VE\nDRQA\n36.0%\n+4.8%\n46.06\nCoT-SC + VE\nGoogle\n37.7%\n+6.5%\n47.98\nCoT-SC + VE\nDataset\n56.8%\n+25.6%\n60.94\nTable 1: Results on the Adversarial HotpotQA dataset.\nThe best result for each model is underlined and the best\nresult overall is bolded. \u2206EM represents the improvement on Exact Match from the CoT-SC baseline.

To show the effects of different thresholds\non the framework\u2019s performance, we also provide\nan ablation study later.\n5.2\nResults on HotpotQA\nReported in Table 1, we observe that CoT improves\non top of the Standard few-shot setting. CoT-SC,\non the other hand, does not demonstrate a good\nimprovement on the baseline. Using the calibrator from Ye and Durrett (2022), AUC is improved\nas it learns to calibrate the answer weights based\non ground-truth contexts provided in the dataset.\nThus, it should be compared with the last setup\nof VE, where we use dataset knowledge.

When we combine the search engine results from Google into the\nframework, the EM is increased by 6.5%, which\nis 3.8x the ReAct result. This shows a promising\nmethod for combining search engines and LLMs,\nwhich is a popular direction now. Search engines return factual results, but are less powerful in queries\nthat require reasoning. On the other hand, LLMs\nare powerful in reasoning and abstraction but tend\nto generate plausible-sounding but incorrect statements (OpenAI-Blog, 2022; Zhao et al., 2023). To\ncombine the best of both worlds, we could utilize\nthe long memory of LLMs, as many users have\nreported that GPT is able to remember inputs mentioned earlier in the dialogue. By providing factual\nresults from the search engines as a memory refreshment, GPT is able to generate better and more\nfactual predictions.\nThen, when we use the adversarially augmented\nparagraphs provided in the dataset, the model is\nable to demonstrate very high EM (56.8%) and\nAUC (60.94) at the same time. This setup shows\nthat, if we have a highly compressed set of contexts and a nearly-ideal retrieval system, the Verifyand-Edit framework could potentially result in very\nstrong performances.\n5.3\nResults on 2WikiMultiHop\nAs shown in Table 2, our method demonstrates even\nstronger performances on 2WikiMultiHop compared to HotpotQA.

Selecting from paragraphs provided in\nthe dataset, which includes supporting evidences\nand irrelevant paragraphs, the accuracy improvement is further increased to 9.5%. The calibrator,\non the other hand, uses the dataset provided paragraphs but still lags behind all variations of our\nVerify-and-Edit framework.\n5.4\nResults on fact verification\nResults on the Fever dataset are shown in Table 3.\nAs the reasoning required by the Fever dataset is\nless multi-hop compared to HotpotQA and 2WikiMultiHop, we anticipate that it should demonstrate\nlower improvements compared to the other two.\nIn the Fever dataset, the calibrator method completely fails, decreasing to 33.7%: it calibrates\nthe prediction scores based on factuality estimates,\nwhich is produced by examining the overlap between the reasoning path and the provided context.\nHowever, in such Fact Verification datasets, there is\nno provided contexts. Thus, we calibrate using the\noriginal claim, which results in bad performances.\nIt shows here that one limitation of the calibrator\nmethod is that it only applies to cases with provided\nrelevant contexts.\nEven though this task does not require much\nreasoning, employing the Verify-and-Edit framework, we are able to observe consistent improvements over the baseline method. Similar to before,\nthe Wikipedia retrieval is able to result in a larger\nimprovement over DrQA, and Google search improves further at 1.9%.\nCompared to our method, ReAct is able to\ndemonstrate a larger improvement on Fever. First\nof all, it has been mentioned before that Fever is\nless suited for the Verify-and-Edit framework as it\n5829\n\f# Examples\nCohen \u03ba\nCoT-SC\nOurs\nTie\n50\n0.25\n17%\n53%\n30%\nTable 4: Human study for factuality of CoTs on the\nHotpotQA dataset. \u201cOurs\u201d refers to the Verify-and-Edit\nmodel with Google retrieval.\nrequires less reasoning to solve the task. Secondly,\nReAct prompts are much longer than our prompts,\nrequiring more computational costs.\n5.5\nCost considerations\nAs cost reduction is a main concern when interacting with LLMs, our method takes it into consideration and attempts to reduce computational\ncosts from two aspects: Firstly, Verify-and-Edit\nonly makes edits for selected instances, whereas\nothers edit every time. Specifically, we only revise\nwhen the model is uncertain (judged by consistency), which occurs 40% of the time. As a comparison, other methods, such as ReAct, retrieve\nrelevant information and edit for every single instance, resulting in higher costs. Secondly, Verifyand-Edit designs tasks that are natural and conversational, requiring only a few demonstrations and\nshort prompts to learn. For example, other methods\nusually learn non-natural calls, such as [thought]\nand [action] tags in ReAct and API calls in Toolformer (Schick et al., 2023). Therefore, the LLM\nrequires longer prompts, more demonstrations, or\neven fine-tuning to learn the format. On the other\nhand, we design Verify-and-Edit tasks to be as natural as possible, requiring minimal effort to learn.\nOur tasks only consist of asking and answering\nquestions, with no synthetic tags or tasks to be\nlearned. As a comparison, with the GPT-3 API, for\nediting one Fever instance, Verify-and-Edit costs\n$0.014, whereas ReAct costs $0.017.\n5.6\nEvaluating the reasoning chains with\nhuman study\nTo closely examine the faithfulness of the generated reasoning chains, we also conduct a smallscale human study experiment. During the experiment, two human volunteers are shown 50 randomly selected questions with generated reasoning\nchains from CoT-SC and Verify-and-Edit on the\nHotpotQA dataset. They are then asked to select\nthe more factually consistent one. Volunteers are\nencouraged to use search engines as assistance. A\ndetailed description on the setup is described in\nAppendix D.\nFigure 3: Ablation study on the effect of various consistency thresholds on task performances on Adversarial\nHotpotQA\nShown in Table 4, humans select the reasoning\nchains produced by Verify-and-Edit as more factually consistent 53% of the time, compared to 17%\nfor the CoT-SC baseline. The Cohen \u03ba is at 0.25,\nshowing fair agreement between the two annotators (McHugh, 2012). The annotators used Google\nsearch as an assistive tool 100% of the time, which\nshows the necessity of introducing external knowledge.\nMoreover, human annotations in this case require a lot of efforts. Annotators report 1.5 minutes\non average to validate one data point. Thus, automating the Verify-and-Edit process is of benefits\nas an assistive tool to reduce human labor.\nTo observe the qualitative effects of the Verifyand-Edit framework in detail, we also include several interesting examples in Appendix E, which\nshow the effectiveness of our framework in correcting the original claims.\n5.7\nAblation study: editing at different\nconsistency thresholds\nIn the Verify-and-Edit framework, the only hyperparameter to select is the consistency threshold.\nSimilar thresholds also exists in ReAct (Yao et al.,\n2022), where the CoT \u2192 ReAct method is to employ ReAct-style prompting when \u201cthe majority\nanswer among n CoT-SC samples occurs less than\nn/2 times\". Using majority counts, however, is less\nfine-grained compared to using the original consistency formulated with log probablities. Thus,\nwe employ the original score proposed by Wang\net al. (2022), which is the unnormalized answer\nprobabilities marginalized over the rationales\u2019 log\nprobabilities. To mimic a majority-vote threshold,\nwe select \u2308n/2\u2309, where n is the number of sampled\npaths.\nTo study the effect of adjusting the consistency\n5830\n\fthreshold on our framework, we show the ablation\nresults of Adversarial HotpotQA in Fig. 3. As\nthe threshold increases, accuracy first increases,\nreaching a peak close to \u2308n/2\u2309, which is 3, before\ndecreasing. The AUC scores demonstrate a similar\ntrend.\nAs shown in Fig. 2, when consistency is larger\nthan majority (\u2308n/2\u2309), there are usually more correct predictions rather than incorrect predictions,\nand vice versa. Thus, as we increase the consistency threshold from 0 to \u2308n/2\u2309, more uncertain\nand possibly incorrect samples are getting edited by\nintroducing external knowledge. As we go beyond\nthe ideal threshold \u2308n/2\u2309, we are mostly re-editing\ncorrect samples, and the introduced noise may disrupt the original reasoning chains.\nThus, we recommend a consistency threshold at\n\u2308n/2\u2309 as an ideal level.\n6\nConclusions\nIn this paper, we introduce a Verify-and-Edit framework for open-domain question-answering. It is\na first attempt to post-edit CoT-style reasoning\nchains for better end-task performance. By combining knowledge retrieval with reasoning, the framework edits CoTs in a natural and conversational\nway, which enhances prediction factuality. Combined with Google search, the framework also\nshows a promising direction that combines the\nopen-generation ability of state-of-art LLMs with\nthe updated facts provided by search engines.\nLimitations\nThere are a few limitations to the current framework. Firstly, Verify-and-Edit works the best for\nopen-domain question-answering tasks that require\ncomplex reasoning. Less complex datasets or commonsense datasets that do not require knowledge\nretrieval may not result in high improvements. Secondly, it is most ideal to edit a group of mostly\nincorrect samples, which we try to select by using\nconsistency. Thus, our method is reliant on the consistency method\u2019s performance and its abilities to\nseparate correct and incorrect predictions. Most often, it can demonstrate a larger improvement with\na more challenging set of examples.\nTo address these limitations, we plan to work on\nreducing the noise brought in the rationale-editing\nstage and utilize more knowledge resources, such\nas knowledge bases, as a follow-up.\nEthics Statement\nThe Verify-and-Edit framework can mitigate potential ethical concerns of LLM generation surrounding hallucinations and unfactual details. Some persisting concerns include: (1) As the framework uses\ngoogle as one of the retrieval methods, it could retrieve potentially toxic information that exists in\ngoogle search results. (2) As the framework uses\nGPT3 as a backbone, it could suffer from existing\nethical concerns of GPT3, such as responding to\ntoxic queries or exhibiting biased behavior.\nFor knowledge retrieval, we used Wikipedia\ncorpus and google search results.\nPermission\nis granted to copy, distribute and/or modify\nWikipedia\u2019s text under the terms of the Creative\nCommons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

(2) Set of adversarial contexts is reduced\nto two ground truth supporting paragraphs and two\nadversarial paragraphs, instead of using all eight\ndistractors. Each paragraph is further simplified by\nonly keeping relevant sentences needed for answering the question (or distracting the prediction) (3)\nA challenging test set of 250 examples is formed by\nbalancing the mix of examples on which prompted\ntext-davinci-001 (which is used at their time\nof experiments) to make correct and incorrect predictions. This is done by first running few-shot\ninference over 1000 examples, and then randomly\nsampling 125 examples with correct and incorrect\npredictions, respectively.

The volunteers are NLP Ph.D. students who are proficient in\nEnglish. The volunteers understand the use for the\ndata collection and are in consensus. The reasoning\nchain 1 and 2 are CoTs generated by the CoT-SC\nbaseline and the Verify-and-Edit shown in random\norder. On average, each volunteer took 1.25 hours\nto finish 50 samples.\nE\nQualitative Examples\nIn Table 5, 3 examples from the Adversarial HotpotQA datasets are shown in detail.\nFrom the first sample, the LLM incorrectly states\nthat the song is \u201cbased on .. Spider-Man.\u201d However, in the Google retrieved facts, it clearly states\nthat it is based on \u201cGhost Rider\u201d. Therefore, the\nretrieved fact is able to help correct the detail in the\nrationale. Moreover, although the original rationale\nalso covered the brand name \u201cMarvel Comics\u201d, the\ngeneration goes on with the hero name as an answer, instead of the \u201cbrand\u201d being asked. Feeding\nin again also corrects that logical mistake.\nIn the second example, the LLM makes up a\nplausible-sounding fact that \u201cTony Robinson has\nwritten seven children\u2019s books\u201d. There is also no indicator on the LLM\u2019s confidence level of this claim.\nThus, if a user is unfamiliar with this knowledge,\nit could easily be mistaken as a true fact, which is\nhighly risky. By introducing Google as an assistive\ntool, we retrieve the sentence \u201che has published 16\nchildren\u2019s books.\u201d With this newly retrieved fact\nin mind, the LLM goes on generating the correct\nanswer.\nThe third example is an interesting one. The\noriginal CoT already makes mistakes in the first\nsentence and goes on making continued mistakes\nin the second sentence as well. This is a type of\ncommon mistake in the dataset as well. On correcting them, the Verify-and-Edit framework is able\nto correct the first claim with the show \u201cChelsea\nDoes\u201d. The second claim, however, is verified but\nirrelevant to the original question anymore. In this\ncase, by feeding in both rationale sentences, the\nLLM is able to select the relevant fact as an answer, while disregarding the rest. This example\nshows that the CoT setup used by Verify-and-Edit\nis important as it allows for models to reason and\nabstract for a second time, instead of plainly replacing and correcting.\n5837\n\fOriginal Question\nSuicide\u2019s 1977 released album features a song based on what brand\u2019s comic character?\nTrue Answer\nMarvel Comics\nCoT-SC\nFirst, Suicide released their 1977 album titled Suicide: Alan Vega & Martin Rev.\nSecond, the album features a song based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man.\nThe answer is Spider-Man.\nVerifying Questions\nWhat album was released by Suicide in 1977?\nWhat comic character is the song on Suicide\u2019s 1977 album based on?\nRetrieved Facts\nSuicide is the debut studio album from the American rock band Suicide.

Generating unfactual texts not only leads to lower performances but also degrades the trust and validity of their applications. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves trust and model performance on complex reasoning tasks by generating interpretable reasoning chains, but still suffers from factuality concerns in knowledge-intensive tasks. In this paper, we propose the Verify-and-Edit framework for CoT prompting, which seeks to increase prediction factuality by post-editing reasoning chains according to external knowledge. Building on top of GPT-3, our framework lead to accuracy improvements in multiple open-domain question-answering tasks. For reproducing our results and extending the framework further, we make our codebase available at [https://github.com/RuochenZhao/Verify-and-Edit](https://github.com/RuochenZhao/Verify-and-Edit)\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have become the new norm in many downstream NLP tasks. In utilizing these LLMs, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting Wei et al. (2022) is found to improve performances for tasks that require complex reasoning, such as math word problems, commonsense reasoning, and symbolic manipulation. At the same time, it is able to generate interpretable reasoning chains. Recent work further explored how to use these reasoning chains to select better predictions. However, the primary focus of these methods has been to improve end-task performance by utilizing generated CoTs as-is. For example, Ye and Durrett (2022) train a calibrator that tunes prediction probabilities based on rationale scores; Wang et al. (2022) sample multiple reasoning paths to find the most common (consistent) prediction. Only a few, such as Creswell et al. (2022) and Zhou et al. (2022), have explored ways to improve the quality of CoTs themselves.\n\nIn fact, improving the CoT quality could be beneficial in enhancing both interpretability and end-task performance. Ye and Durrett (2022) point out that explanations judged as good by humans often indicate more accurate predictions. Intuitively, a better set of CoT prompts could provide better grounding and logically consistent thought processes, thus leading to more accurate predictions.\n\nTo improve generation quality, one important aspect is _factual correctness_, which is currently\n\nFigure 1: The Verify-and-Edit framework consists of five steps: (1) pass predictions with lower-than-average consistency to the next stages while leaving highly consistent predictions as-is; (2) produce verifying questions; (3) retrieve external knowledge; (4) edit rationales with informed answers; and (5) produce new predictions.\n\none of the most fatal drawbacks of LLMs (OpenAI-Blog, 2022; Zhao et al., 2023). In answering user queries, LLMs such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) tend to make up facts and details, which is now flagged as a primary warning in their API usage. As a major use case of LLMs is the prospect of replacing traditional search engines and usage for more direct information access through question-answering, factuality concerns could largely undermine their validity and degrade users' level of trust (Marcus, 2022). Fixing this issue is challenging and the concerns still persist even after the models are instruction-tuned with human feedback (Ouyang et al., 2022). This is because the source of truth can be unavailable during the finetuning process (OpenAI-Blog, 2022).\n\nThus, it is of urgent concern to better control the generation and increase the factual correctness of predictions. As LLMs could fail to recall accurate details when functioning as a knowledge base (Ye and Durrett, 2022; Creswell et al., 2022), if possible, knowledge from external sources could be introduced as assistance. Assisted thought process is also common in human reasoning: when humans answer questions, they often search (or revisit) external knowledge sources for supporting facts in order to refresh their (internal) memory.\n\nInspired by this, in this work we propose a **Verify-and-Edit** (VE) framework to post-edit the reasoning chains for more factually aligned predictions. As shown in Fig. 1, we first select uncertain instances to edit, which have a less-than-majority-agree consistency. These instances, as implied by Wang et al. (2022), often consist of plausible-sounding statements, such as the sentence \"John Nyskohus played for the Norwegian football team Odd Greenland\" in Fig. 1. When editing, we first generate a question to verify this detail, such as \"What team did John Nyskohus play for?\" Then, to answer this query, we introduce external knowledge through open-domain retrieval systems. For example, the fact \"John Nyskohus... played for Adelaide City...\" is retrieved in this instance. Then, the rationales are edited by providing the retrieved facts in the prompts as memory refreshments. Thus, the edited rationales could be updated corresponding to the retrieved facts (Fig. 1). Given the edited rationales, the new prediction is generated, which considers more factually aligned reasoning traces.\n\nTo our knowledge, our work is the first to post-edit CoT-style reasoning chains to enhance prediction performance. We perform experiments on two open-domain Question Answering (QA) tasks that require reasoning: Adversarial HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018) and 2WikiMultihop (Ho et al., 2020). We also test its performance on the Fact Verification task using Fever (Thorne et al., 2018). We find that the model is able to benefit from more factual reasoning chains, thus generating more accurate predictions. For example, for open-domain QA, our model demonstrates 3.8x accuracy improvement compared to similar retrieval-augmented models on AdvHotpot. On 2WikiMultihop, Verify-and-Edit reaches 33.6% accuracy with open-domain search, while CoT Self-Consistency stands at 27.7%.\n\n## 2 Related Work\n\nChain-of-Thought or CoT (Wei et al., 2022) is a prompting method for improving the reasoning abilities of LLMs, which enables LLMs to decompose complex problems into multiple intermediate steps. CoT provides interpretability and has been proven to be more capable of solving complex problems than standard prompting methods.\n\nHowever, hallucination is a long-standing problem in NLP, especially for LLMs, which has drawn significant attention from the research communities. The decoding process of LLMs is auto-regressive, which unavoidably makes it output nonfactual content without controlled generation (Ye and Durrett, 2022; Wiegreffe et al., 2022). As such, the lack of supporting facts during the generation process of CoT could largely undermine the validity of the final answer (Golovneva et al., 2022). Ye and Durrett (2022) demonstrate that the accuracy of the final answers largely correlates with the factuality and consistency of the reasoning explanations. The commonly proposed methods to improve the factuality of CoT reasoning process can be grouped into two categories: prompt engineering and result calibration.\n\nPrompt engineering methods are usually applied to guide LLMs to generate better intermediate reasoning explanations. _ReAct_(Yao et al., 2022), which is the most comparable to our work, synergizes reasoning and acting in LLMs, where reasoning steps help the model induce and update actions, while action steps allow the model to consult additional information from Wikipedia for a factuality check. Compared to _ReAct_, we generate more natural and conversational CoTs for better interpretability and easier learning. As such, our framework requires a much shorter prompt to learn. Press et al. (2022) propose _self-ask_ by instructing the LLM to explicitly ask itself (and then answer) follow-up questions before answering the initial question. One natural way of solving a complex problem is to decompose the problem into subproblems and solve them sequentially. Zhou et al. (2022) adopt the idea and propose _least-to-most_ prompting. However, both _self-ask_ and _least-to-most_ prompting still rely on repetitively retrieving internal knowledge learned by the LLM instead of connecting to external knowledge. Thus, their ability to improve factuality is limited.\n\nResult calibration functions on the output of the LLMs. Ye and Durrett (2022) train a calibrator to calibrate the weights of the final answers based on the factuality and consistency of the generated explanations, which efficiently improves the results. The decoding method in CoT is naive greedy, which simply outputs the next token with the highest probability. Wang et al. (2022) propose a _self-consistency_ decoding method, which samples a diverse set of reasoning paths and then selects the most consistent answer by marginalizing out the sampled reasoning paths. _Selection-Inference (SI)_(Creswell et al., 2022) framework is another state-of-the-art method that exploits LLMs as general processing modules. Out of all the methods, it is also the first to systematically improve the factual correctness of CoTs in order to predict more accurately. It alternates between selection and inference to generate a series of interpretable, causal reasoning steps leading to the final answer, which is proven to be efficient. However, it is not designed for open-domain or commonsense question answering.\n\nMoreover, another comparable line of work has been exploring retrieval-augmented language model pretraining (REALM) (Guu et al., 2020), which first retrieves documents from an external knowledge source and then utilizes retrieved documents to process question-answering tasks. Lazaridou et al. (2022) propose to include Google search results of the question in the prompt to improve the factuality of the generated answer. However, such methods may fail in complex questions as it does not utilize the reasoning capability of LLMs. Thus, we consider retrieval-augmented reasoning paths as a natural way to increase factual alignment.\n\n## 3 Verify-and-Edit Framework\n\nOur goal is to make LLMs generate more factual reasoning chains with CoT prompting assisted with external knowledge, thereby also improving prediction accuracy of the final answer. We hypothesize that this can enhance LLMs' capability to solve complex knowledge-intensive tasks that require multiple reasoning steps to arrive at an answer.\n\nGenerally, we hope to follow the human reasoning process: when a person answers a question, if he/she is unsure, he/she would search for a supporting fact and consider it before giving the final answer. Thus, we could separate the Verify-and-Edit (VE) framework into 3 different stages: finding uncertain predictions, editing their rationales by searching for supporting facts, and using the edited rationales to generate final answers (Fig. 1). In designing the stages, we hope to maximally preserve the LLMs' biggest advantage: their open-generation and reasoning ability. And we aim to design tasks and setups as natural and conversational as possible, thus making it easy to understand for humans and LLMs which are trained with natural texts.\n\n### Deciding when to edit\n\nHow can we identify when a model is unsure of its prediction? The self-consistency method (Wang et al., 2022) provides a solution. In sampling diverse reasoning paths and answers, self-consistency is found to be highly correlated with accuracy, suggesting that it could provide an uncertainty estimate and confer abilities for the model to \"know when it doesn't know\". Thus, we begin the VE framework by using the consistency method to sample \\(n\\) diverse reasoning paths for a prediction task. The highly consistent predictions are left as-is. When consistency is lower than \\(\\lceil n/2\\rceil\\), _i.e._ the majority cannot agree on the same answer, we label it as \"uncertain\".\n\n### How to edit a specific rationale\n\nThe rationale, _i.e._ the thought process (CoT), could be viewed in two parts: facts and reasoning which combines facts to derive a new claim. Thus, we consider improving the CoT from both aspects.\n\n\\(\\bullet\\)**Facts** To make the thought process more factually correct, we search for supporting facts in external knowledge sources (_e.g._ Wikipedia, Google).\n\nFirst, to mimic a human's query when searching for validating facts, a natural question is generated to verify the rationale. For this, we use the in-context learning capability of the same LLM. The original question and the rationale are both provided in the prompt for verifying question generation to ensure that it asks for the most relevant information required to answer the original question, instead of other entities in the rationale. For example, if the rationale (wrong) is \"the US president born on 4 August 1961 is John Kennedy.\" and the original question is \"who is the spouse of the US president born on 4 August 1961\", we expect the generated verifying question to be: \"Who is the US president born on 4 August 1961?\" instead of \"When is John Kennedy's birthday?\" By generating a relevant question instead of directly querying with the generated rationale, we eliminate potential noise brought by incorrect fact generation. In the example above, if one retrieves using the wrong claim \"the US president born on 4 August 1961 is John Kennedy\", the incorrect entity \"John Kennedy\" may obfuscate the search process.\n\nIn this paper, we use relevant contexts retrieved from 3 systems: (_i_) DrQA (Chen et al., 2017), an open-domain question-answering system; (_ii_) Wikipedia search of relevant pages; and (_iii_) Google search, which demonstrates possibilities of combining LLMs and search engines.\n\nAs the retrieved contexts from a retrieval system could be longer than desired, we use a pre-trained LM to rank and select the top-\\(k\\) sentences most similar to the verifying question query.\n\n\\(\\bullet\\)ReasoningWhile methods such as Selection-Inference (Creswell et al., 2022) directly use retrieved facts as rationales, they are usually too verbose, longer than desired, or contain irrelevant details. Ye and Durrett (2022) have made similar observations: directly using supporting sentences is usually too verbose and not sufficient.\n\nTo obtain more relevant and logical rationales, we again utilize a natural and generative approach, as reasoning abilities are believed to be already built into LLMs (Wei et al., 2022). In particular, by feeding in prompts in the format of \"question, rationale, answer\", the LLM learns to reason for a few steps before answer generation. Upon investigating the original rationales, we observe that, even when they contain incorrect facts, the logical reasoning component seems to be generally intact. Thus, we use the verifying questions (as logic) and retrieved facts (as information) to generate informed answers. The informed answers are then composed into a new rationale, providing potentially a more factual CoT.\n\n### Answering again\n\nFinally, with the post-edited CoT, new answers are generated by prompting the LLM. A pseudocode of the overall procedure is given in Alg. 1, and illustrated with an example in Fig. 1. We can see that, by allowing the LLM to incorporate external knowledge, our method could result in more factually-grounded rationales. When prompted into the LLM as a CoT, it could bring in the information necessary to make a new prediction, which was originally not remembered correctly by the model.\n\nCompared to specifically designed prompts such as ReAct (Yao et al., 2022), the Verify-and-Edit framework is simple and arguably more natural. Its conversational nature could allow humans to better understand the model's thought processes and have the potential for users to naturally interfere and revise at any stage of inference. In the experiments presented next, we also observe that such a setup is effective in mitigating factuality concerns and boosting end-task performances.\n\n## 4 Experiment Setup\n\n### Reasoning tasks\n\nAs the Verify-and-Edit framework offers more knowledge-grounded reasoning steps, it should benefit tasks that fulfill the following two properties: (_i_) reliant on multi-hop reasoning to arrive at a later prediction, thus depending on rationale generation, and (_ii_) open-domain, thus needing to interact with an external knowledge source.\n\nTherefore, we validate the approach on three datasets: (_i_) **Adversarial HotpotQA**(Yang et al., 2018), a multi-hop question answering dataset. We use the challenging subset proposed by Ye and Durrett (2022), where the correct and incorrect predictions are balanced using their model. (_ii_) **2WikiMultihop**(Ho et al., 2020) a multi-hop question-answering dataset exploiting the structured format in Wikidata and use logical rules.1 (_iii_) **Fever**(Thorne et al., 2018), a fact verification dataset that labels claims as \"SUPPORTS\", \"REFUTES\", or \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\" based on evidence paragraphs from Wikipedia. Similar to the HotpotQA setup, we sample a challenging set by balancing the samples where GPT3 CoT makes correct and incorrect predictions. Details on the processing and use of the datasets can be found in Appendix A.\n\nFootnote 1: We randomly sample 1,000 samples out of 12,576 dev samples for cost considerations.\n\n### Compared methods\n\nTo provide the most state-of-art performance estimates, we utilize the GPT-3 instruct series API text-davinci-003(Ouyang et al., 2022), the strongest and most up-to-date model at the time of experiments, as a backbone. The cost of experiments is stated in Appendix B.\n\nAdversarial HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihop experiments used 6-shot and Fever used 3-shot in-context learning, as Fever questions are shorter and easier to learn. We use the manual annotations provided for HotpotQA by Ye and Durrett (2022) and manually annotate few-shot examples for 2WikiMultihop and Fever in a similar format. Full prompts for baseline and our methods are provided in Appendix C.\n\nBaselinesTo provide a more comprehensive overview of where our framework stands, we use the following baselines:\n\n1. **Standard Prediction** (Standard): Directly predicting the label based on input, given the same number of in-context learning examples.\n2. **Original CoT**(Wei et al., 2022): Predicting the label after generating the explanation.\n3. **CoT with Self-Consistency** (CoT-SC) (Wang et al., 2022): Sampling 5 CoT trajectories with a decoding temperature of 0.7, which is recommended by the paper.\n4. **Calibrator**(Calib.) (Ye and Durrett, 2022): A calibrator that tunes the probabilities of a prediction based on the score of its prediction.\n5. **ReAct**(Yao et al., 2022): A reason-and-act framework that utilizes an external Wikipedia API. For this baseline, we use the reported results in the original paper, which uses the PaLM model (Chowdhery et al., 2022), whose performance is similar to GPT-3.2 To add a more justified perspective, we report its performance improvement gained on top of the CoT-SC baseline. 3 Footnote 2: We could not use PaLM as it is not open-sourced.\n\nVerify-and-Edit (VE)In implementing the VE framework, the same consistency baseline is employed to estimate when the model is uncertain. As stated in SS3.1, we edit all instances with a self-consistency score below \\(\\lceil n/2\\rceil\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of sampled paths. Then, the verifying questions are produced using a 2-shot4 setup with in-context learning. The verifying answers are produced using the same number of examples in original answer generation and greedy decoding.\n\nTo study the effect of knowledge retrieval systems on the results, we use four systems:\n\n1. **Wikipedia-API** (wiki): Searching for the query entities and selecting top sentences from their Wikipedia pages.\n2. **DrQA**[4]: A pre-trained open-domain QA model that combines bigram hashing, TF-IDF matching, and a multi-layer recurrent neural network model. We only utilize the contexts retrieved from it.5 Footnote 5: We selected DrQA by first conducting small-scale experiments with different open-domain QA models, including DPR [10]. DrQA is found to yield better performance. Thus, we consistently use it.\n3. **Google**: Using top-\\(k\\) search results produced by Google as assistive contexts. This result is interesting in providing possibilities in combining search engines and LLMs.\n4. **Dataset**: Selecting from the set of paragraphs provided in Adversarial HotpotQA and 2Wiki-MultihopQA, which includes ground-truth supporting contexts and distractor paragraphs. This is similar to an oracle setup, which provides an upper bound of the performance boost, assuming we have a good retrieval system.\n\nFor 1, 2, and 4, after retrieving, we select the top 3 sentences most similar to the query ranked by the pre-trained Sentence BERT model [11] as context.\n\n## 5 Results and Analysis\n\n### Using Self-Consistency: know when it doesn't know\n\nFor the first step in the Verify-and-Edit framework, consistency is used to measure the model's confidence in a prediction. Aligned with the findings from Wang et al. (2022), we hypothesize that when the consistency is low, the model is more uncertain and thus more likely to generate inaccurate predictions. To test whether this hypothesis holds, we plot the kernal density estimation plots for consistency distribution on the Adversarial HotpotQA dataset. As shown in Fig. 2, the incorrect samples show a left-skewed consistency distribution, where most incorrect predictions have low consistencies. On the other hand, the distribution of correct predictions shows a right-skewed tendency, where there are very few incorrect samples with higher consistencies. This effectively validates our hypothesis.\n\nIn the main experiments, we use \\(\\lceil n/2\\rceil\\) as a majority threshold and edit all samples below it, which is at \\(3\\). To show the effects of different thresholds on the framework's performance, we also provide an ablation study later.\n\n### Results on HotpotQA\n\nReported in Table 1, we observe that CoT improves on top of the Standard few-shot setting. CoT-SC, on the other hand, does not demonstrate a good improvement on the baseline. Using the calibrator from Ye and Durrett (2022), AUC is improved as it learns to calibrate the answer weights based on ground-truth contexts provided in the dataset. Thus, it should be compared with the last setup of VE, where we use dataset knowledge.

When we combine the search engine results from Google into the framework, the EM is increased by 6.5%, which is 3.8x the ReAct result. This shows a promising method for combining search engines and LLMs, which is a popular direction now. Search engines return factual results, but are less powerful in queries that require reasoning. On the other hand, LLMs are powerful in reasoning and abstraction but tend to generate plausible-sounding but incorrect statements (OpenAI-Blog, 2022; Zhao et al., 2023). To combine the best of both worlds, we could utilize the long memory of LLMs, as many users have reported that GPT is able to remember inputs mentioned earlier in the dialogue. By providing factual results from the search engines as a memory refreshment, GPT is able to generate better and more factual predictions.\n\nThen, when we use the adversarially augmented paragraphs provided in the dataset, the model is able to demonstrate very high EM (56.8%) and AUC (60.94) at the same time. This setup shows that, if we have a highly compressed set of contexts and a nearly-ideal retrieval system, the Verify-and-Edit framework could potentially result in very strong performances.\n\n### Results on 2WikiMultiHop\n\nAs shown in Table 2, our method demonstrates even stronger performances on 2WikiMultiHop compared to HotpotQA. The Verify-and-Edit framework with open-domain retrieval is able to generate a high accuracy improvement, ranging from 3.4% to 5.9%. Selecting from paragraphs provided in the dataset, which includes supporting evidences and irrelevant paragraphs, the accuracy improvement is further increased to 9.5%. The calibrator, on the other hand, uses the dataset provided paragraphs but still lags behind all variations of our Verify-and-Edit framework.\n\n### Results on fact verification\n\nResults on the Fever dataset are shown in Table 3. As the reasoning required by the Fever dataset is less multi-hop compared to HotpotQA and 2WikiMultiHop, we anticipate that it should demonstrate lower improvements compared to the other two.\n\nIn the Fever dataset, the calibrator method completely fails, decreasing to 33.7%: it calibrates the prediction scores based on factuality estimates, which is produced by examining the overlap between the reasoning path and the provided context. However, in such Fact Verification datasets, there is no provided contexts. Thus, we calibrate using the original claim, which results in bad performances. It shows here that one limitation of the calibrator method is that it only applies to cases with provided relevant contexts.\n\nEven though this task does not require much reasoning, employing the Verify-and-Edit framework, we are able to observe consistent improvements over the baseline method. Similar to before, the Wikipedia retrieval is able to result in a larger improvement over DrQA, and Google search improves further at 1.9%.\n\nCompared to our method, ReAct is able to demonstrate a larger improvement on Fever. First of all, it has been mentioned before that Fever is less suited for the Verify-and-Edit framework as it\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} \\hline\n**Method** & **knowledge** & **EM** & \\(\\Delta\\)**EM** & **AUC** \\\\ \\hline Standard & - & 16.9\\% & - & 35.89 \\\\ CoT & - & 28.4\\% & - & 16.64 \\\\ CoT-SC & - & 27.7\\% & - & 17.16 \\\\ CoT-SC + Calib. & Dataset & - & - & 24.13 \\\\ CoT-SC + VE & Wiki. & 33.1\\% & +5.4\\% & 28.32 \\\\ CoT-SC + VE & DRQA & 31.1\\% & +3.4\\% & 27.75 \\\\ CoT-SC + VE & Google & 33.6\\% & +5.9\\% & 30.06 \\\\ CoT-SC + VE & Dataset & **37.2\\%** & **+9.5\\%** & **32.28** \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 2: Results on **2WikiMultiHopQA** dataset. \\(\\Delta\\)EM represents the improvement on Exact Match from the CoT-SC baseline.

Secondly, ReAct prompts are much longer than our prompts, requiring more computational costs.\n\n### Cost considerations\n\nAs cost reduction is a main concern when interacting with LLMs, our method takes it into consideration and attempts to reduce computational costs from two aspects: Firstly, Verify-and-Edit only makes edits for selected instances, whereas others edit every time. Specifically, we only revise when the model is uncertain (judged by consistency), which occurs 40% of the time. As a comparison, other methods, such as ReAct, retrieve relevant information and edit for every single instance, resulting in higher costs. Secondly, Verify-and-Edit designs tasks that are natural and conversational, requiring only a few demonstrations and short prompts to learn. For example, other methods usually learn non-natural calls, such as [thought] and [action] tags in ReAct and API calls in Toolformer (Schick et al., 2023). Therefore, the LLM requires longer prompts, more demonstrations, or even fine-tuning to learn the format. On the other hand, we design Verify-and-Edit tasks to be as natural as possible, requiring minimal effort to learn. Our tasks only consist of asking and answering questions, with no synthetic tags or tasks to be learned. As a comparison, with the GPT-3 API, for editing one Fever instance, Verify-and-Edit costs $0.014, whereas ReAct costs $0.017.\n\n### Evaluating the reasoning chains with human study\n\nTo closely examine the faithfulness of the generated reasoning chains, we also conduct a small-scale human study experiment. During the experiment, two human volunteers are shown 50 randomly selected questions with generated reasoning chains from CoT-SC and Verify-and-Edit on the HotpotQA dataset. They are then asked to select the more factually consistent one. Volunteers are encouraged to use search engines as assistance. A detailed description on the setup is described in Appendix D.\n\nShown in Table 4, humans select the reasoning chains produced by Verify-and-Edit as more factually consistent 53% of the time, compared to 17% for the CoT-SC baseline. The Cohen \\(\\kappa\\) is at 0.25, showing fair agreement between the two annotators (McHugh, 2012). The annotators used Google search as an assistive tool 100% of the time, which shows the necessity of introducing external knowledge.\n\nMoreover, human annotations in this case require a lot of efforts. Annotators report 1.5 minutes on average to validate one data point. Thus, automating the Verify-and-Edit process is of benefits as an assistive tool to reduce human labor.\n\nTo observe the qualitative effects of the Verify-and-Edit framework in detail, we also include several interesting examples in Appendix E, which show the effectiveness of our framework in correcting the original claims.\n\n### Ablation study: editing at different consistency thresholds\n\nIn the Verify-and-Edit framework, the only hyper-parameter to select is the consistency threshold. Similar thresholds also exists in ReAct (Yao et al., 2022), where the CoT \\(\\rightarrow\\) ReAct method is to employ ReAct-style prompting when \"the majority answer among n CoT-SC samples occurs less than n/2 times\". Using majority counts, however, is less fine-grained compared to using the original consistency formulated with log probablities. Thus, we employ the original score proposed by Wang et al. (2022), which is the unnormalized answer probabilities marginalized over the rationales' log probabilities. To mimic a majority-vote threshold, we select \\(\\lceil n/2\\rceil\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of sampled paths.\n\nTo study the effect of adjusting the consistency\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} \\hline \\hline\n**\\# Examples** & **Cohen \\(\\kappa\\)** & **CoT-SC** & **Ours** & **Tie** \\\\\n50 & 0.25 & 17\\% & **53\\%** & 30\\% \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 4: Human study for factuality of CoTs on the HotpotQA dataset. \u201cOurs\u201d refers to the Verify-and-Edit model with Google retrieval.\n\nFigure 3: Ablation study on the effect of various consistency thresholds on task performances on Adversarial HotpotQA\n\nthreshold on our framework, we show the ablation results of Adversarial HotpotQA in Fig. 3. As the threshold increases, accuracy first increases, reaching a peak close to \\(\\lceil n/2\\rceil\\), which is 3, before decreasing. The AUC scores demonstrate a similar trend.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 2, when consistency is larger than majority (\\(\\lceil n/2\\rceil\\)), there are usually more correct predictions rather than incorrect predictions, and vice versa. Thus, as we increase the consistency threshold from 0 to \\(\\lceil n/2\\rceil\\), more uncertain and possibly incorrect samples are getting edited by introducing external knowledge. As we go beyond the ideal threshold \\(\\lceil n/2\\rceil\\), we are mostly re-editing correct samples, and the introduced noise may disrupt the original reasoning chains.\n\nThus, we recommend a consistency threshold at \\(\\lceil n/2\\rceil\\) as an ideal level.\n\n## 6 Conclusions\n\nIn this paper, we introduce a Verify-and-Edit framework for open-domain question-answering. It is a first attempt to post-edit CoT-style reasoning chains for better end-task performance. By combining knowledge retrieval with reasoning, the framework edits CoTs in a natural and conversational way, which enhances prediction factuality. Combined with Google search, the framework also shows a promising direction that combines the open-generation ability of state-of-art LLMs with the updated facts provided by search engines.\n\n## Limitations\n\nThere are a few limitations to the current framework. Firstly, Verify-and-Edit works the best for open-domain question-answering tasks that require complex reasoning. Less complex datasets or commonsense datasets that do not require knowledge retrieval may not result in high improvements. Secondly, it is most ideal to edit a group of mostly incorrect samples, which we try to select by using consistency. Thus, our method is reliant on the consistency method's performance and its abilities to separate correct and incorrect predictions. Most often, it can demonstrate a larger improvement with a more challenging set of examples.\n\nTo address these limitations, we plan to work on reducing the noise brought in the rationale-editing stage and utilize more knowledge resources, such as knowledge bases, as a follow-up.\n\n## Ethics Statement\n\nThe Verify-and-Edit framework can mitigate potential ethical concerns of LLM generation surrounding hallucinations and unfactual details. Some persisting concerns include: (1) As the framework uses google as one of the retrieval methods, it could retrieve potentially toxic information that exists in google search results. (2) As the framework uses GPT3 as a backbone, it could suffer from existing ethical concerns of GPT3, such as responding to toxic queries or exhibiting biased behavior.\n\nFor knowledge retrieval, we used Wikipedia corpus and google search results.

(2) Set of adversarial contexts is reduced to two ground truth supporting paragraphs and two adversarial paragraphs, instead of using all eight distractors. Each paragraph is further simplified by only keeping relevant sentences needed for answering the question (or distracting the prediction) (3) A challenging test set of 250 examples is formed by balancing the mix of examples on which prompted text-davinci-001 (which is used at their time of experiments) to make correct and incorrect predictions. This is done by first running few-shot inference over 1000 examples, and then randomly sampling 125 examples with correct and incorrect predictions, respectively.

The volunteers are NLP Ph.D. students who are proficient in English. The volunteers understand the use for the data collection and are in consensus. The reasoning chain 1 and 2 are CoTs generated by the CoT-SC baseline and the Verify-and-Edit shown in random order. On average, each volunteer took 1.25 hours to finish 50 samples.\n\n## Appendix E Qualitative Examples\n\nIn Table 5, 3 examples from the Adversarial HotpotQA datasets are shown in detail.\n\nFrom the first sample, the LLM incorrectly states that the song is \"based on.. Spider-Man.\" However, in the Google retrieved facts, it clearly states that it is based on \"Ghost Rider\". Therefore, the retrieved fact is able to help correct the detail in the rationale. Moreover, although the original rationale also covered the brand name \"Marvel Comics\", the generation goes on with the hero name as an answer, instead of the \"brand\" being asked. Feeding in again also corrects that logical mistake.\n\nIn the second example, the LLM makes up a plausible-sounding fact that \"Tony Robinson has written seven children's books\". There is also no indicator on the LLM's confidence level of this claim. Thus, if a user is unfamiliar with this knowledge, it could easily be mistaken as a true fact, which is highly risky. By introducing Google as an assistive tool, we retrieve the sentence \"he has published 16 children's books.\" With this newly retrieved fact in mind, the LLM goes on generating the correct answer.\n\nThe third example is an interesting one. The original CoT already makes mistakes in the first sentence and goes on making continued mistakes in the second sentence as well. This is a type of common mistake in the dataset as well. On correcting them, the Verify-and-Edit framework is able to correct the first claim with the show \"Chelsea Does\". The second claim, however, is verified but irrelevant to the original question anymore. In this case, by feeding in both rationale sentences, the LLM is able to select the relevant fact as an answer, while disregarding the rest. This example shows that the CoT setup used by Verify-and-Edit is important as it allows for models to reason and abstract for a second time, instead of plainly replacing and correcting.\n\nFigure 4: Example Screenshot of Human Evaluation User Interface.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l l} \\hline Original Question & Suicide\u2019s 1977 released album features a song based on what brand\u2019s comic character? \\\\ True Answer & Marvel Comics \\\\ CoT-SC & First, Suicide released their 1977 album titled Suicide: Alan Vega \\& Martin Rev. \\\\  & Second, the album features a song based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man. \\\\  & The answer is Spider-Man. \\\\ Verifying Questions & What album was released by Suicide in 1977? \\\\  & What comic character is the song on Suicide\u2019s 1977 album based on? \\\\ Retrieved Facts & Suicide is the debut studio album from the American rock band Suicide.

This means they can fall short in\ntasks that require exploration, strategic lookahead, or where initial decisions play\na pivotal role. To surmount these challenges, we introduce a new framework for\nlanguage model inference, \u201cTree of Thoughts\u201d (ToT), which generalizes over the\npopular \u201cChain of Thought\u201d approach to prompting language models, and enables\nexploration over coherent units of text (\u201cthoughts\u201d) that serve as intermediate steps\ntoward problem solving. ToT allows LMs to perform deliberate decision making\nby considering multiple different reasoning paths and self-evaluating choices to\ndecide the next course of action, as well as looking ahead or backtracking when\nnecessary to make global choices. Our experiments show that ToT significantly\nenhances language models\u2019 problem-solving abilities on three novel tasks requiring\nnon-trivial planning or search: Game of 24, Creative Writing, and Mini Crosswords.\nFor instance, in Game of 24, while GPT-4 with chain-of-thought prompting only\nsolved 4% of tasks, our method achieved a success rate of 74%. Code repo with all\nprompts: https://github.com/ysymyth/tree-of-thought-llm.\n1\nIntroduction\nOriginally designed to generate text, scaled-up versions of language models (LMs) such as GPT [22,\n23, 1, 20] and PaLM [5] have been shown to be increasingly capable of performing an ever wider\nrange of tasks requiring mathematical, symbolic, commonsense, and knowledge reasoning. It is\nperhaps surprising that underlying all this progress is still the original autoregressive mechanism for\ngenerating text, which makes token-level decisions one by one and in a left-to-right fashion. Is such\na simple mechanism sufficient for a LM to be built toward a general problem solver? If not, what\nproblems would challenge the current paradigm, and what should be alternative mechanisms?\nThe literature on human cognition provides some clues to answer these questions. Research on \u201cdual\nprocess\u201d models suggests that people have two modes in which they engage with decisions \u2013 a fast,\nautomatic, unconscious mode (\u201cSystem 1\u201d) and a slow, deliberate, conscious mode (\u201cSystem 2\u201d)\n[27, 28, 13, 12]. These two modes have previously been connected to a variety of mathematical\nmodels used in machine learning. For example, research on reinforcement learning in humans and\nother animals has explored the circumstances under which they engage in associative \u201cmodel free\u201d\nlearning or more deliberative \u201cmodel based\u201d planning [6]. The simple associative token-level choices\nof LMs are also reminiscent of \u201cSystem 1\u201d, and thus might benefit from augmentation by a more\ndeliberate \u201cSystem 2\u201d planning process that (1) maintains and explores diverse alternatives for current\nPreprint.

See concrete examples of how thoughts are generated, evaluated, and\nsearched in Figures 2,4,6.\nchoices instead of just picking one, and (2) evaluates its current status and actively looks ahead or\nbacktracks to make more global decisions.\nTo design such a planning process, we return to the origins of artificial intelligence (and cognitive\nscience), drawing inspiration from the planning processes explored by Newell, Shaw, and Simon\nstarting in the 1950s [18, 19]. Newell and colleagues characterized problem solving [18] as search\nthrough a combinatorial problem space, represented as a tree. We thus propose the Tree of Thoughts\n(ToT) framework for general problem solving with language models. As Figure 1 illustrates, while\nexisting methods (detailed below) sample continuous language sequences for problem solving, ToT\nactively maintains a tree of thoughts, where each thought is a coherent language sequence that serves\nas an intermediate step toward problem solving (Table 1). Such a high-level semantic unit allows the\nLM to self-evaluate the progress different intermediate thoughts make towards solving the problem\nthrough a deliberate reasoning process that is also instantiated in language (Figures 2,4,6). This\nimplementation of search heuristics via LM self-evaluation and deliberation is novel, as previous\nsearch heuristics are either programmed or learned. Finally, we combine this language-based\ncapability to generate and evaluate diverse thoughts with search algorithms, such as breadth-first\nsearch (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS), which allow systematic exploration of the tree of thoughts\nwith lookahead and backtracking.\nEmpirically, we propose three new problems that challenge existing LM inference methods even with\nthe state-of-the-art language model, GPT-4 [20]: Game of 24, Creative Writing, and Crosswords\n(Table 1). These tasks require deductive, mathematical, commonsense, lexical reasoning abilities,\nand a way to incorporate systematic planning or search. We show ToT obtains superior results on\nall three tasks by being general and flexible enough to support different levels of thoughts, different\nways to generate and evaluate thoughts, and different search algorithms that adapt to the nature of\ndifferent problems. We also analyze how such choices affect model performances via systematic\nablations and discuss future directions to better train and use LMs.\n2\nBackground\nWe first formalize some existing methods that use large language models for problem-solving,\nwhich our approach is inspired by and later compared with. We use p\u03b8 to denote a pre-trained LM\nwith parameters \u03b8, and lowercase letters x, y, z, s, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 to denote a language sequence, i.e. x =\n(x[1], \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , x[n]) where each x[i] is a token, so that p\u03b8(x) = \ufffdn\ni=1 p\u03b8(x[i]|x[1...i]). We use uppercase\nletters S, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 to denote a collection of language sequences.\nInput-output (IO) prompting is the most common way to turn a problem input x into output y with\nLM: y \u223c p\u03b8(y|promptIO(x)), where promptIO(x) wraps input x with task instructions and/or fewshot input-output examples. For simplicity, let us denote pprompt\n\u03b8\n(output | input) = p\u03b8(output |\nprompt(input)), so that IO prompting can be formulated as y \u223c pIO\n\u03b8 (y|x).\n2\n\fChain-of-thought (CoT) prompting [35] was proposed to address cases where the mapping of\ninput x to output y is non-trivial (e.g. when x is a math question and y is the final numerical answer).\nThe key idea is to introduce a chain of thoughts z1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , zn to bridge x and y, where each zi is a\ncoherent language sequence that serves as a meaningful intermediate step toward problem solving\n(e.g. zi could be an intermediate equation for math QA). To solve problems with CoT, each thought\nzi \u223c pCoT\n\u03b8\n(zi | x, z1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7i\u22121) is sampled sequentially, then the output y \u223c pCoT\n\u03b8\n(y|x, z1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7n). In\npractice, [z1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7n, y] \u223c pCoT\n\u03b8\n(z1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7n, y|x) is sampled as a continuous language sequence, and the\ndecomposition of thoughts (e.g. is each zi a phrase, a sentence, or a paragraph) is left ambiguous.\nSelf-consistency with CoT (CoT-SC) [33] is an ensemble approach that samples k i.i.d. chains\nof thought: [z(i)\n1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7n, y(i)] \u223c pCoT\n\u03b8\n(z1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7n, y|x) (i = 1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 k), then returns the most frequent output:\narg maxy #{i | y(i) = y}. CoT-SC improves upon CoT, because there are generally different\nthought processes for the same problem (e.g. different ways to prove the same theorem), and the\noutput decision can be more faithful by exploring a richer set of thoughts. However, within each\nchain there is no local exploration of different thought steps, and the \u201cmost frequent\u201d heuristic only\napplies when the output space is limited (e.g. multi-choice QA).\n3\nTree of Thoughts: Deliberate Problem Solving with LM\nA genuine problem-solving process involves the repeated use of available information to initiate exploration, which discloses, in turn, more information until a way\nto attain the solution is finally discovered.\u2014\u2014 Newell et al. [18]\nResearch on human problem-solving suggests that people search through a combinatorial problemspace \u2013 a tree where the nodes represent partial solutions, and the branches correspond to operators\nthat modify them [18, 19]. Which branch to take is determined by heuristics that help to navigate the\nproblem-space and guide the problem-solver towards a solution. This perspective highlights two key\nshortcomings of existing approaches that use LMs to solve general problems: 1) Locally, they do not\nexplore different continuations within a thought process \u2013 the branches of the tree. 2) Globally, they\ndo not incorporate any type of planning, lookahead, or backtracking to help evaluate these different\noptions \u2013 the kind of heuristic-guided search that seems characteristic of human problem-solving.\nTo address these shortcomings, we introduce Tree of Thoughts (ToT), a paradigm that allows LMs to\nexplore multiple reasoning paths over thoughts (Figure 1(c)). ToT frames any problem as a search\nover a tree, where each node is a state s = [x, z1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7i] representing a partial solution with the input and\nthe sequence of thoughts so far. A specific instantiation of ToT involves answering four questions:\n1. How to decompose the intermediate process into thought steps; 2. How to generate potential\nthoughts from each state; 3. How to heuristically evaluate states; 4. What search algorithm to use.\n1. Thought decomposition. While CoT samples thoughts coherently without explicit decomposition,\nToT leverages problem properties to design and decompose intermediate thought steps. As Table 1\nshows, depending on different problems, a thought could be a couple of words (Crosswords), a line of\nequation (Game of 24), or a whole paragraph of writing plan (Creative Writing). In general, a thought\nshould be \u201csmall\u201d enough so that LMs can generate promising and diverse samples (e.g. generating\na whole book is usually too \u201cbig\u201d to be coherent), yet \u201cbig\u201d enough so that LMs can evaluate its\nprospect toward problem solving (e.g. generating one token is usually too \u201csmall\u201d to evaluate).\n2. Thought generator G(p\u03b8, s, k). Given a tree state s = [x, z1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7i], we consider two strategies to\ngenerate k candidates for the next thought step:\n(a) Sample i.i.d. thoughts from a CoT prompt (Creative Writing, Figure 4):\nz(j)\n\u223c\npCoT\n\u03b8\n(zi+1|s) = pCoT\n\u03b8\n(zi+1|x, z1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7i) (j = 1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 k). This works better when the thought\nspace is rich (e.g. each thought is a paragraph), and i.i.d. samples lead to diversity;\n(b) Propose thoughts sequentially using a \u201cpropose prompt\u201d (Game of 24, Figure 2; Crosswords,\nFigure 6): [z(1), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , z(k)] \u223c ppropose\n\u03b8\n(z(1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7k)\ni+1\n| s). This works better when the thought\nspace is more constrained (e.g. each thought is just a word or a line), so proposing different\nthoughts in the same context avoids duplication.\n3. State evaluator V (p\u03b8, S). Given a frontier of different states, the state evaluator evaluates the\nprogress they make towards solving the problem, serving as a heuristic for the search algorithm\nto determine which states to keep exploring and in which order. While heuristics are a standard\napproach to solving search problems, they are typically either programmed (e.g. DeepBlue [3]) or\n3\n\flearned (e.g. AlphaGo [26]). We propose a third alternative, by using the LM to deliberately reason\nabout states. When applicable, such a deliberate heuristic can be more flexible than programmed\nrules, and more sample-efficient than learned models. Similar to the thought generator, we consider\ntwo strategies to evaluate states either independently or together:\n(a) Value each state independently: V (p\u03b8, S)(s) \u223c pvalue\n\u03b8\n(v|s) \u2200s \u2208 S, where a value\nprompt reasons about the state s to generate a scalar value v (e.g. 1-10) or a classification (e.g. sure/likely/impossible) that could be heuristically turned into a value. The basis\nof such evaluative reasoning can vary across problems and thought steps. In this work, we\nexplore evaluation via few lookahead simulations (e.g. quickly confirm that 5, 5, 14 can\nreach 24 via 5 + 5 + 14, or \u201chot l\u201d can mean \u201cinn\u201d via filling \u201ce\u201d in \u201c \u201d) plus commonsense\n(e.g. 1 2 3 are too small to reach 24, or no word can start with \u201ctzxc\u201d). While the former\nmight promote \u201cgood\u201d states, the latter could help eliminate \u201cbad\u201d states. Such valuations\ndo not need to be perfect, and only need to be approximately\n(b) Vote across states: V (p\u03b8, S)(s) = 1[s = s\u2217], where a \u201cgood\u201d state s\u2217 \u223c pvote\n\u03b8\n(s\u2217|S) is\nvoted out based on deliberately comparing different states in S in a vote prompt. When\nproblem success is harder to directly value (e.g. passage coherency), it is natural to to instead\ncompare different partial solutions and vote for the most promising one. This is similar\nin spirit to a \u201cstep-wise\u201d self-consistency strategy, i.e. cast \u201cwhich state to explore\u201d as a\nmulti-choice QA, and use LM samples to vote for it.\nFor both strategies, we could prompt the LM multiple times to aggregate the value or vote results to\ntrade time/resource/cost for more faithful/robust heuristics.\nAlgorithm 1 ToT-BFS(x, p\u03b8, G, k, V, T, b)\nRequire: Input x, LM p\u03b8, thought generator G()\n& size limit k, states evaluator V (), step limit T,\nbreadth limit b.\nS0 \u2190 {x}\nfor t = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , T do\nS\u2032\nt \u2190 {[s, z] | s \u2208 St\u22121, zt \u2208 G(p\u03b8, s, k)}\nVt \u2190 V (p\u03b8, S\u2032\nt)\nSt \u2190 arg maxS\u2282S\u2032\nt,|S|=b\n\ufffd\ns\u2208S Vt(s)\nend for\nreturn G(p\u03b8, arg maxs\u2208ST VT (s), 1)\nAlgorithm 2 ToT-DFS(s, t, p\u03b8, G, k, V, T, vth)\nRequire: Current state s, step t, LM p\u03b8, thought\ngenerator G() and size limit k, states evaluator\nV (), step limit T, threshold vth\nif t > T then record output G(p\u03b8, s, 1)\nend if\nfor s\u2032 \u2208 G(p\u03b8, s, k) do\n\u25b7 sorted candidates\nif V (p\u03b8, {s\u2032})(s) > vthres then \u25b7 pruning\nDFS(s\u2032, t + 1)\nend if\nend for\n4. Search algorithm. Finally, within the ToT framework, one can plug and play different search\nalgorithms depending on the tree structure. We explore two relatively simple search algorithms and\nleave more advanced ones (e.g. A* [9], MCTS [2]) for future work:\n(a) Breadth-first search (BFS) (Algorithm 1) maintains a set of the b most promising states\nper step. This is used for Game of 24 and Creative Writing where the tree depth is limit\n(T \u2264 3), and initial thought steps can be evaluated and pruned to a small set (b \u2264 5).\n(b) Depth-first search (DFS) (Algorithm 2) explores the most promising state first, until the\nfinal output is reached (t > T), or the state evaluator deems it impossible to solve the\nproblem from the current s (V (p\u03b8, {s})(s) \u2264 vth for a value threshold vth). In the latter\ncase, the subtree from s is pruned to trade exploration for exploitation. In both cases, DFS\nbacktracks to the parent state of s to continue exploration.\nConceptually, ToT has several benefits as a method for general problem-solving with LMs: (1) Generality. IO, CoT, CoT-SC, and self-refinement can be seen as special cases of ToT (i.e. trees of limited\ndepth and breadth; Figure 1). (2) Modularity. The base LM, as well as the thought decomposition,\ngeneration, evaluation, and search procedures can all be varied independently. (3) Adaptability.\nDifferent problem properties, LM capabilities, and resource constraints can be accommodated. (4)\nConvenience. No extra training is needed, just a pre-trained LM is sufficient. The next section will\nshow how these conceptual benefits translate to strong empirical performance in different problems.\n4\nExperiments\nWe propose three tasks that are hard even when sampling from the state-of-the-art language model,\nGPT-4 [20], using standard IO prompting or chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting.

2: ToT in a game of 24. The LM is prompted for (a) thought generation and (b) valuation.\nTask Setup. We scrape data from 4nums.com, which has 1,362 games that are sorted from easy to\nhard by human solving time, and use a subset of relatively hard games indexed 901-1,000 for testing.\nFor each task, we consider the output as success if it is a valid equation that equals 24 and uses the\ninput numbers each exactly once. We report the success rate across 100 games as the metric.\nBaselines. We use a standard input-output (IO) prompt with 5 in-context examples. For chain-ofthought (CoT) prompting, we augment each input-output pair with 3 intermediate equations, each\noperating on two remaining numbers. For example, given input \u201c4 9 10 13\u201d, the thoughts could be\n\u201c13 - 9 = 4 (left: 4 4 10); 10 - 4 = 6 (left: 4 6); 4 * 6 = 24 (left: 24)\u201d. For each game, we sample IO\nand CoT prompting for 100 times for average performance. We also consider a CoT self-consistency\nbaseline, which takes the majority output from 100 CoT samples, and an iterative-refine approach on\ntop of an IO sample for at most 10 iterations. At each iteration, the LM is conditioned on all previous\nhistory to \u201creflect on your mistakes and generate a refined answer\u201d if the output is incorrect. Note\nthat it uses groundtruth feedback signals about equation correctness.\nToT Setup. To frame Game of 24 into ToT, it is natural to decompose the thoughts into 3 steps,\neach an intermediate equation. As shown in Figure 2(a), at each tree node, we exact the \u201cleft\u201d\nnumbers and prompt the LM to propose some possible next steps. The same \u201cpropose prompt\u201d is\nused for all 3 thought steps, though it only has one example with 4 input numbers. We perform a\nbreadth-first search (BFS) in ToT, where at each step we keep the best b = 5 candidates. To perform\ndeliberate BFS in ToT, as shown in Figure 2(b), we prompt LM to evaluate each thought candidate as\n\u201csure/maybe/impossible\u201d with regard to reaching 24. The aim is to promote correct partial solutions\nthat can be verdicted within few lookahead trials, and eliminate impossible partial solutions based on\n\u201ctoo big/small\u201d commonsense, and keep the rest \u201cmaybe\u201d. We sample values 3 times for each thought.\n1Experiments were done between May 5-16, 2023.\n5\n\fMethod\nSuccess\nIO prompt\n7.3%\nCoT prompt\n4.0%\nCoT-SC (k=100)\n9.0%\nToT (ours) (b=1)\n45%\nToT (ours) (b=5)\n74%\nIO + Refine (k=10)\n27%\nIO (best of 100)\n33%\nCoT (best of 100)\n49%\nTable 2: Game of 24 Results.\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n(a) Success rate with nodes visited\nIO (best of k)\nCoT (best of k)\nToT (b=1...5)\n1\n2\n3\n4\nCorrect\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n(b) Samples failed at each step\nCoT\nToT (b=5)\nFigure 3: Game of 24 (a) scale analysis & (b) error analysis.\nResults. As shown in Table 2, IO, CoT, and CoT-SC prompting methods perform badly on the task,\nachieving only 7.3%, 4.0%, and 9.0% success rates. In contrast, ToT with a breadth of b = 1 already\nachieves a success rate of 45%, while b = 5 achieves 74%. We also consider an oracle setup for\nIO/CoT, by calculating the success rate using best of k samples (1 \u2264 k \u2264 100). To compare IO/CoT\n(best of k) with ToT, we consider calculating the tree nodes visited per task in ToT across b = 1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 5,\nand map the 5 success rates in Figure 3(a), treating IO/CoT (best of k) as visiting k nodes in a bandit.\nNot surprisingly, CoT scales better than IO, and best of 100 CoT samples achieve a success rate of\n49%, but still much worse than exploring more nodes in ToT (b > 1).\nError Analysis. Figure 3(b) breaks down at which step CoT and ToT samples fail the task, i.e. the\nthought (in CoT) or all b thoughts (in ToT) are invalid or impossible to reach 24. Notably, around\n60% of CoT samples already failed the task after generating the first step, or equivalently, the first\nthree words (e.g. \u201c4 + 9\u201d). This highlights the issues with direct left-to-right decoding.\n4.2\nCreative writing\nNext, we invent a creative writing task where the input is 4 random sentences and the output should\nbe a coherent passage with 4 paragraphs that end in the 4 input sentences respectively. Such a task is\nopen-ended and exploratory, and challenges creative thinking as well as high-level planning.\nTask setup. We sample random sentences from randomwordgenerator.com to form 100 inputs, and\nthere is no groundtruth passage for each input constraint. As we find that GPT-4 can follow the\ninput constraints most of the time, we focus on evaluating passage coherency in two ways: using a\nGPT-4 zero-shot prompt to provide a 1-10 scalar score, or using human judgments to compare pairs\nof outputs from different methods. For the former, we sample 5 scores and average them for each task\noutput, and we find these 5 scores usually consistent, with a standard deviation of around 0.56 on\naverage across outputs. For the latter, we employ a subset of the authors in a blind study to compare\nthe coherency of CoT vs. ToT generated passage pairs, where the order of passages is random flipped\nover 100 inputs.\nBaselines. Given the creative nature of the task, both IO and CoT prompts are zero-shot. While the\nformer prompts the LM to directly generate a coherent passage given input constraints, the latter\nprompts the LM to first make a brief plan then write the passage, i.e. the plan serves as the intermediate\nthought step. We generate 10 IO and CoT samples per task. We also consider an iterative-refine\n(k \u2264 5) method on top of a random IO sample for each task, where the LM is conditioned on input\nconstraints and the last generated passage to decide if the passage is already \u201cperfectly coherent\u201d,\nand if not generate a refined one.\nToT setup. We build a ToT with depth 2 (and only 1 intermediate thought step) \u2014 the LM first\ngenerates k = 5 plans and votes for the best one (Figure 4), then similarly generate k = 5 passages\nbased on the best plan then vote for the best one. Here the breadth limit b = 1, as only one choice is\nkept per step. A simple zero-shot vote prompt (\u201canalyze choices below, then conclude which is most\npromising for the instruction\u201d) is used to sample 5 votes at both steps.\nResults. Figure 5(a) shows average GPT-4 scores across 100 tasks, where ToT (7.56) is deemed to\ngenerate more coherent passages than IO (6.19) and CoT (6.93) on average. While such an automatic\nmetric might be noisy, Figure 5(b) confirms the finding by showing that humans prefer ToT over\nCoT in 41 out of 100 passage pairs, while only prefer CoT over ToT in 21 (other 38 pairs are found\n\u201csimilarly coherent\u201d). Lastly, iterative-refine is more effective on this natural language task,

As\nwe observe adjacent games contain similar clues, we use 20 games with indices 1, 6, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 91, 96 for\ntesting, and games 136, 141, 146, 151, 156 for prompting. For each task, the input describes the 5\nhorizontal clues and 5 vertical clues, and the output should be a board of 5 \u00d7 5 = 25 letters to solve\nthe crosswords. For evaluation, we consider three levels of success: the portion of correct letters (25\nper game), words (10 per game), and games.\nBaselines. We provide 5 example input-output pairs in the IO prompt, and in the CoT prompt\nadditionally include intermediate words in the order h1..5 then v1..5. We run each prompt for 10\nsamples and average the results.\nToT Setup. We leverage a depth-first search (Algorithm 2) that keeps exploring the most promising\nsubsequent word clue until the state is no longer promising, then backtrack to the parent state to\nexplore alternative thoughts. To make search tractable, subsequent thoughts are constrained not to\nchange any filled words or letters, so that the ToT has at most 10 intermediate steps. For thought\ngeneration, at each state we translate all existing thoughts (e.g. \u201ch2.motor; h1.tasks\u201d for the state\nin Figure 6(a)) into letter constraints for remaining clues (e.g. \u201cv1.To heap: tm\n;...\u201d) and prompt\na proposal prompt 5 times to come up with candidates for where and what to fill in the next word.\nImportantly, we also prompt the LM to give a confidence level for different thoughts, and aggregate\n7\n\f\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\nFigure 6: In Mini Crosswords, (a) how thoughts are proposed and aggregated in a priority queue\nfor depth-first search (DFS), and (b) how a state is evaluated based on the possibility of filling in\neach remaining word clue, and pruned if any remaining clue is deemed not possible to fill by the LM.\nThen DFS backtracks to the parent state and explore the next promising thought for clue.\nthese across proposals to obtain a sorted list of next thoughts to explore (Figure 6(a)). For state\nevaluations, we similarly translate each state into letter constraints for remaining clues, then evaluate\nfor each clue if it is possible to fill given the constraints. If any remaining clue is deemed \u201cimpossible\u201d\nto fill in (e.g. \u201cv1. To heap: tm s \u201d), then the exploration of the state\u2019s subtree is pruned and DFS\nbacktracks to its parent to explore the next promising thought. We limit DFS search steps to 100, and\nsimply render the deepest explored state (the first explored one if multiple) into the final output.\nResults. As shown in Table 3, IO and CoT prompting methods perform poorly with a word-level\nsuccess rate less than 16%, while ToT significantly improves all metrics, achieving a word-level\nsuccess rate of 60% and solving 4 out of 20 games. Such an improvement is not surprising, given IO\nand CoT lack mechanisms to try different clues, make changes to decisions, or backtrack.\nOracle and ablation studies. When outputting from the oracle best DFS state (instead of the\nheuristically determined best state) per task, ToT performance is even higher and actually solves\n7/20 games (Table 3, \u201c+best state\u201d), indicating our simple output heuristics can be readily improved.\nInterestingly, sometimes when the crosswords game is actually solved, the state evaluator might still\ndeem some words as \u201cimpossible\u201d and prune \u2014 possibly because 5 \u00d7 5 crosswords by design have\nsome rare or obselete words that GPT-4 cannot recognize2. Given the state evaluation as a pruning\nheuristic is imperfect, we also explore ablating the pruning, and find the performance generally worse\n(Table 3, \u201c-prune\u201d). However, it could actually find the correct solution for 4/20 games (though only\noutputting 1 via heuristic), 3 of which are games ToT+pruning cannot solve within 100 steps. Thus,\nbetter heuristics for DFS pruning are critical for problem solving in this case. Lastly, we confirm the\nimportance of backtracking by running an ablation that keeps filling the most promising clue for at\nmost 20 steps, allowing overwrites. This is similar to a \u201cgreedy\u201d BFS search with breadth limit of\nb = 1, and performs poorly with a word level success of only 20% (Table 3, \u201c-backtrack\u201d).\n5\nRelated Work\nPlanning and decision making. Smart planning and decision making are critical to achieving\npredefined goals. As they are trained on vast amount of world knowledge and human examples, LMs\nare known to have already absorbed rich commonsense that makes it possible to propose reasonable\nplans conditioned on problem setting and environmental states [10, 39, 34, 11, 32, 38, 37]. Our\nproposed Tree-of-Thought approach extends existing planning formulations by considering multiple\npotentially feasible plans simultaneously at each problem-solving step, and proceeding with the most\npromising ones. The integration between thought sampling and value feedback organically integrates\nplanning and decision-making mechanisms, enabling effective search inside a solution tree. On the\nother hand, traditional decision-making procedures usually require training dedicated reward and\npolicy models as in reinforcement learning (for example CHAI [30]), whereas we use the LM itself\nto provide the value estimates for decision making.\n2For example, \u201cagend\u201d is an obsolete form of \u201cagendum\u201d, but GPT-4 deems it a typo for \u201cagenda\u201d. External\nretrieval or web interaction could augment LM for problem solving under knowledge uncertainty.\n8\n\fSelf-reflection. Using LLMs to assess the viability of their own predictions is becoming an increasingly important procedure in problem solving. [25, 17, 21] introduced the \u201cself-reflection\u201d\nmechanism, in which LMs provide feedback to their generation candidates. [4] improves LMs code\ngeneration accuracy by injecting feedback messages generated by the LM itself based on its code\nexecution results. Similarly, [14] also introduces \u201ccritic\u201d or review steps over the actions and states,\ndeciding the next action to take in solving computer operation tasks. Another recent work very\nrelevant to ours is \u201cself-eval guided decoding\u201d [36]. Similar to our method, self-eval decoding\nalso follows a tree-search procedure with leaves sampled from stochastic beam search decoding,\nwhich are then evaluated by LLM itself with carefully prepared self-eval prompts. Their approach\nhowever, uses the PAL formulation [7] which represents thoughts as codes, which makes it difficult\nto tackle challenging tasks like creative writing which we consider in this paper. Our Tree-of-Thought\nformulation is thus more versatile and handles challenging tasks on which GPT-4 only achieves very\nlow accuracy with standard prompts.\nProgram-guided LLM generation. Our proposal is also related to recent advancements that organize LM\u2019s behavior with symbolic program guidance. For example [24] embeds LMs in an\nalgorithmic search procedure to help solve problems like question answering step-by-step, in which\nthe search trees are expanded by relevant paragraphs that might provide answers. This approach\nhowever differs from ours in that trees are expanded by sampling external paragraphs instead of the\nLM\u2019s own thoughts, and there is no reflection or voting steps. Another approach, LLM+P [15], goes\none step further and delegates the actual planning process to a classical planner.\nClassical search methods. Last but not least, our approach can be treated as a modern rendition\nof classical search methods for problem solving. For example it can be considered as a heuristic\nsearch algorithm like A* [8], in which the heuristic at each search node is provided by the LM\u2019s\nself-assessment. From this perspective, our method is also related to NeuroLogic A*esque decoding\nproposed in [16], which is inspired by A* search but introduces look-ahead heuristics that are\nefficient for LMs to improve the beam-search or top-k sampling decoding. This method however is\nconstrained to sentence generation tasks, whereas our framework are designed for complex, multi-step\nproblem solving guarded by value feedback.\n6\nDiscussion\nLimitations and future directions. Deliberate search such as ToT might not be necessary for\nmany existing tasks that GPT-4 already excels at, and as an initial step this work only explores\nthree relatively simple tasks that challenges GPT-4 and calls of better search and planning abilities\nincorporated with LMs. However, as we begin to deploy LMs for more real-world decision making\napplications (e.g. coding, data analysis, robotics, etc.), more complex tasks could emerge and present\nnew opportunities to study these research questions. Also, search methods like ToT requires more\nresources (e.g. GPT-4 API cost) than sampling methods in order to improve task performances,\nbut the modular flexibility of ToT allows users to customize such performance-cost tradeoffs, and\nongoing open-source efforts [29] should readily reduce such costs in the near future. Lastly, this work\nfocuses on using an off-the-shelf LM, and fine-tuning LMs using a ToT-style high-level counterfactual\ndecision making (e.g. deliberating over potential choices for the next paragraph, instead of predicting\nthe next token) might present opportunities to enhance the problem-solving capabilities of LMs.\nBroader impact. ToT is a framework that empowers LMs to more autonomously and intelligently\nmake decisions and solve problems. While current tasks are limited to reasoning and search problems,\nfuture applications involving interaction with external environments or humans could bring potential\ndanger, e.g. facilitating harmful uses of LMs. On the other hand, ToT also improves the interpretability\nof model decisions and the opportunity for human alignment, as the resulting representations are\nreadable, high-level language reasoning instead of implicit, low-level token values.\nConclusion. The associative \u201cSystem 1\u201d of LMs can be beneficially augmented by a \u201cSystem 2\u201d\nbased on searching a tree of possible paths to the solution to a problem. The Tree of Thoughts\nframework provides a way to translate classical insights about problem-solving into actionable\nmethods for contemporary LMs. At the same time, LMs address a weakness of these classical\nmethods, providing a way to solve complex problems that are not easily formalized, such as creative\nwriting. We see this intersection of LMs with classical approaches to AI as an exciting direction for\nfuture work.\n9\n\fReferences\n[1] T. Brown, B. Mann, N. Ryder, M. Subbiah, J. D. Kaplan, P. Dhariwal, A.

Verification/refinement focuses on ensuring the correctness and reliability of reasoning processes, while planning aims to generate coherent and goal-oriented chains of thought. In this section, we will compare these two approaches and discuss their strengths and limitations.\n\nThe verification/refinement approach emphasizes the rigorous validation of reasoning steps and answers [REF0]. It introduces a framework for deductive reasoning that utilizes a \"Natural Program\" format, which is suitable for verification and can be generated through in-context learning [REF0]. This approach demonstrates the superiority of the framework in improving the rigor, trustworthiness, and interpretability of reasoning steps and answers [REF0]. Additionally, the introduction of a Unanimity-Plurality Voting strategy further enhances the accuracy of verification [REF2]. By mitigating hallucinations and reasoning errors of large language models (LLMs), this approach addresses the issue of misleading users when engaging in complex reasoning chains [REF2]. However, it is important to note that this approach does not completely eliminate harmful and biased content produced by LLMs [REF2].\n\nOn the other hand, the planning approach focuses on generating coherent and goal-oriented chains of thought. It leverages the memory components of short-term and long-term memory to provide context and recall important experiences [REF4]. By conditioning decisions on these memory components, planning agents can produce chains of thought that are specific and influenced by lessons learned over several trials [REF4]. This approach offers a way to solve complex problems that are not easily formalized, such as creative writing [REF9]. However, it is important to consider that planning may not guarantee the correctness and reliability of reasoning steps and answers, as it primarily focuses on generating coherent chains of thought.\n\nIn terms of verification and validation, the verification/refinement approach emphasizes the importance of rigorous checks to ensure the correctness of reasoning steps [REF3]. It follows a step-by-step reasoning chain decomposition and includes only the necessary context and premises for verification, improving the accuracy of reasoning chain validation [REF5]. On the other hand, planning does not inherently include explicit verification steps, as its focus is on generating coherent chains of thought rather than ensuring their correctness.\n\nIn conclusion, the verification/refinement and planning approaches offer different perspectives on chain of thought reasoning. The verification/refinement approach prioritizes the rigorous validation of reasoning steps and answers, ensuring their correctness and reliability.

Verification and refinement processes, as outlined in recent literature, involve rigorous deductive reasoning frameworks that enable the generation of \"Natural Programs\" which are amenable to verification through in-context learning [REF0]. These frameworks have been shown to enhance the rigor, trustworthiness, and interpretability of reasoning steps generated by large language models (LLMs) [REF0], [REF2]. The introduction of strategies such as Unanimity-Plurality Voting further refines the verification accuracy, although it is acknowledged that such methods do not completely eliminate the potential for LLMs to generate biased or incorrect content [REF2].\n\nOn the other hand, planning in the context of LLMs often involves the use of memory components, akin to human short-term and long-term memory, to inform decision-making processes [REF3]. This approach, known as Reflexion, leverages the history of interactions (short-term memory) and distilled important experiences (long-term memory) to guide the actions of LLMs [REF3]. Such a method is distinct from verification/refinement in that it is inherently forward-looking and generative, as opposed to the backward-looking and evaluative nature of verification.\n\nThe verification process can be further optimized by selectively including only the necessary context and premises, which has been shown to significantly improve reasoning chain verification accuracy [REF4]. This selective approach contrasts with the more exhaustive nature of planning, where a broader range of potential paths and outcomes may be considered [REF8].\n\nAdaptability and convenience are also key considerations in the verification/refinement process, as different problem properties, LLM capabilities, and resource constraints can be accommodated without the need for extra training [REF1]. This stands in contrast to planning approaches, which may require more complex setups and potentially more computational resources to explore a wider solution space [REF8].\n\nMoreover, the iterative nature of refinement processes, such as those described in the ITERATE model, allows for the continuous improvement of responses through feedback loops [REF7]. This is somewhat analogous to the iterative optimization process in planning, but with a focus on refining existing solutions rather than exploring new trajectories [REF3].\n\nIn summary, while both verification/refinement and planning are integral to the advancement of LLMs' reasoning capabilities, they serve different purposes and operate under different paradigms. Verification/refinement focuses on the accuracy and trustworthiness of each step in a reasoning chain [REF0], [REF2], [REF4], [REF9], whereas planning is concerned with the generation of actions based on a comprehensive understanding of past experiences and potential future outcomes [REF3], [REF8]. The intersection of these approaches presents an exciting direction for future work, as they could potentially complement each other to enhance the overall performance of LLMs in complex reasoning tasks [REF8], [REF9].", "references_sent_to_gpt": [{"title": "Deductive verification of chain-of-thought reasoning", "bibref": "BIBREF70", "authors": [{"first": "Zhan", "middle": [], "last": "Ling", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Yunhao", "middle": [], "last": "Fang", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Xuanlin", "middle": [], "last": "Li", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Zhiao", "middle": [], "last": "Huang", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Mingu", "middle": [], "last": "Lee", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Roland", "middle": [], "last": "Memisevic", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Hao", "middle": [], "last": "Su", "suffix": ""}], "chunk": "Deductive verification of chain-of-thought reasoning [SEP] Our key contributions are as follows:\n1.

This means they can fall short in\ntasks that require exploration, strategic lookahead, or where initial decisions play\na pivotal role. To surmount these challenges, we introduce a new framework for\nlanguage model inference, \u201cTree of Thoughts\u201d (ToT), which generalizes over the\npopular \u201cChain of Thought\u201d approach to prompting language models, and enables\nexploration over coherent units of text (\u201cthoughts\u201d) that serve as intermediate steps\ntoward problem solving. ToT allows LMs to perform deliberate decision making\nby considering multiple different reasoning paths and self-evaluating choices to\ndecide the next course of action, as well as looking ahead or backtracking when\nnecessary to make global choices. Our experiments show that ToT significantly\nenhances language models\u2019 problem-solving abilities on three novel tasks requiring\nnon-trivial planning or search: Game of 24, Creative Writing, and Mini Crosswords.\nFor instance, in Game of 24, while GPT-4 with chain-of-thought prompting only\nsolved 4% of tasks, our method achieved a success rate of 74%.

It is\nperhaps surprising that underlying all this progress is still the original autoregressive mechanism for\ngenerating text, which makes token-level decisions one by one and in a left-to-right fashion. Is such\na simple mechanism sufficient for a LM to be built toward a general problem solver? If not, what\nproblems would challenge the current paradigm, and what should be alternative mechanisms?\nThe literature on human cognition provides some clues to answer these questions. Research on \u201cdual\nprocess\u201d models suggests that people have two modes in which they engage with decisions \u2013 a fast,\nautomatic, unconscious mode (\u201cSystem 1\u201d) and a slow, deliberate, conscious mode (\u201cSystem 2\u201d)\n[27, 28, 13, 12]. These two modes have previously been connected to a variety of mathematical\nmodels used in machine learning. For example, research on reinforcement learning in humans and\nother animals has explored the circumstances under which they engage in associative \u201cmodel free\u201d\nlearning or more deliberative \u201cmodel based\u201d planning [6]. The simple associative token-level choices\nof LMs are also reminiscent of \u201cSystem 1\u201d, and thus might benefit from augmentation by a more\ndeliberate \u201cSystem 2\u201d planning process that (1) maintains and explores diverse alternatives for current\nPreprint.

See concrete examples of how thoughts are generated, evaluated, and\nsearched in Figures 2,4,6.\nchoices instead of just picking one, and (2) evaluates its current status and actively looks ahead or\nbacktracks to make more global decisions.\nTo design such a planning process, we return to the origins of artificial intelligence (and cognitive\nscience), drawing inspiration from the planning processes explored by Newell, Shaw, and Simon\nstarting in the 1950s [18, 19]. Newell and colleagues characterized problem solving [18] as search\nthrough a combinatorial problem space, represented as a tree. We thus propose the Tree of Thoughts\n(ToT) framework for general problem solving with language models. As Figure 1 illustrates, while\nexisting methods (detailed below) sample continuous language sequences for problem solving, ToT\nactively maintains a tree of thoughts, where each thought is a coherent language sequence that serves\nas an intermediate step toward problem solving (Table 1). Such a high-level semantic unit allows the\nLM to self-evaluate the progress different intermediate thoughts make towards solving the problem\nthrough a deliberate reasoning process that is also instantiated in language (Figures 2,4,6). This\nimplementation of search heuristics via LM self-evaluation and deliberation is novel, as previous\nsearch heuristics are either programmed or learned. Finally, we combine this language-based\ncapability to generate and evaluate diverse thoughts with search algorithms, such as breadth-first\nsearch (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS), which allow systematic exploration of the tree of thoughts\nwith lookahead and backtracking.\nEmpirically, we propose three new problems that challenge existing LM inference methods even with\nthe state-of-the-art language model, GPT-4 [20]: Game of 24, Creative Writing, and Crosswords\n(Table 1). These tasks require deductive, mathematical, commonsense, lexical reasoning abilities,\nand a way to incorporate systematic planning or search. We show ToT obtains superior results on\nall three tasks by being general and flexible enough to support different levels of thoughts, different\nways to generate and evaluate thoughts, and different search algorithms that adapt to the nature of\ndifferent problems. We also analyze how such choices affect model performances via systematic\nablations and discuss future directions to better train and use LMs.\n2\nBackground\nWe first formalize some existing methods that use large language models for problem-solving,\nwhich our approach is inspired by and later compared with. We use p\u03b8 to denote a pre-trained LM\nwith parameters \u03b8, and lowercase letters x, y, z, s, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 to denote a language sequence, i.e. x =\n(x[1], \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , x[n]) where each x[i] is a token, so that p\u03b8(x) = \ufffdn\ni=1 p\u03b8(x[i]|x[1...i]). We use uppercase\nletters S, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 to denote a collection of language sequences.\nInput-output (IO) prompting is the most common way to turn a problem input x into output y with\nLM: y \u223c p\u03b8(y|promptIO(x)), where promptIO(x) wraps input x with task instructions and/or fewshot input-output examples. For simplicity, let us denote pprompt\n\u03b8\n(output | input) = p\u03b8(output |\nprompt(input)), so that IO prompting can be formulated as y \u223c pIO\n\u03b8 (y|x).\n2\n\fChain-of-thought (CoT) prompting [35] was proposed to address cases where the mapping of\ninput x to output y is non-trivial (e.g. when x is a math question and y is the final numerical answer).\nThe key idea is to introduce a chain of thoughts z1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , zn to bridge x and y, where each zi is a\ncoherent language sequence that serves as a meaningful intermediate step toward problem solving\n(e.g. zi could be an intermediate equation for math QA). To solve problems with CoT, each thought\nzi \u223c pCoT\n\u03b8\n(zi | x, z1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7i\u22121) is sampled sequentially, then the output y \u223c pCoT\n\u03b8\n(y|x, z1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7n). In\npractice, [z1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7n, y] \u223c pCoT\n\u03b8\n(z1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7n, y|x) is sampled as a continuous language sequence, and the\ndecomposition of thoughts (e.g. is each zi a phrase, a sentence, or a paragraph) is left ambiguous.\nSelf-consistency with CoT (CoT-SC) [33] is an ensemble approach that samples k i.i.d. chains\nof thought: [z(i)\n1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7n, y(i)] \u223c pCoT\n\u03b8\n(z1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7n, y|x) (i = 1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 k), then returns the most frequent output:\narg maxy #{i | y(i) = y}. CoT-SC improves upon CoT, because there are generally different\nthought processes for the same problem (e.g. different ways to prove the same theorem), and the\noutput decision can be more faithful by exploring a richer set of thoughts. However, within each\nchain there is no local exploration of different thought steps, and the \u201cmost frequent\u201d heuristic only\napplies when the output space is limited (e.g. multi-choice QA).\n3\nTree of Thoughts: Deliberate Problem Solving with LM\nA genuine problem-solving process involves the repeated use of available information to initiate exploration, which discloses, in turn, more information until a way\nto attain the solution is finally discovered.\u2014\u2014 Newell et al. [18]\nResearch on human problem-solving suggests that people search through a combinatorial problemspace \u2013 a tree where the nodes represent partial solutions, and the branches correspond to operators\nthat modify them [18, 19]. Which branch to take is determined by heuristics that help to navigate the\nproblem-space and guide the problem-solver towards a solution. This perspective highlights two key\nshortcomings of existing approaches that use LMs to solve general problems: 1) Locally, they do not\nexplore different continuations within a thought process \u2013 the branches of the tree. 2) Globally, they\ndo not incorporate any type of planning, lookahead, or backtracking to help evaluate these different\noptions \u2013 the kind of heuristic-guided search that seems characteristic of human problem-solving.\nTo address these shortcomings, we introduce Tree of Thoughts (ToT), a paradigm that allows LMs to\nexplore multiple reasoning paths over thoughts (Figure 1(c)). ToT frames any problem as a search\nover a tree, where each node is a state s = [x, z1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7i] representing a partial solution with the input and\nthe sequence of thoughts so far. A specific instantiation of ToT involves answering four questions:\n1. How to decompose the intermediate process into thought steps; 2. How to generate potential\nthoughts from each state; 3. How to heuristically evaluate states; 4. What search algorithm to use.\n1. Thought decomposition. While CoT samples thoughts coherently without explicit decomposition,\nToT leverages problem properties to design and decompose intermediate thought steps. As Table 1\nshows, depending on different problems, a thought could be a couple of words (Crosswords), a line of\nequation (Game of 24), or a whole paragraph of writing plan (Creative Writing). In general, a thought\nshould be \u201csmall\u201d enough so that LMs can generate promising and diverse samples (e.g. generating\na whole book is usually too \u201cbig\u201d to be coherent), yet \u201cbig\u201d enough so that LMs can evaluate its\nprospect toward problem solving (e.g. generating one token is usually too \u201csmall\u201d to evaluate).\n2. Thought generator G(p\u03b8, s, k). Given a tree state s = [x, z1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7i], we consider two strategies to\ngenerate k candidates for the next thought step:\n(a) Sample i.i.d. thoughts from a CoT prompt (Creative Writing, Figure 4):\nz(j)\n\u223c\npCoT\n\u03b8\n(zi+1|s) = pCoT\n\u03b8\n(zi+1|x, z1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7i) (j = 1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 k). This works better when the thought\nspace is rich (e.g. each thought is a paragraph), and i.i.d. samples lead to diversity;\n(b) Propose thoughts sequentially using a \u201cpropose prompt\u201d (Game of 24, Figure 2; Crosswords,\nFigure 6): [z(1), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , z(k)] \u223c ppropose\n\u03b8\n(z(1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7k)\ni+1\n| s). This works better when the thought\nspace is more constrained (e.g. each thought is just a word or a line), so proposing different\nthoughts in the same context avoids duplication.\n3. State evaluator V (p\u03b8, S). Given a frontier of different states, the state evaluator evaluates the\nprogress they make towards solving the problem, serving as a heuristic for the search algorithm\nto determine which states to keep exploring and in which order. While heuristics are a standard\napproach to solving search problems, they are typically either programmed (e.g. DeepBlue [3]) or\n3\n\flearned (e.g. AlphaGo [26]). We propose a third alternative, by using the LM to deliberately reason\nabout states. When applicable, such a deliberate heuristic can be more flexible than programmed\nrules, and more sample-efficient than learned models. Similar to the thought generator, we consider\ntwo strategies to evaluate states either independently or together:\n(a) Value each state independently: V (p\u03b8, S)(s) \u223c pvalue\n\u03b8\n(v|s) \u2200s \u2208 S, where a value\nprompt reasons about the state s to generate a scalar value v (e.g. 1-10) or a classification (e.g. sure/likely/impossible) that could be heuristically turned into a value. The basis\nof such evaluative reasoning can vary across problems and thought steps. In this work, we\nexplore evaluation via few lookahead simulations (e.g. quickly confirm that 5, 5, 14 can\nreach 24 via 5 + 5 + 14, or \u201chot l\u201d can mean \u201cinn\u201d via filling \u201ce\u201d in \u201c \u201d) plus commonsense\n(e.g. 1 2 3 are too small to reach 24, or no word can start with \u201ctzxc\u201d). While the former\nmight promote \u201cgood\u201d states, the latter could help eliminate \u201cbad\u201d states.

When\nproblem success is harder to directly value (e.g. passage coherency), it is natural to to instead\ncompare different partial solutions and vote for the most promising one. This is similar\nin spirit to a \u201cstep-wise\u201d self-consistency strategy, i.e. cast \u201cwhich state to explore\u201d as a\nmulti-choice QA, and use LM samples to vote for it.\nFor both strategies, we could prompt the LM multiple times to aggregate the value or vote results to\ntrade time/resource/cost for more faithful/robust heuristics.\nAlgorithm 1 ToT-BFS(x, p\u03b8, G, k, V, T, b)\nRequire: Input x, LM p\u03b8, thought generator G()\n& size limit k, states evaluator V (), step limit T,\nbreadth limit b.\nS0 \u2190 {x}\nfor t = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , T do\nS\u2032\nt \u2190 {[s, z] | s \u2208 St\u22121, zt \u2208 G(p\u03b8, s, k)}\nVt \u2190 V (p\u03b8, S\u2032\nt)\nSt \u2190 arg maxS\u2282S\u2032\nt,|S|=b\n\ufffd\ns\u2208S Vt(s)\nend for\nreturn G(p\u03b8, arg maxs\u2208ST VT (s), 1)\nAlgorithm 2 ToT-DFS(s, t, p\u03b8, G, k, V, T, vth)\nRequire: Current state s, step t, LM p\u03b8, thought\ngenerator G() and size limit k, states evaluator\nV (), step limit T, threshold vth\nif t > T then record output G(p\u03b8, s, 1)\nend if\nfor s\u2032 \u2208 G(p\u03b8, s, k) do\n\u25b7 sorted candidates\nif V (p\u03b8, {s\u2032})(s) > vthres then \u25b7 pruning\nDFS(s\u2032, t + 1)\nend if\nend for\n4. Search algorithm. Finally, within the ToT framework, one can plug and play different search\nalgorithms depending on the tree structure. We explore two relatively simple search algorithms and\nleave more advanced ones (e.g. A* [9], MCTS [2]) for future work:\n(a) Breadth-first search (BFS) (Algorithm 1) maintains a set of the b most promising states\nper step. This is used for Game of 24 and Creative Writing where the tree depth is limit\n(T \u2264 3), and initial thought steps can be evaluated and pruned to a small set (b \u2264 5).\n(b) Depth-first search (DFS) (Algorithm 2) explores the most promising state first, until the\nfinal output is reached (t > T), or the state evaluator deems it impossible to solve the\nproblem from the current s (V (p\u03b8, {s})(s) \u2264 vth for a value threshold vth). In the latter\ncase, the subtree from s is pruned to trade exploration for exploitation. In both cases, DFS\nbacktracks to the parent state of s to continue exploration.\nConceptually, ToT has several benefits as a method for general problem-solving with LMs: (1) Generality. IO, CoT, CoT-SC, and self-refinement can be seen as special cases of ToT (i.e. trees of limited\ndepth and breadth; Figure 1). (2) Modularity. The base LM, as well as the thought decomposition,\ngeneration, evaluation, and search procedures can all be varied independently. (3) Adaptability.\nDifferent problem properties, LM capabilities, and resource constraints can be accommodated. (4)\nConvenience. No extra training is needed, just a pre-trained LM is sufficient. The next section will\nshow how these conceptual benefits translate to strong empirical performance in different problems.\n4\nExperiments\nWe propose three tasks that are hard even when sampling from the state-of-the-art language model,\nGPT-4 [20], using standard IO prompting or chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting.

2: ToT in a game of 24. The LM is prompted for (a) thought generation and (b) valuation.\nTask Setup. We scrape data from 4nums.com, which has 1,362 games that are sorted from easy to\nhard by human solving time, and use a subset of relatively hard games indexed 901-1,000 for testing.\nFor each task, we consider the output as success if it is a valid equation that equals 24 and uses the\ninput numbers each exactly once. We report the success rate across 100 games as the metric.\nBaselines. We use a standard input-output (IO) prompt with 5 in-context examples. For chain-ofthought (CoT) prompting, we augment each input-output pair with 3 intermediate equations, each\noperating on two remaining numbers. For example, given input \u201c4 9 10 13\u201d, the thoughts could be\n\u201c13 - 9 = 4 (left: 4 4 10); 10 - 4 = 6 (left: 4 6); 4 * 6 = 24 (left: 24)\u201d. For each game, we sample IO\nand CoT prompting for 100 times for average performance. We also consider a CoT self-consistency\nbaseline, which takes the majority output from 100 CoT samples, and an iterative-refine approach on\ntop of an IO sample for at most 10 iterations. At each iteration, the LM is conditioned on all previous\nhistory to \u201creflect on your mistakes and generate a refined answer\u201d if the output is incorrect. Note\nthat it uses groundtruth feedback signals about equation correctness.\nToT Setup. To frame Game of 24 into ToT, it is natural to decompose the thoughts into 3 steps,\neach an intermediate equation. As shown in Figure 2(a), at each tree node, we exact the \u201cleft\u201d\nnumbers and prompt the LM to propose some possible next steps. The same \u201cpropose prompt\u201d is\nused for all 3 thought steps, though it only has one example with 4 input numbers. We perform a\nbreadth-first search (BFS) in ToT, where at each step we keep the best b = 5 candidates. To perform\ndeliberate BFS in ToT, as shown in Figure 2(b), we prompt LM to evaluate each thought candidate as\n\u201csure/maybe/impossible\u201d with regard to reaching 24. The aim is to promote correct partial solutions\nthat can be verdicted within few lookahead trials, and eliminate impossible partial solutions based on\n\u201ctoo big/small\u201d commonsense, and keep the rest \u201cmaybe\u201d. We sample values 3 times for each thought.\n1Experiments were done between May 5-16, 2023.\n5\n\fMethod\nSuccess\nIO prompt\n7.3%\nCoT prompt\n4.0%\nCoT-SC (k=100)\n9.0%\nToT (ours) (b=1)\n45%\nToT (ours) (b=5)\n74%\nIO + Refine (k=10)\n27%\nIO (best of 100)\n33%\nCoT (best of 100)\n49%\nTable 2: Game of 24 Results.\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n(a) Success rate with nodes visited\nIO (best of k)\nCoT (best of k)\nToT (b=1...5)\n1\n2\n3\n4\nCorrect\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n(b) Samples failed at each step\nCoT\nToT (b=5)\nFigure 3: Game of 24 (a) scale analysis & (b) error analysis.\nResults. As shown in Table 2, IO, CoT, and CoT-SC prompting methods perform badly on the task,\nachieving only 7.3%, 4.0%, and 9.0% success rates. In contrast, ToT with a breadth of b = 1 already\nachieves a success rate of 45%, while b = 5 achieves 74%. We also consider an oracle setup for\nIO/CoT, by calculating the success rate using best of k samples (1 \u2264 k \u2264 100). To compare IO/CoT\n(best of k) with ToT, we consider calculating the tree nodes visited per task in ToT across b = 1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 5,\nand map the 5 success rates in Figure 3(a), treating IO/CoT (best of k) as visiting k nodes in a bandit.\nNot surprisingly, CoT scales better than IO, and best of 100 CoT samples achieve a success rate of\n49%, but still much worse than exploring more nodes in ToT (b > 1).\nError Analysis. Figure 3(b) breaks down at which step CoT and ToT samples fail the task, i.e. the\nthought (in CoT) or all b thoughts (in ToT) are invalid or impossible to reach 24. Notably, around\n60% of CoT samples already failed the task after generating the first step, or equivalently, the first\nthree words (e.g. \u201c4 + 9\u201d). This highlights the issues with direct left-to-right decoding.\n4.2\nCreative writing\nNext, we invent a creative writing task where the input is 4 random sentences and the output should\nbe a coherent passage with 4 paragraphs that end in the 4 input sentences respectively. Such a task is\nopen-ended and exploratory, and challenges creative thinking as well as high-level planning.\nTask setup. We sample random sentences from randomwordgenerator.com to form 100 inputs, and\nthere is no groundtruth passage for each input constraint. As we find that GPT-4 can follow the\ninput constraints most of the time, we focus on evaluating passage coherency in two ways: using a\nGPT-4 zero-shot prompt to provide a 1-10 scalar score, or using human judgments to compare pairs\nof outputs from different methods. For the former, we sample 5 scores and average them for each task\noutput, and we find these 5 scores usually consistent, with a standard deviation of around 0.56 on\naverage across outputs. For the latter, we employ a subset of the authors in a blind study to compare\nthe coherency of CoT vs. ToT generated passage pairs, where the order of passages is random flipped\nover 100 inputs.\nBaselines. Given the creative nature of the task, both IO and CoT prompts are zero-shot. While the\nformer prompts the LM to directly generate a coherent passage given input constraints, the latter\nprompts the LM to first make a brief plan then write the passage, i.e. the plan serves as the intermediate\nthought step. We generate 10 IO and CoT samples per task. We also consider an iterative-refine\n(k \u2264 5) method on top of a random IO sample for each task, where the LM is conditioned on input\nconstraints and the last generated passage to decide if the passage is already \u201cperfectly coherent\u201d,\nand if not generate a refined one.\nToT setup. We build a ToT with depth 2 (and only 1 intermediate thought step) \u2014 the LM first\ngenerates k = 5 plans and votes for the best one (Figure 4), then similarly generate k = 5 passages\nbased on the best plan then vote for the best one. Here the breadth limit b = 1, as only one choice is\nkept per step. A simple zero-shot vote prompt (\u201canalyze choices below, then conclude which is most\npromising for the instruction\u201d) is used to sample 5 votes at both steps.\nResults. Figure 5(a) shows average GPT-4 scores across 100 tasks, where ToT (7.56) is deemed to\ngenerate more coherent passages than IO (6.19) and CoT (6.93) on average.

As\nwe observe adjacent games contain similar clues, we use 20 games with indices 1, 6, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 91, 96 for\ntesting, and games 136, 141, 146, 151, 156 for prompting. For each task, the input describes the 5\nhorizontal clues and 5 vertical clues, and the output should be a board of 5 \u00d7 5 = 25 letters to solve\nthe crosswords. For evaluation, we consider three levels of success: the portion of correct letters (25\nper game), words (10 per game), and games.\nBaselines. We provide 5 example input-output pairs in the IO prompt, and in the CoT prompt\nadditionally include intermediate words in the order h1..5 then v1..5. We run each prompt for 10\nsamples and average the results.\nToT Setup. We leverage a depth-first search (Algorithm 2) that keeps exploring the most promising\nsubsequent word clue until the state is no longer promising, then backtrack to the parent state to\nexplore alternative thoughts. To make search tractable, subsequent thoughts are constrained not to\nchange any filled words or letters, so that the ToT has at most 10 intermediate steps. For thought\ngeneration, at each state we translate all existing thoughts (e.g. \u201ch2.motor; h1.tasks\u201d for the state\nin Figure 6(a)) into letter constraints for remaining clues (e.g. \u201cv1.To heap: tm\n;...\u201d) and prompt\na proposal prompt 5 times to come up with candidates for where and what to fill in the next word.\nImportantly, we also prompt the LM to give a confidence level for different thoughts, and aggregate\n7\n\f\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\nFigure 6: In Mini Crosswords, (a) how thoughts are proposed and aggregated in a priority queue\nfor depth-first search (DFS), and (b) how a state is evaluated based on the possibility of filling in\neach remaining word clue, and pruned if any remaining clue is deemed not possible to fill by the LM.\nThen DFS backtracks to the parent state and explore the next promising thought for clue.\nthese across proposals to obtain a sorted list of next thoughts to explore (Figure 6(a)). For state\nevaluations, we similarly translate each state into letter constraints for remaining clues, then evaluate\nfor each clue if it is possible to fill given the constraints. If any remaining clue is deemed \u201cimpossible\u201d\nto fill in (e.g. \u201cv1. To heap: tm s \u201d), then the exploration of the state\u2019s subtree is pruned and DFS\nbacktracks to its parent to explore the next promising thought. We limit DFS search steps to 100, and\nsimply render the deepest explored state (the first explored one if multiple) into the final output.\nResults. As shown in Table 3, IO and CoT prompting methods perform poorly with a word-level\nsuccess rate less than 16%, while ToT significantly improves all metrics, achieving a word-level\nsuccess rate of 60% and solving 4 out of 20 games. Such an improvement is not surprising, given IO\nand CoT lack mechanisms to try different clues, make changes to decisions, or backtrack.\nOracle and ablation studies. When outputting from the oracle best DFS state (instead of the\nheuristically determined best state) per task, ToT performance is even higher and actually solves\n7/20 games (Table 3, \u201c+best state\u201d), indicating our simple output heuristics can be readily improved.\nInterestingly, sometimes when the crosswords game is actually solved, the state evaluator might still\ndeem some words as \u201cimpossible\u201d and prune \u2014 possibly because 5 \u00d7 5 crosswords by design have\nsome rare or obselete words that GPT-4 cannot recognize2. Given the state evaluation as a pruning\nheuristic is imperfect, we also explore ablating the pruning, and find the performance generally worse\n(Table 3, \u201c-prune\u201d). However, it could actually find the correct solution for 4/20 games (though only\noutputting 1 via heuristic), 3 of which are games ToT+pruning cannot solve within 100 steps. Thus,\nbetter heuristics for DFS pruning are critical for problem solving in this case. Lastly, we confirm the\nimportance of backtracking by running an ablation that keeps filling the most promising clue for at\nmost 20 steps, allowing overwrites. This is similar to a \u201cgreedy\u201d BFS search with breadth limit of\nb = 1, and performs poorly with a word level success of only 20% (Table 3, \u201c-backtrack\u201d).\n5\nRelated Work\nPlanning and decision making. Smart planning and decision making are critical to achieving\npredefined goals. As they are trained on vast amount of world knowledge and human examples, LMs\nare known to have already absorbed rich commonsense that makes it possible to propose reasonable\nplans conditioned on problem setting and environmental states [10, 39, 34, 11, 32, 38, 37]. Our\nproposed Tree-of-Thought approach extends existing planning formulations by considering multiple\npotentially feasible plans simultaneously at each problem-solving step, and proceeding with the most\npromising ones. The integration between thought sampling and value feedback organically integrates\nplanning and decision-making mechanisms, enabling effective search inside a solution tree. On the\nother hand, traditional decision-making procedures usually require training dedicated reward and\npolicy models as in reinforcement learning (for example CHAI [30]), whereas we use the LM itself\nto provide the value estimates for decision making.\n2For example, \u201cagend\u201d is an obsolete form of \u201cagendum\u201d, but GPT-4 deems it a typo for \u201cagenda\u201d. External\nretrieval or web interaction could augment LM for problem solving under knowledge uncertainty.\n8\n\fSelf-reflection. Using LLMs to assess the viability of their own predictions is becoming an increasingly important procedure in problem solving. [25, 17, 21] introduced the \u201cself-reflection\u201d\nmechanism, in which LMs provide feedback to their generation candidates. [4] improves LMs code\ngeneration accuracy by injecting feedback messages generated by the LM itself based on its code\nexecution results. Similarly, [14] also introduces \u201ccritic\u201d or review steps over the actions and states,\ndeciding the next action to take in solving computer operation tasks. Another recent work very\nrelevant to ours is \u201cself-eval guided decoding\u201d [36]. Similar to our method, self-eval decoding\nalso follows a tree-search procedure with leaves sampled from stochastic beam search decoding,\nwhich are then evaluated by LLM itself with carefully prepared self-eval prompts. Their approach\nhowever, uses the PAL formulation [7] which represents thoughts as codes, which makes it difficult\nto tackle challenging tasks like creative writing which we consider in this paper. Our Tree-of-Thought\nformulation is thus more versatile and handles challenging tasks on which GPT-4 only achieves very\nlow accuracy with standard prompts.\nProgram-guided LLM generation. Our proposal is also related to recent advancements that organize LM\u2019s behavior with symbolic program guidance. For example [24] embeds LMs in an\nalgorithmic search procedure to help solve problems like question answering step-by-step, in which\nthe search trees are expanded by relevant paragraphs that might provide answers. This approach\nhowever differs from ours in that trees are expanded by sampling external paragraphs instead of the\nLM\u2019s own thoughts, and there is no reflection or voting steps. Another approach, LLM+P [15], goes\none step further and delegates the actual planning process to a classical planner.\nClassical search methods. Last but not least, our approach can be treated as a modern rendition\nof classical search methods for problem solving. For example it can be considered as a heuristic\nsearch algorithm like A* [8], in which the heuristic at each search node is provided by the LM\u2019s\nself-assessment. From this perspective, our method is also related to NeuroLogic A*esque decoding\nproposed in [16], which is inspired by A* search but introduces look-ahead heuristics that are\nefficient for LMs to improve the beam-search or top-k sampling decoding. This method however is\nconstrained to sentence generation tasks, whereas our framework are designed for complex, multi-step\nproblem solving guarded by value feedback.\n6\nDiscussion\nLimitations and future directions. Deliberate search such as ToT might not be necessary for\nmany existing tasks that GPT-4 already excels at, and as an initial step this work only explores\nthree relatively simple tasks that challenges GPT-4 and calls of better search and planning abilities\nincorporated with LMs. However, as we begin to deploy LMs for more real-world decision making\napplications (e.g. coding, data analysis, robotics, etc.), more complex tasks could emerge and present\nnew opportunities to study these research questions. Also, search methods like ToT requires more\nresources (e.g. GPT-4 API cost) than sampling methods in order to improve task performances,\nbut the modular flexibility of ToT allows users to customize such performance-cost tradeoffs, and\nongoing open-source efforts [29] should readily reduce such costs in the near future. Lastly, this work\nfocuses on using an off-the-shelf LM, and fine-tuning LMs using a ToT-style high-level counterfactual\ndecision making (e.g. deliberating over potential choices for the next paragraph, instead of predicting\nthe next token) might present opportunities to enhance the problem-solving capabilities of LMs.\nBroader impact. ToT is a framework that empowers LMs to more autonomously and intelligently\nmake decisions and solve problems. While current tasks are limited to reasoning and search problems,\nfuture applications involving interaction with external environments or humans could bring potential\ndanger, e.g. facilitating harmful uses of LMs. On the other hand, ToT also improves the interpretability\nof model decisions and the opportunity for human alignment, as the resulting representations are\nreadable, high-level language reasoning instead of implicit, low-level token values.\nConclusion. The associative \u201cSystem 1\u201d of LMs can be beneficially augmented by a \u201cSystem 2\u201d\nbased on searching a tree of possible paths to the solution to a problem. The Tree of Thoughts\nframework provides a way to translate classical insights about problem-solving into actionable\nmethods for contemporary LMs. At the same time, LMs address a weakness of these classical\nmethods, providing a way to solve complex problems that are not easily formalized, such as creative\nwriting. We see this intersection of LMs with classical approaches to AI as an exciting direction for\nfuture work.\n9\n\fReferences\n[1] T. Brown, B. Mann, N. Ryder, M. Subbiah, J. D. Kaplan, P. Dhariwal, A.

This means they can fall short in tasks that require exploration, strategic lookahead, or where initial decisions play a pivotal role. To surmount these challenges, we introduce a new framework for language model inference, \"Tree of Thoughts\" (ToT), which generalizes over the popular \"Chain of Thought\" approach to prompting language models, and enables exploration over coherent units of text (\"thoughts\") that serve as intermediate steps toward problem solving. ToT allows LMs to perform deliberate decision making by considering multiple different reasoning paths and self-evaluating choices to decide the next course of action, as well as looking ahead or backtracking when necessary to make global choices. Our experiments show that ToT significantly enhances language models' problem-solving abilities on three novel tasks requiring non-trivial planning or search: Game of 24, Creative Writing, and Mini Crosswords. For instance, in Game of 24, while GPT-4 with chain-of-thought prompting only solved 4% of tasks, our method achieved a success rate of 74%. Code repo with all prompts: [https://github.com/ysmyth/tree-of-thought-llm](https://github.com/ysmyth/tree-of-thought-llm).\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nOriginally designed to generate text, scaled-up versions of language models (LMs) such as GPT [22; 23; 1; 20] and PaLM [5] have been shown to be increasingly capable of performing an ever wider range of tasks requiring mathematical, symbolic, commonsense, and knowledge reasoning. It is perhaps surprising that underlying all this progress is still the original autoregressive mechanism for generating text, which makes token-level decisions one by one and in a left-to-right fashion. Is such a simple mechanism sufficient for a LM to be built toward a general problem solver? If not, what problems would challenge the current paradigm, and what should be alternative mechanisms?\n\nThe literature on human cognition provides some clues to answer these questions. Research on \"dual process\" models suggests that people have two modes in which they engage with decisions - a fast, automatic, unconscious mode (\"System 1\") and a slow, deliberate, conscious mode (\"System 2\") [27; 28; 13; 12]. These two modes have previously been connected to a variety of mathematical models used in machine learning. For example, research on reinforcement learning in humans and other animals has explored the circumstances under which they engage in associative \"model free\" learning or more deliberative \"model based\" planning [6]. The simple associative token-level choices of LMs are also reminiscent of \"System 1\", and thus might benefit from augmentation by a more deliberate \"System 2\" planning process that (1) maintains and explores diverse alternatives for currentchoices instead of just picking one, and (2) evaluates its current status and actively looks ahead or backtracks to make more global decisions.\n\nTo design such a planning process, we return to the origins of artificial intelligence (and cognitive science), drawing inspiration from the planning processes explored by Newell, Shaw, and Simon starting in the 1950s [18; 19]. Newell and colleagues characterized problem solving [18] as search through a combinatorial problem space, represented as a tree. We thus propose the Tree of Thoughts (ToT) framework for general problem solving with language models. As Figure 1 illustrates, while existing methods (detailed below) sample continuous language sequences for problem solving, ToT actively maintains a tree of thoughts, where each _thought_ is a coherent language sequence that serves as an intermediate step toward problem solving (Table 1). Such a high-level semantic unit allows the LM to self-evaluate the progress different intermediate thoughts make towards solving the problem through a deliberate reasoning process that is also instantiated in language (Figures 2,4,6). This implementation of search heuristics via LM self-evaluation and deliberation is novel, as previous search heuristics are either programmed or learned. Finally, we combine this language-based capability to generate and evaluate diverse thoughts with search algorithms, such as breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS), which allow systematic exploration of the tree of thoughts with lookahead and backtracking.\n\nEmpirically, we propose three new problems that challenge existing LM inference methods even with the state-of-the-art language model, GPT-4 [20]: Game of 24, Creative Writing, and Crosswords (Table 1). These tasks require deductive, mathematical, commonsense, lexical reasoning abilities, and a way to incorporate systematic planning or search. We show ToT obtains superior results on all three tasks by being general and flexible enough to support different levels of thoughts, different ways to generate and evaluate thoughts, and different search algorithms that adapt to the nature of different problems. We also analyze how such choices affect model performances via systematic ablations and discuss future directions to better train and use LMs.\n\n## 2 Background\n\nWe first formalize some existing methods that use large language models for problem-solving, which our approach is inspired by and later compared with. We use \\(p_{\\theta}\\) to denote a pre-trained LM with parameters \\(\\theta\\), and **lowercase letters \\(x,y,z,s,\\cdots\\) to denote a language sequence**, i.e. \\(x=(x[1],\\cdots,x[n])\\) where each \\(x[i]\\) is a token, so that \\(p_{\\theta}(x)=\\prod_{i=1}^{n}p_{\\theta}(x[i]|x[1...i])\\). We use uppercase letters \\(S,\\cdots\\) to denote a collection of language sequences.\n\n**Input-output (IO) prompting** is the most common way to turn a problem input \\(x\\) into output \\(y\\) with LM: \\(y\\sim p_{\\theta}(y|\\texttt{prompt}_{IO}(x))\\), where \\(\\texttt{prompt}_{IO}(x)\\) wraps input \\(x\\) with task instructions and/or few-shot input-output examples. For simplicity, let us denote \\(p_{\\theta}^{\\text{prompt}}(\\texttt{output}\\mid\\texttt{input})=p_{\\theta}( \\texttt{output}\\mid\\texttt{prompt}(\\texttt{input}))\\), so that IO prompting can be formulated as \\(y\\sim p_{\\theta}^{IO}(y|x)\\).\n\nFigure 1: Schematic illustrating various approaches to problem solving with LLMs. Each rectangle box represents a _thought_, which is a coherent language sequence that serves as an intermediate step toward problem solving. See concrete examples of how thoughts are generated, evaluated, and searched in Figures 2,4,6.\n\n**Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting**[35] was proposed to address cases where the mapping of input \\(x\\) to output \\(y\\) is non-trivial (e.g. when \\(x\\) is a math question and \\(y\\) is the final numerical answer). The key idea is to introduce a chain of _thoughts_\\(z_{1},\\cdots,z_{n}\\) to bridge \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), where each \\(z_{i}\\) is a coherent language sequence that serves as a meaningful intermediate step toward problem solving (e.g. \\(z_{i}\\) could be an intermediate equation for math QA). To solve problems with CoT, each thought \\(z_{i}\\sim p_{\\theta}^{CoT}(z_{i}\\mid x,z_{1\\dots i-1})\\) is sampled sequentially, then the output \\(y\\sim p_{\\theta}^{CoT}(y|x,z_{1\\dots n})\\). In practice, \\([z_{1\\dots n},y]\\sim p_{\\theta}^{CoT}(z_{1\\dots n},y|x)\\) is sampled as a continuous language sequence, and the **decomposition** of thoughts (e.g. is each \\(z_{i}\\) a phrase, a sentence, or a paragraph) is left ambiguous.\n\n**Self-consistency with CoT (CoT-SC)**[33] is an ensemble approach that samples \\(k\\) i.i.d. chains of thought: \\([z_{1\\dots n}^{(i)},y^{(i)}]\\sim p_{\\theta}^{CoT}(z_{1\\dots n},y|x)\\) (\\(i=1\\cdots k\\)), then returns the most frequent output: \\(\\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{y}\\#\\{i\\mid y^{(i)}=y\\}\\). CoT-SC improves upon CoT, because there are generally different thought processes for the same problem (e.g. different ways to prove the same theorem), and the output decision can be more faithful by exploring a richer set of thoughts. However, within each chain there is no local exploration of different thought steps, and the \"most frequent\" heuristic only applies when the output space is limited (e.g. multi-choice QA).\n\n## 3 Tree of Thoughts: Deliberate Problem Solving with LM\n\n_A genuine problem-solving process involves the repeated use of available information to initiate exploration, which discloses, in turn, more information until a way to attain the solution is finally discovered._----_Newell et al._[18]\n\nResearch on human problem-solving suggests that people search through a combinatorial problem-space - a tree where the nodes represent partial solutions, and the branches correspond to operators that modify them [18, 19]. Which branch to take is determined by heuristics that help to navigate the problem-space and guide the problem-solver towards a solution. This perspective highlights two key shortcomings of existing approaches that use LMs to solve general problems: 1) Locally, they do not explore _different_ continuations within a thought process - the branches of the tree. 2) Globally, they do not incorporate any type of planning, lookahead, or backtracking to help evaluate these different options - the kind of heuristic-guided search that seems characteristic of human problem-solving.\n\nTo address these shortcomings, we introduce _Tree of Thoughts (ToT)_, a paradigm that allows LMs to explore multiple reasoning paths over thoughts (Figure 1(c)). ToT frames any problem as a search over a tree, where each node is a **state**\\(s=[x,z_{1\\dots i}]\\) representing a partial solution with the input and the sequence of thoughts so far. A specific instantiation of ToT involves answering four questions: 1. How to **decompose** the intermediate process into thought steps; 2. How to **generate** potential thoughts from each state; 3. How to heuristically **evaluate** states; 4. What **search** algorithm to use.\n\n**1. Thought decomposition.** While CoT samples thoughts coherently without explicit decomposition, ToT leverages problem properties to design and decompose intermediate thought steps. As Table 1 shows, depending on different problems, a thought could be a couple of words (Crosswords), a line of equation (Game of 24), or a whole paragraph of writing plan (Creative Writing). In general, a thought should be \"small\" enough so that LMs can generate promising and diverse samples (e.g. generating a whole book is usually too \"big\" to be coherent), yet \"big\" enough so that LMs can evaluate its prospect toward problem solving (e.g. generating one token is usually too \"small\" to evaluate).\n\n**2. Thought generator \\(G(p_{\\theta},s,k)\\).** Given a tree state \\(s=[x,z_{1\\dots i}]\\), we consider two strategies to generate \\(k\\) candidates for the next thought step:\n\n1. **Sample** i.i.d. thoughts from a CoT prompt (Creative Writing, Figure 4): \\(z^{(j)}\\sim p_{\\theta}^{CoT}(z_{i+1}|s)=p_{\\theta}^{CoT}(z_{i+1}|x,z_{1\\dots i} )\\) (\\(j=1\\cdots k\\)). This works better when the thought space is rich (e.g. each thought is a paragraph), and i.i.d. samples lead to diversity;\n2. **Propose** thoughts sequentially using a \"propose prompt\" (Game of 24, Figure 2; Crosswords, Figure 6): \\([z^{(1)},\\cdots,z^{(k)}]\\sim p_{\\theta}^{propose}(z_{i+1}^{(1\\dots k)}\\mid s)\\). This works better when the thought space is more constrained (e.g. each thought is just a word or a line), so proposing different thoughts in the same context avoids duplication.\n\n**3. State evaluator \\(V(p_{\\theta},S)\\).** Given a frontier of different states, the state evaluator evaluates the progress they make towards solving the problem, serving as a _heuristic_ for the search algorithm to determine which states to keep exploring and in which order. While heuristics are a standard approach to solving search problems, they are typically either programmed (e.g. DeepBlue [3]) orlearned (e.g. AlphaGo [26]). We propose a third alternative, by using the LM to deliberately reason about states. When applicable, such a deliberate heuristic can be more flexible than programmed rules, and more sample-efficient than learned models. Similar to the thought generator, we consider two strategies to evaluate states either independently or together:\n\n1. **Value** each state independently: \\(V(p_{\\theta},S)(s)\\sim p_{\\theta}^{value}(v|s)\\ \\forall s\\in S\\), where a value prompt reasons about the state \\(s\\) to generate a scalar value \\(v\\) (e.g. 1-10) or a classification (e.g. sure/likely/impossible) that could be heuristically turned into a value. The basis of such evaluative reasoning can vary across problems and thought steps. In this work, we explore evaluation via few _lookahead_ simulations (e.g. quickly confirm that 5, 5, 14 can reach 24 via 5 + 5 + 14, or \"hot_l\" can mean \"inn\" via filling \"e\" in \"_\"_\") plus commonsense (e.g. 1 2 3 are too small to reach 24, or no word can start with \"tzxc\"). While the former might promote \"good\" states, the latter could help eliminate \"bad\" states. Such valuations do not need to be perfect, and only need to be approximately\n2. **Vote** across states: \\(V(p_{\\theta},S)(s)=\\mathds{1}[s=s^{*}]\\), where a \"good\" state \\(s^{*}\\sim p_{\\theta}^{vote}(s^{*}|S)\\) is voted out based on deliberately comparing different states in \\(S\\) in a vote prompt. When problem success is harder to directly value (e.g. passage coherency), it is natural to to instead compare different partial solutions and vote for the most promising one. This is similar in spirit to a \"step-wise\" self-consistency strategy, i.e. cast \"which state to explore\" as a multi-choice QA, and use LM samples to vote for it.\n\nFor both strategies, we could prompt the LM multiple times to aggregate the value or vote results to trade time/resource/cost for more faithful/robust heuristics.\n\n```\nInput \\(x\\), LM \\(p_{\\theta}\\), thought generator \\(G()\\) & size limit \\(k\\), states evaluator \\(V()\\), step limit \\(T\\), breadth limit \\(b\\). \\(S_{0}\\leftarrow\\{x\\}\\) for\\(t=1,\\cdots,T\\)do \\(S^{\\prime}_{t}\\leftarrow\\{[s,z]\\ |\\ s\\in S_{t-1},z_{t}\\in\\mathrm{G}(p_{ \\theta},s,k)\\}\\) \\(V_{t}\\gets V(p_{\\theta},S^{\\prime}_{t})\\) \\(S_{t}\\leftarrow\\arg\\max_{S\\subset S^{\\prime}_{t},|S|=b}\\sum_{s\\in S}V_{t}(s)\\) endfor return\\(G(p_{\\theta},\\arg\\max_{s\\in S_{T}}V_{T}(s),1)\\)\n```\n\n**Algorithm 1** ToT-BFS(\\(x,p_{\\theta},G,k,V,T,b\\))\n\n## 4 Search algorithm.\n\nFinally, within the ToT framework, one can plug and play different search algorithms depending on the tree structure. We explore two relatively simple search algorithms and leave more advanced ones (e.g. A* [9], MCTS [2]) for future work:\n\n1. **Breadth-first search (BFS)** (Algorithm 1) maintains a set of the \\(b\\) most promising states per step. This is used for Game of 24 and Creative Writing where the tree depth is limit (\\(T\\leq 3\\)), and initial thought steps can be evaluated and pruned to a small set (\\(b\\leq 5\\)).\n2. **Depth-first search (DFS)** (Algorithm 2) explores the most promising state first, until the final output is reached (\\(t>T\\)), or the state evaluator deems it impossible to solve the problem from the current \\(s\\) (\\(V(p_{\\theta},\\{s\\})(s)\\leq v_{th}\\) for a value threshold \\(v_{th}\\)). In the latter case, the subtree from \\(s\\) is pruned to trade exploration for exploitation. In both cases, DFS _backtracks_ to the parent state of \\(s\\) to continue exploration.\n\nConceptually, ToT has several benefits as a method for general problem-solving with LMs: (1) _Generality_. IO, CoT, CoT-SC, and self-refinement can be seen as special cases of ToT (i.e. trees of limited depth and breadth; Figure 1). (2) _Modularity_. The base LM, as well as the thought decomposition, generation, evaluation, and search procedures can all be varied independently. (3) _Adaptability_. Different problem properties, LM capabilities, and resource constraints can be accommodated. (4) _Convenience_. No extra training is needed, just a pre-trained LM is sufficient. The next section will show how these conceptual benefits translate to strong empirical performance in different problems.\n\n## 4 Experiments\n\nWe propose three tasks that are hard even when sampling from the state-of-the-art language model, GPT-4 [20], using standard IO prompting or chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. We show how deliberate search in trees of thoughts (ToT) produces better results, and more importantly, interesting and promising new ways to use language models to solve problems requiring search or planning. Unless otherwise stated, we perform experiments using a Chat Completion mode GPT-41 with a sampling temperature of 0.7.\n\nFootnote 1: Experiments were done between May 5-16, 2023.\n\n### Game of 24\n\nGame of 24 is a mathematical reasoning challenge, where the goal is to use 4 numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+-*/) to obtain 24. For example, given input \"4 9 10 13\", a solution output could be \"(10 - 4) * (13 - 9) = 24\".\n\n**Task Setup.** We scrape data from 4nums.com, which has 1,362 games that are sorted from easy to hard by human solving time, and use a subset of relatively hard games indexed 901-1,000 for testing. For each task, we consider the output as success if it is a valid equation that equals 24 and uses the input numbers each exactly once. We report the success rate across 100 games as the metric.\n\n**Baselines.** We use a standard input-output (IO) prompt with 5 in-context examples. For chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, we augment each input-output pair with 3 intermediate equations, each operating on two remaining numbers. For example, given input \"4 9 10 13\", the thoughts could be \"13 - 9 = 4 (left: 4 4 10); 10 - 4 = 6 (left: 4 6); 4 * 6 = 24 (left: 24)\". For each game, we sample IO and CoT prompting for 100 times for average performance. We also consider a CoT self-consistency baseline, which takes the majority output from 100 CoT samples, and an iterative-refine approach on top of an IO sample for at most \\(10\\) iterations. At each iteration, the LM is conditioned on all previous history to \"reflect on your mistakes and generate a refined answer\" if the output is incorrect. Note that it uses groundtruth feedback signals about equation correctness.\n\n**ToT Setup.** To frame Game of 24 into ToT, it is natural to decompose the thoughts into 3 steps, each an intermediate equation. As shown in Figure 2(a), at each tree node, we exact the \"left\" numbers and prompt the LM to propose some possible next steps. The same \"propose prompt\" is used for all 3 thought steps, though it only has one example with 4 input numbers. We perform a breadth-first search (BFS) in ToT, where at each step we keep the best \\(b=5\\) candidates. To perform deliberate BFS in ToT, as shown in Figure 2(b), we prompt LM to evaluate each thought candidate as \"sure/maybe/impossible\" with regard to reaching 24. The aim is to promote correct partial solutions that can be verdicted within few lookahead trials, and eliminate impossible partial solutions based on \"too big/small\" commonsense, and keep the rest \"maybe\". We sample values \\(3\\) times for each thought.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l|l l l} \\hline \\hline  & **Game of 24** & **Creative Writing** & **5x5 Crosswords** \\\\ \\hline\n**Input** & 4 numbers (4 9 10 13) & 4 random sentences & 10 clues (h1.presented;..) \\\\ \\hline\n**Output** & An equation to reach 24 (13-9)*(10-4)=24 & A passage of 4 paragraphs ending in the 4 sentences & 5x5 letters: SHOWN; WIRRA; AVAIL;... \\\\ \\hline\n**Thoughts** & 3 intermediate equations (13-9=4 (left 4,4,10); 10-4=6 (left 4,6); 4*6=24) & A short writing plan (1.

Input, output, thought examples are in blue.\n\nFigure 2: ToT in a game of 24. The LM is prompted for (a) thought generation and (b) valuation.\n\n**Results.** As shown in Table 2, IO, CoT, and CoT-SC prompting methods perform badly on the task, achieving only 7.3%, 4.0%, and 9.0% success rates. In contrast, ToT with a breadth of \\(b=1\\) already achieves a success rate of \\(45\\%\\), while \\(b=5\\) achieves \\(74\\%\\). We also consider an oracle setup for IO/CoT, by calculating the success rate using best of \\(k\\) samples (\\(1\\leq k\\leq 100\\)). To compare IO/CoT (best of k) with ToT, we consider calculating the tree nodes visited per task in ToT across \\(b=1\\cdots 5\\), and map the 5 success rates in Figure 3(a), treating IO/CoT (best of \\(k\\)) as visiting \\(k\\) nodes in a bandit. Not surprisingly, CoT scales better than IO, and best of 100 CoT samples achieve a success rate of \\(49\\%\\), but still much worse than exploring more nodes in ToT (\\(b>1\\)).\n\n**Error Analysis.** Figure 3(b) breaks down at which step CoT and ToT samples fail the task, i.e. the thought (in CoT) or all \\(b\\) thoughts (in ToT) are invalid or impossible to reach 24. Notably, around 60% of CoT samples already failed the task after generating the first step, or equivalently, the first three words (e.g. \"\\(4+9\\)\"). This highlights the issues with direct left-to-right decoding.\n\n### Creative writing\n\nNext, we invent a creative writing task where the input is 4 random sentences and the output should be a coherent passage with 4 paragraphs that end in the 4 input sentences respectively. Such a task is open-ended and exploratory, and challenges creative thinking as well as high-level planning.\n\n**Task setup.** We sample random sentences from randomwordgenerator.com to form 100 inputs, and there is no groundtruth passage for each input constraint. As we find that GPT-4 can follow the input constraints most of the time, we focus on evaluating passage coherency in two ways: using a GPT-4 zero-shot prompt to provide a 1-10 scalar score, or using human judgments to compare pairs of outputs from different methods. For the former, we sample 5 scores and average them for each task output, and we find these 5 scores usually consistent, with a standard deviation of around \\(0.56\\) on average across outputs. For the latter, we employ a subset of the authors in a blind study to compare the coherency of CoT vs. ToT generated passage pairs, where the order of passages is random flipped over 100 inputs.\n\n**Baselines.** Given the creative nature of the task, both IO and CoT prompts are zero-shot. While the former prompts the LM to directly generate a coherent passage given input constraints, the latter prompts the LM to first make a brief plan then write the passage, i.e. the plan serves as the intermediate thought step. We generate 10 IO and CoT samples per task. We also consider an iterative-refine (\\(k\\leq 5\\)) method on top of a random IO sample for each task, where the LM is conditioned on input constraints and the last generated passage to decide if the passage is already \"perfectly coherent\", and if not generate a refined one.\n\n**ToT setup.** We build a ToT with depth 2 (and only 1 intermediate thought step) -- the LM first generates \\(k=5\\) plans and votes for the best one (Figure 4), then similarly generate \\(k=5\\) passages based on the best plan then vote for the best one. Here the breadth limit \\(b=1\\), as only one choice is kept per step. A simple zero-shot vote prompt (\"analyze choices below, then conclude which is most promising for the instruction\") is used to sample 5 votes at both steps.\n\n**Results.** Figure 5(a) shows average GPT-4 scores across 100 tasks, where ToT (7.56) is deemed to generate more coherent passages than IO (6.19) and CoT (6.93) on average. While such an automatic metric might be noisy, Figure 5(b) confirms the finding by showing that humans prefer ToT over CoT in 41 out of 100 passage pairs, while only prefer CoT over ToT in 21 (other 38 pairs are found \"similarly coherent\"). Lastly, iterative-refine is more effective on this natural language task, where\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c} \\hline \\hline\n**Method** & **Success** \\\\ \\hline IO prompt & 7.3\\% \\\\ CoT prompt & 4.0\\% \\\\ CoT-SC (k=100) & 9.0\\% \\\\ ToT (ours) (b=1) & 45\\% \\\\ ToT (ours) (b=5) & **74\\%** \\\\ \\hline IO + Refine (k=10) & 27\\% \\\\ IO (best of 100) & 33\\% \\\\ CoT (best of 100) & 49\\% \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 2: Game of 24 Results. Figure 3: Game of 24 (a) scale analysis & (b) error analysis.\n\nit improves IO coherency score from 6.19 to 7.67, and ToT coherency score from 7.56 to 7.91. We believe it could be thought of as a third approach to thought generation in the ToT framework, where new thoughts can arise from refining old thoughts instead of i.i.d. or sequentially generated.\n\n### Mini Crosswords\n\nIn Game of 24 and Creative Writing, ToT is relatively shallow -- at most 3 thought steps are needed to reach the final output. Here we explore \\(5\\times 5\\) mini crosswords as a harder search problem involving natural language. Again, the goal is not just to solve the task, as more general crosswords can be readily solved with specialized NLP pipelines [31] that leverages large-scale retrieval instead of LM. Rather, we aim to explore the limit of LM as a general problem solver that explores its own thoughts and guides its own exploration with deliberate reasoning as heuristics.\n\n**Task Setup.** We scrape data from GooBix, which contains 156 games of \\(5\\times 5\\) mini crosswords. As we observe adjacent games contain similar clues, we use 20 games with indices \\(1,6,\\cdots,91,96\\) for testing, and games \\(136,141,146,151,156\\) for prompting. For each task, the input describes the 5 horizontal clues and 5 vertical clues, and the output should be a board of \\(5\\times 5=25\\) letters to solve the crosswords. For evaluation, we consider three levels of success: the portion of correct letters (25 per game), words (10 per game), and games.\n\n**Baselines.** We provide 5 example input-output pairs in the IO prompt, and in the CoT prompt additionally include intermediate words in the order h1..5 then v1..5. We run each prompt for 10 samples and average the results.\n\n**ToT Setup.** We leverage a depth-first search (Algorithm 2) that keeps exploring the most promising subsequent word clue until the state is no longer promising, then backtrack to the parent state to explore alternative thoughts. To make search tractable, subsequent thoughts are constrained not to change any filled words or letters, so that the ToT has at most 10 intermediate steps. For thought generation, at each state we translate all existing thoughts (e.g. \"h2.motor; h1.tasks\" for the state in Figure 6(a)) into letter constraints for remaining clues (e.g. \"v1.To heap: tm_,...\") and prompt a proposal prompt \\(5\\) times to come up with candidates for where and what to fill in the next word. Importantly, we also prompt the LM to give a confidence level for different thoughts, and aggregate\n\nFigure 4: A step of deliberate search in a randomly picked Creative Writing task. Given the input, the LM samples 5 different plans, then votes 5 times to decide which plan is best. The majority choice is used to consequently write the output passage with the same sample-vote procedure.\n\nFigure 5: Creative Writing results.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l|l l l} \\hline \\hline\n**Method** & \\multicolumn{3}{l}{**Success Rate (\\%)**} \\\\  & \\multicolumn{1}{l}{**Letter Word**} & \\multicolumn{1}{l}{**Game**} \\\\ \\hline IO & 38.7 & 14 & 0 \\\\ CoT & 40.6 & 15.6 & 1 \\\\ ToT (ours) & **78** & **60** & **20** \\\\ \\hline +best state & 82.4 & 67.5 & 35 \\\\ -prune & 65.4 & 41.5 & 5 \\\\ -backtrack & 54.6 & 20 & 5 \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 3: Mini Crosswords results.\n\nthese across proposals to obtain a sorted list of next thoughts to explore (Figure 6(a)). For state evaluations, we similarly translate each state into letter constraints for remaining clues, then evaluate for each clue if it is possible to fill given the constraints. If any remaining clue is deemed \"impossible\" to fill in (e.g. \"v1. To heap: tm_s_\"), then the exploration of the state's subtree is pruned and DFS backtracks to its parent to explore the next promising thought. We limit DFS search steps to 100, and simply render the deepest explored state (the first explored one if multiple) into the final output.\n\n**Results.** As shown in Table 3, IO and CoT prompting methods perform poorly with a word-level success rate less than \\(16\\%\\), while ToT significantly improves all metrics, achieving a word-level success rate of \\(60\\%\\) and solving 4 out of 20 games. Such an improvement is not surprising, given IO and CoT lack mechanisms to try different clues, make changes to decisions, or backtrack.\n\n**Oracle and ablation studies.** When outputting from the oracle best DFS state (instead of the heuristically determined best state) per task, ToT performance is even higher and actually solves 7/20 games (Table 3, \"+best state\"), indicating our simple output heuristics can be readily improved. Interestingly, sometimes when the crosswords game is actually solved, the state evaluator might still deem some words as \"impossible\" and prune -- possibly because \\(5\\times 5\\) crosswords by design have some rare or obsolete words that GPT-4 cannot recognize2. Given the state evaluation as a pruning heuristic is imperfect, we also explore ablating the pruning, and find the performance generally worse (Table 3, \"-prune\"). However, it could actually find the correct solution for 4/20 games (though only outputting 1 via heuristic), 3 of which are games ToT+pruning cannot solve within 100 steps. Thus, better heuristics for DFS pruning are critical for problem solving in this case. Lastly, we confirm the importance of backtracking by running an ablation that keeps filling the most promising clue for at most 20 steps, allowing overwrites. This is similar to a \"greedy\" BFS search with breadth limit of \\(b=1\\), and performs poorly with a word level success of only \\(20\\%\\) (Table 3, \"-backtrack\").\n\nFootnote 2: For example, \u201cagent\u201d is an obsolete form of \u201cagendum\u201d, but GPT-4 deems it a typo for \u201cagenda\u201d. External retrieval or web interaction could augment LM for problem solving under knowledge uncertainty.\n\n## 5 Related Work\n\n**Planning and decision making.** Smart planning and decision making are critical to achieving predefined goals. As they are trained on vast amount of world knowledge and human examples, LMs are known to have already absorbed rich commonsense that makes it possible to propose reasonable plans conditioned on problem setting and environmental states [10; 39; 34; 11; 32; 38; 37]. Our proposed Tree-of-Thought approach extends existing planning formulations by considering multiple potentially feasible plans simultaneously at each problem-solving step, and proceeding with the most promising ones. The integration between thought sampling and value feedback organically integrates planning and decision-making mechanisms, enabling effective search inside a solution tree. On the other hand, traditional decision-making procedures usually require training dedicated reward and policy models as in reinforcement learning (for example CHAI [30]), whereas we use the LM itself to provide the value estimates for decision making.\n\nFigure 6: In Mini Crosswords, (a) how thoughts are proposed and aggregated in a priority queue for depth-first search (DFS), and (b) how a state is evaluated based on the possibility of filling in each remaining word clue, and pruned if any remaining clue is deemed not possible to fill by the LM. Then DFS backtracks to the parent state and explore the next promising thought for clue.\n\n**Self-reflection.** Using LLMs to assess the viability of their own predictions is becoming an increasingly important procedure in problem solving. [25; 17; 21] introduced the \"self-reflection\" mechanism, in which LMs provide feedback to their generation candidates. [4] improves LMs code generation accuracy by injecting feedback messages generated by the LM itself based on its code execution results. Similarly, [14] also introduces \"critic\" or review steps over the actions and states, deciding the next action to take in solving computer operation tasks. Another recent work very relevant to ours is \"self-eval guided decoding\" [36]. Similar to our method, self-eval decoding also follows a tree-search procedure with leaves sampled from stochastic beam search decoding, which are then evaluated by LLM itself with carefully prepared self-eval prompts. Their approach however, uses the PAL formulation [7] which represents thoughts as codes, which makes it difficult to tackle challenging tasks like creative writing which we consider in this paper. Our Tree-of-Thought formulation is thus more versatile and handles challenging tasks on which GPT-4 only achieves very low accuracy with standard prompts.\n\n**Program-guided LLM generation.** Our proposal is also related to recent advancements that organize LM's behavior with symbolic program guidance. For example [24] embeds LMs in an algorithmic search procedure to help solve problems like question answering step-by-step, in which the search trees are expanded by relevant paragraphs that might provide answers. This approach however differs from ours in that trees are expanded by sampling external paragraphs instead of the LM's own thoughts, and there is no reflection or voting steps. Another approach, LLM+P [15], goes one step further and delegates the actual planning process to a classical planner.\n\n**Classical search methods.** Last but not least, our approach can be treated as a modern rendition of classical search methods for problem solving. For example it can be considered as a heuristic search algorithm like A* [8], in which the heuristic at each search node is provided by the LM's self-assessment. From this perspective, our method is also related to NeuroLogic A*esque decoding proposed in [16], which is inspired by A* search but introduces look-ahead heuristics that are efficient for LMs to improve the beam-search or top-k sampling decoding. This method however is constrained to sentence generation tasks, whereas our framework are designed for complex, multi-step problem solving guarded by value feedback.\n\n## 6 Discussion\n\n**Limitations and future directions.** Deliberate search such as ToT might not be necessary for many existing tasks that GPT-4 already excels at, and as an initial step this work only explores three relatively simple tasks that challenges GPT-4 and calls of better search and planning abilities incorporated with LMs. However, as we begin to deploy LMs for more real-world decision making applications (e.g. coding, data analysis, robotics, etc.), more complex tasks could emerge and present new opportunities to study these research questions. Also, search methods like ToT requires more resources (e.g. GPT-4 API cost) than sampling methods in order to improve task performances, but the modular flexibility of ToT allows users to customize such performance-cost tradeoffs, and ongoing open-source efforts [29] should readily reduce such costs in the near future. Lastly, this work focuses on using an off-the-shelf LM, and fine-tuning LMs using a ToT-style high-level counterfactual decision making (e.g. deliberating over potential choices for the next paragraph, instead of predicting the next token) might present opportunities to enhance the problem-solving capabilities of LMs.\n\n**Broader impact.** ToT is a framework that empowers LMs to more autonomously and intelligently make decisions and solve problems. While current tasks are limited to reasoning and search problems, future applications involving interaction with external environments or humans could bring potential danger, e.g. facilitating harmful uses of LMs. On the other hand, ToT also improves the interpretability of model decisions and the opportunity for human alignment, as the resulting representations are readable, high-level language reasoning instead of implicit, low-level token values.\n\n**Conclusion.** The associative \"System 1\" of LMs can be beneficially augmented by a \"System 2\" based on searching a tree of possible paths to the solution to a problem. The Tree of Thoughts framework provides a way to translate classical insights about problem-solving into actionable methods for contemporary LMs. At the same time, LMs address a weakness of these classical methods, providing a way to solve complex problems that are not easily formalized, such as creative writing. We see this intersection of LMs with classical approaches to AI as an exciting direction for future work.\n\n## References\n\n* [1] T. Brown, B. Mann, N. Ryder, M. Subbiah, J. D. Kaplan, P.

The ToT technique is inspired by the human\nmind\u2019s approach for solving complex reasoning tasks through trial and error. In\nthis process, the human mind explores the solution space through a tree-like\nthought process, allowing for backtracking when necessary. To implement ToT\nas a software system, we augment an LLM with additional modules including a\nprompter agent, a checker module, a memory module, and a ToT controller. In\norder to solve a given problem, these modules engage in a multi-round conversation with the LLM. The memory module records the conversation and state\nhistory of the problem solving process, which allows the system to backtrack\nto the previous steps of the thought-process and explore other directions from\nthere. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed technique, we implemented\na ToT-based solver for the Sudoku Puzzle. Experimental results show that the\nToT framework can significantly increase the success rate of Sudoku puzzle solving. Our implementation of the ToT-based Sudoku solver is available on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/jieyilong/tree-of-thought-puzzle-solver.\n1\nIntroduction\nSelf-attention based auto-regressive large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 have recently\ntaken the world by storm [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. These LLMs excel at a variety of tasks that previously\nthought as extremely difficult or even impossible. For example, they are able to handle various\nlogical and mathematical reasoning tasks, particularly those that entail \u201cshort-range reasonings\u201d\nnecessitating only a few steps to arrive at conclusions [6, 7]. Such remarkable capabilities have\neven led to speculation that an early form of artificial general intelligence (AGI) may have already\nemerged [7]. However, today\u2019s LLMs still exhibit limitations in certain domains, especially for\n\u201clong-range\u201d reasoning tasks, where long-term planning and solution exploration are necessary [7].\nWhen presenting a LLMs such as GPT-4 with a challenging problem solving task, especially the so\ncalled System-2 reasoning problems [8], the model does not always succeed. Although the generated\nanswer may be indicative of the correct direction, the derivation process frequently includes logical\nerrors. We hypothesize that there are two main contributing factors which limits the problem solving\nability of LLMs:\nLack of correctness checking: To ensure correctness, a good practice for a human solver is to\ncarry out verification procedures at every step of the problem-solving process, thereby ensuring the\ncredibility of the final solution. In comparison, auto-regressive language models do not explicitly\nperform logical correctness checks as it generates a new token based on the previous tokens. This\nlimits the model\u2019s capacity to rectify its own mistakes. A minor error could be amplified as the model\ngenerates more tokens, thereby leading to rapid solution quality deterioration and making it difficult\nto recover from mistakes.\nPreprint. Under review.\narXiv:2305.08291v1  [cs.AI]  15 May 2023\n\f(a) ToT search strategy.\n(b) ToT software system.\nFigure 1: (a) Details of the Tree-of-Thought search strategy, where a solid arrow means a search\nstep guided by the response from the LLM, and a dashed arrow indicates backtracking commanded\nby the ToT controller. (b) The software system implementing the Tree-of-Thought search strategy.\nIt enhances the problem solving capability of an LLM by augmenting it with additional modules\nincluding a prompter agent, a checker module, a memory module, and a ToT controller.\nSolution generated linearly: As mentioned above, LLMs typically generate a token based on the\npreceding sequence of tokens without backward editing. On the contrary, when a human solver\nattempts to solve a problem, she might backtrack to previous steps if a derivation step is incorrect,\nor if she becomes stuck and is unable to make further progress towards arriving at the final answer.\nFields Medal winner Terence Tao once shared his experiences solving hard math problems1: \u201cWhen I\nwas a kid, I had a romanticized notion of mathematics, that hard problems were solved in Eureka\nmoments of inspiration... With me, it\u2019s always, Let\u2019s try this. That gets me part of the way, or that\ndoesn\u2019t work. Now let\u2019s try this. Oh, there\u2019s a little shortcut here... You work on it long enough\nand you happen to make progress towards a hard problem by a back door at some point. At the\nend, it\u2019s usually, oh, I\u2019ve solved the problem.\u201d The problem solving process as he described is a\ntree-like thinking process, rather than a linear chain-of-thought [9]. The limitation of linear response\ngeneration is also apparent from a computational complexity perspective. The number of computation\nsteps an auto-regressive LLM can perform is polynomial in terms of its input length. Unless P =\nNP holds which contradicts the widely accepted belief, there would be problems in NP that is not\nsolvable by auto-regressive LLMs.\nInspired by these two shortcomings of auto-regressive LLMs, we propose a novel framework which\naugments an LLM with several additional modules including an automatic \u201cprompter agent\u201d. This\nframework employs a solution search strategy we call the Tree-of-Thought (ToT2). This strategy\nsolves a problem through a multi-round conversation between the LLM and the prompter agent.\nFigure 1a provides a visual description of the ToT search strategy, in which the LLM plays a crucial\nrole in guiding the search for solutions. To make it more concrete, let us assume the problem to be\nsolved is an instance of the Sudoku puzzle. The \u201croot\u201d node represents the initial state, corresponding\nto when a human mind just reads through the problem description, and begins the thinking process.\nA blue node in the figure represents a valid partial solution, which can be used by the LLM as a basis\nto generate the next search step. In the context of Sudoku puzzle solving, this means presenting a\npartially filled Sudoku board to an LLM and letting the LLM fill in a few more cells. The rationale\nis that an LLM like GPT-4 has been trained on a vast amount of text corpus which includes many\nSudoku puzzle solutions. Given a partially filled board, likely the LLM is able to recognize the\npattern, and provide useful insights on how to proceed following the Sudoku rules. Hence, it is highly\nprobable that a search guided by the LLM is significantly more efficient than a brute-force search. In\nthe figure, the search steps guided by the LLM are represented by the solid arrows. However, these\nsteps generated by the LLM are not guaranteed to be always logically correct. Thus, we introduce\n1https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/Terence-Tao-Mozart-of-Math-7252\n2The word \u201ctot\u201d means a very young child, which is an interesting analogy as this work is a preliminary\nexploration into the potential for automated problem-solving utilizing language models.\n2\n\fa \u201cchecker module\u201d to perform correctness checks. In Figure 1a, a gray node with an \u201cX\u201d marker\nrepresents a \u201cdead-end\u201d, i.e. a partial solution that the checker module considers as invalid. For\nSudoku, this means the partially filled board violates the Sudoku rules. If the current node is invalid,\nobviously we need to return to a parent or an ancestor node in order to correct the mistake. This\ncan be coordinated by a module called the \u201cToT controller\u201d which oversees the ToT search. With\nthe backtracking capability, the system can regenerate the solution and thus recover from errors. In\naddition, even when the current node is valid, if the system remains stuck at it for too long, the ToT\ncontroller could issue a backtrack signal to explore other possible solutions. This is similar to a\nscenario where a human mind realizes that there is no viable path towards reaching the final solution\nthrough a particular direction, prompting her to change course and explore alternative routes. This\nprocess continues until either a full solution is found (represented by a green node in the figure), or a\npre-specified maximum round of conversations is reached.\nNote that while the above discussion utilized Sudoku solving as a tangible example to illustrate\nour main ideas, the ToT framework can potentially be applied to more general mathematical and\nlogical reasoning tasks. For example, in the context of mathematical theorem proving, a full solution\ncorresponds to the complete proof, encompassing a total of n derivation steps. On the other hand, a\npartial solution refers to a subset of these steps, specifically the initial k steps, where k is less than n.\nThe checker verifies the logically correctness of a given partial proof. In parallel, the prompter agent\nand the ToT controller can offer hints and suggestions to the LLM, encouraging it to think about the\nsubsequent proving step, or explore different directions for theorem proving when necessary.\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of the ToT framework, we implemented a ToT-based Sudoku puzzle\nsolver and evaluate it on a suite of Sudoku puzzle benchmarks we created. As shown by the\nexperimental results in Section 4.2, the ToT framework can significantly increase the success rate of\nSudoku puzzle solving.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature and\ncompared our approach with the most relevant works. Section 3 provides the details of the ToT\nsystem architecture. Section 4 describes our implementation of a ToT-based Sudoku puzzle solver\nand presents the experimental results. Finally, Section 5 discusses the limitation of the present work,\nand potential future extensions of the ToT framework.\n2\nRelated Works\nDeveloping intelligent systems that can reason has long been one of the primary goals of artificial\nintelligence [10, 11, 12]. Recent advancements in large language models, particularly the discovery of\ntheir emergent properties and in-context learning abilities, have opened up a new avenue for machine\nreasoning [6, 7, 9]. It is discovered that prompting language models using chain-of-thought and\nother hints can elicit them to output step-by-step solutions for mathematical and logical reasoning\ntasks [9, 13]. Building on these findings, recent studies have also explored the practice of sampling\nmultiple solutions and using self-consistency or complexity-based criteria to determine the optimal\nresponse [14, 15]. Experiments were also conducted to evaluate the performance of different prompts\n[15]. The self-taught reasoner (STaR) [16] is a technique which asks an LLM to generate reasoning\nchains and drop those producing incorrect answers. Then, the model is fine-tuned with the remaining\nvalid reasoning chains.\nDespite showing high potential, these techniques often necessitate human involvement. For example,\nchain-of-thought style prompting techniques require carefully hand-crafted examples and is thus\ndifficult to scale. Consequently, researchers have started to explore the possibility of automatic\nprompt generation. Early exploration in this domain includes AutoPrompt [17], prefix-tuning [18],\nand parameter-efficient prompt tuning [19]. This research direction received even more attention\nlately. In a recent study [20], the authors experimented with training verifiers to check if the solution\nprovided by an LLM to an given mathematical problem is logically correct. If the trained verifier can\neffectively judge the LLM outputs, it would provide another avenue for prompt evaluation. Automatic\nprompt engineer [21] examines a method to select the best prompt from a set of model-generated\ncandidates. The three-phase augment-prune-select method was suggested in [22]. It first generates\nmultiple chain-of-thought candidates, which was then pruned based on whether the derived answer\nmatches with the ground truths. Finally, a policy gradient based method was used to select the optimal\ncombination of several rationale chains from the pool for CoT prompting.\n3\n\fVery recently researchers have also turned their attention to augmenting LLM with additional agents\nfor various purposes. This is also the research field that is most relevant to our current work. AutoGPT\n[23] is a program which combines GPT-4 with additional modules including an execution agent and a\nmemory unit. It can chain together LLM \u201cthoughts\u201d, in order to autonomously achieve whatever goal\nthe user sets. PromptPG [24] proposes an approach that can learn to select in-context examples from\na small amount of training data via policy gradient for prompt learning. The PromptPG agent learns\nto find optimal in-context examples from a candidate pool, with the goal of maximizing the prediction\nrewards on given training examples when interacting with the GPT-3 environment. DEPS [25] is\na proposal that utilizes multi-step reasoning and sub-task error correction to tackle complex tasks\nwith long-range dependencies. By being able to provide explanations for errors in sub-tasks within\na trial, DEPS exhibits remarkable performance. ReAct [26] is an approach that employs emergent\nproperties present in LLMs, such as traces of verbal reasoning, to enable agents to reason and take\naction, resulting in impressive performance on different text-based benchmarks. Building on top of\nReAct, Reflexion [27] is an approach that equips an agent with dynamic memory and self-reflection\ncapabilities, improving its existing reasoning trace and ability to choose task-specific actions. To\nachieve complete automation, a simple but effective heuristic was designed to enable the agent to\nidentify hallucination instances and prevent repetitive action sequences. Our proposal shares some\ncommonalities with these approaches, for example, the use of a memory module and additional\nagents for automatic prompt generation. However, our approach is unique in that it introduces a\nToT controller which can explicitly conduct backtracking when necessary. This not only allows the\nsystem to recover from mistakes, but potentially can also enlarge the solution search space.\n3\nArchitecture\n3.1\nThe Tree-of-Thought Framework\nFigure 1b depicts the software system that implements the ToT Framework. As mentioned earlier, it\nincorporates several components which enhance the problem solving capability of the LLM, including\na prompter agent, a checker module, a memory module, and a ToT controller.\nThe problem solving process starts with the user inputting the problem description. The prompter\nagent then relays the problem to the LLM, with additional prompt text which encourages the LLM\nto come up with an intermediate solution instead of trying to reach the full solution in a single shot.\nAfter receiving the response from the LLM, the checker module is invoked to check the validity of\nthe intermediate solution generated. If it passes the correctness check, the intermediate solution will\nbe parsed and stored in the memory module. Then, based on the content of the memory module, the\nprompter agent generates a prompt to encourage the LLM to generate the next step. Conversely, if\nthe LLM generates an invalid intermediate solution, the ToT controller will activate the prompter to\noffer hints to the LLM and request it to consider again. Note that in general, a valid intermediate\nsolution does not always leads to the correct final solution. In order to prevent getting stuck, the ToT\ncontroller constantly monitors the search process and determines whether to continue trying from the\ncurrent node or backtrack to a parent or an ancestor node and explore alternative directions.\nThe ToT strategy can be viewed as a tree-search algorithm using an LLM as a heuristic for generating\nthe search steps. In this setting, the LLM is only used for the \u201cshort-range reasoning\u201d tasks, i.e\nderiving the next intermediate solution, which is a type of tasks that have been shown to have a high\nsuccess rate for LLMs [7]. On the other hand, by introducing the checker, the system have a higher\nlikelihood to discover the mistakes it makes as it generates the solutions. Moreover, by allowing the\nsystem to backtrack from a valid but somewhat \u201chopeless\u201d intermediate solution, the system is able to\nexplore a larger solution space, which enhances the \u201clong-range reasoning\u201d capability of the system\nas a whole. The ToT framework thus combines the best of both world. Furthermore, this multi-round\nconversation technique increases the number of computation steps the system can perform. Thus,\nbased on the time hierarchy theorem in computational complexity theory [28], the ToT framework\ncan expand the range of problems that can potentially be solved compared to relying solely on a\nsingle round of conversation with an LLM.\n3.2\nToT Modules\nIn this section we provide more details of the components of the ToT software system.\n4\n\fChecker Module. The checker module can either be rule-based or implemented as a deep neural\nnetwork. For problems that have an explicit polynomial time algorithm for correctness checking (i.e.\nproblems in NP), rule-based checkers can be implemented. Numerous important mathematical and\nlogical problems are in this category, for example, equation solving, polynomial factoring, 3SAT, and\npuzzles like Sudoku. With a rule-based checker, the ToT software can be viewed as a hybrid system\nwhich allows explicitly encoding prior knowledge (e.g. the Sudoku rules) into a neural network\npowered system. An alternative is to train and use a neural network based classifier as the checker\n[20]. This is especially useful for problems where a rule-based checker is difficult to implement, e.g.\nchecking whether a mathematical proof is correct.\nMemory Module. The memory module can be used to store the entire conversation history between\nthe LLM and the prompter agent, as well as other supplemental data useful for problem solving. The\ndata stored can be served as the information source for the prompter agent to generate helpful hints\nfor the LLM.\nToT Controller. The ToT controller oversees the entire ToT search. It can be implemented in a\nnumber of ways. It can be as simple as encoding two rules: 1) if the checker thinks the current partial\nsolution is invalid, backtrack to the parent node, and 2) if the current partial solution is valid, but the\nToT search tree has explored its C children and yet failed to find the final solution, then backtrack to\nthe parent node. Here C is an pre-configured integer.\nA more advanced version of the ToT controller can employ a policy network to determine the\nbacktracking policy. The network\u2019s inputs include the recent search history comprised of the sequence\nof the last k +1 node visited in the search tree si\u2212k, .., si\u22121, si (k is a hyper-parameter). The network\nalso takes in ci, a Boolean variable which indicates whether the checker module considers the current\nnode si is valid. We can sample from the policy to determine the next action ai:\nai \u223c \u03c0t\n\u03c1(a|ci, si, .., si\u2212k), a \u2208 Acand\n(1)\nwhere \u03c0t\n\u03c1 represents the policy network of the ToT controller with parameters \u03c1. The set of candidate\nactions Acand includes simply staying at the current node to generate the next step, and backtracking\nto the parent or an ancestor node at most L levels up in the search tree where L is a hyper-parameter.\nThus, we can use one-hot encoding for the actions, where backtracking j levels up is represented by a\nvector where only the jth position is set to 1. The action vector a and checker output ci are processed\nby a feed-forward network (FFN) to for deep features extraction. A linear layer with learnable\nparameters W1 and b1 is added on top of the FFN to map its output to a vector g(a, ci). The latest\nk + 1 visited nodes are concatenated into a string, and then added with position embedding (PE),\nand finally inputted into a self-attention model [1]. The idea is that by adding position embedding,\nthe attention model will be able to make decisions based on the sequence of the recent node visits.\nA linear layer with learnable parameters W2 and b2 is added on top of the attention model to\ntransform its output to a vector g(si, .., si\u2212k) whose dimension matches with that of g(a, ci). Finally,\nwe calculate the inner-products of these two vectors, and use the softmax function to compute the\nprobability of each action candidate:\ng(a, ci) = W1 \u00b7 FFN(a, ci) + b1\ng(si, .., si\u2212k) = W2 \u00b7 Attention(PE(si\u2212k||..||si\u22121||si)) + b2\n\u03c0t\n\u03c1(a|ci, si, .., si\u2212k) =\nexp(g(a, ci) \u00b7 g(si, .., si\u2212k))\n\ufffd\na\u2032\u2208Acand exp(g(a\u2032, ci) \u00b7 g(si, .., si\u2212k))\n(2)\nIn the above formula, \u201c||\u201d is the string concatenation operator. Section 3.3 will discuss the training\nalgorithm for the ToT controller policy network.\nPrompter Agent. The prompter agent gives hints to the LLM for it to generate the next search step.\nThe most basic hint can be a generic prompt using the following template: generic_tmpl = \u201cFor the\ngiven problem: [problem description], we have come up with a partial solution: [partial solution\nsummary]. Please derive the next step on top of this partial solution, and return the next step in\nthe following JSON format {next_step: <next_step>}\u201d. Note that the template requires the LLM to\nrespond with a structured JSON string. This is a trick to make it easier for the checker to extract the\nnext step from the LLM response. To create an actual prompt from this template, the prompter needs\nthe [problem description] and the [partial solution summary], both of which can be queried from the\nmemory module.\n5\n\fAlgorithm 1 Policy Gradient based Training Algorithm for the ToT System\n1: Input: training set Ptrain, num of training epochs N\n2: procedure REINFORCE(Ptrain, N)\n3:\nrandomly initialized the ToT Controller policy \u03c0t\n\u03c1\n4:\nrandomly initialized the Prompter agent policy \u03c0p\n\u03b8\n5:\nfor epoch = 1, 2, .., N do\n6:\n\u03c0w \u2190 \u03c0t\n\u03c1 if epoch is even, \u03c0p\n\u03b8 otherwise \u25b7 update the selected policy only, fix the other\n7:\nfor pi \u2208 Ptrain do\n8:\nri \u2190 reward(ToTSystem(pi)) \u25b7 attempt to solve problem pi and obtain reward ri\n9:\nw \u2190 w + \u03b1\u2207wlog\u03c0wri\n10:\nend for\n11:\nend for\n12: end procedure\nSimilar to the ToT controller, we can also implement the prompter agent as a policy network, which\ncan generate prompts based on the current partial solution and the conversation history. First we\ndefine the prompt template as follows: prompt_tmpl = generic_tmpl || \u201cHere are a few examples:\n[in-context learning examples].\u201d, where || is the string concatenation operator. The variable [in\ncontext learning examples] are in-context learning examples for the problem being solved, which can\nbe picked by the prompter policy network from a set of candidates, similar to the PromptPG approach\n[24]. The rationale is that given the current and recently attempted intermediate solution, some\nin-context examples might work better than others as hints for the next step. Given the recently visited\nnode sequence si\u2212k, .., si\u22121, si, our goal is to select l examples ei = {e1\ni , e2\ni , ..., el\ni|ej\ni \u2208 Ecand}\nwhere Ecand is a pool of in-context learning example candidates. The examples are selected according\non a policy:\nej\ni \u223c \u03c0p\n\u03b8(e|si, .., si\u2212k), ej\ni \u2208 Ecand for j = 1, 2, ..., l\n(3)\nwhere \u03c0p\n\u03b8 represents the policy network of the prompter agent with parameters \u03b8.\nWith the\nset of selected examples, the prompter agent generates a prompt from the template: pi =\nprompter(prompt_tmpl, ei, si), which can be fed into the LLM to obtain the next intermediate\nsolution si+1 = LLM(pi). The neural network architecture for the prompter\u2019s policy network is\nsimilar to that of the ToT controller. The only difference is that since the in-context examples are\nexpressed in natural language, instead of FFN, we use an attention model to process them:\nh(e) = M1 \u00b7 Attention(e) + c1\nh(si, .., si\u2212k) = M2 \u00b7 Attention(PE(si\u2212k||..||si\u22121||si)) + c2\n\u03c0p\n\u03b8(e|si, .., si\u2212k) =\nexp(h(e) \u00b7 h(si, .., si\u2212k))\n\ufffd\ne\u2032\u2208Ecand exp(h(e\u2032) \u00b7 h(si, .., si\u2212k))\n(4)\nThe prompter policy network can be trained together with the ToT controller using multi-agent\nreinforcement learning methods. The training algorithm of the prompter\u2019s policy network is discussed\nin Section 3.3.\n3.3\nToT System Training\nIn the previous sections, we have described the multi-agent ToT framework. This section dives into\nhow we can train the agents, in particular, the policy networks of the ToT controller and the prompter\nagent. While there are many multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms (MARL) proposed in\nthe literature [29, 30, 31], in this work we adopt a relatively simple approach which uses a modified\nversion of the REINFORCE algorithm [32] to train the policy networks of the ToT controller and the\nprompter agent directly. The more advanced MARL algorithms will be explored in the future.\nFirst, we define a run of the ToT system as the process where a user inputs the problem description,\nand the ToT system attempts to solve the problem until it thinks the problem is solved, or a prespecified maximum round of conversations is reached. Next, we define the reward r of a run: if the\nproblem is correctly solved, then r = +1. Otherwise, if the system outputs an incorrect solution, or\nthe maximum round of conversations is reached, then r = \u22121.\n6\n\fAlgorithm 2 Problem Solving Using the ToT System\n1: Input: problem description from the user puser, max num of conversation rounds K\n2: procedure SOLVE(puser, K)\n3:\nprompt \u2190 Prompter(puser)\n4:\nfor round = 1, 2, .., K do\n5:\nresponse \u2190 LLM(prompt)\n6:\nresult \u2190 Checker(response)\n7:\nif result.isValidFinalSolution() then\n8:\nreturn (result.solution)\n9:\nend if\n10:\nmemory.store(result)\n11:\nctrl_signal \u2190 ToTController(memory)\n12:\nprompt \u2190 Prompter(memory, ctrl_signal)\n13:\nend for\n14:\nreturn (nil)\n15: end procedure\nThe training algorithm is provided in Algorithm 1. The algorithm takes two inputs, the training data set\nPtrain, and the number of training epochs N (Line 1-2). The two policy networks \u03c0t\n\u03c1(ai|si, .., si\u2212k)\nand \u03c0p\n\u03b8(ei|si, .., si\u2212k) are randomly initialized (Line 3-4). We train the two policy networks in turns,\ni.e. training one network with policy gradient while keeping the other fixed (Line 6). To be more\nspecific, when the current epoch is an even number, we select the ToT controller policy \u03c0t\n\u03c1, and keep\nthe parameters of the prompter agent fixed. Otherwise, we select the prompter agent policy \u03c0p\n\u03b8 and fix\nthe ToT controller policy. Next, the algorithm updates the parameters of the selected policy network\nusing the policy gradient method (Line 7-9). For each problem in the training data, we attempt to\nsolve it with a ToT system run. Based on the result, we obtain the reward for that run (Line 8). The\nentire training algorithm runs for N epochs.\n3.4\nProblem Solving Using the ToT System\nAfter the ToT system is trained, we can use it for inference, i.e. problem solving. Algorithm 2\nprovides the pseudo code for solving problems using the ToT system. It starts with a user inputting\ndescription of the problem (Line 1-2). The prompter module then converts the user input into a\nprompt (Line 3) using a prompt template for user input, for example: user_input_prompt = \u201cFor\nthe given problem: [problem description], please derive the first step, and return the step in the\nfollowing JSON format {next_step: <next_step>}\u201d.\nNext, up to K rounds of conversations with the LLM are conducted for problem solving (Line 4).\nIn each round, the LLM first produces a response for the given prompt (Line 5). Then, the checker\nanalyzes the response, and returns a result (Line 6). The result contains the partial solution extracted\nfrom the LLM response, as well as information like whether the checker considers the solution as a\nvalid final solution, a valid intermediate solution, or an invalid partial solution, etc. If the solution\nis a valid final solution, the algorithm simply returns it (Line 7-9). Otherwise, the result is stored\nin the memory module (Line 10). Based on the content of the memory module, the ToT controller\nissues control signals, e.g. backtracking for l levels, to the prompter (Line 11). Finally, based on\nthe control signal, the prompter looks up the relevant information from the memory module, and\nproduce the next prompt for the LLM (Line 12). If no valid final solution is found within K rounds\nof conversations, the algorithm return nil indicating it fails to solve the problem (Line 14).\n4\nEvaluation\nThis section provides the evaluation methodology and experimental results for our proposed ToT\nframework. Our evaluation focuses on the ToT-based solver for the Sudoku problem. At the first\nglance, Sudoku problems seem to be just brain teasers with little practical importance. However,\nthe generalized Sudoku problem on n2 \u00d7 n2 grids of n \u00d7 n blocks is known to be NP-complete\n[33]. If the ToT framework can solve instances of the generalized Sudoku problem (granted that\nit might takes an exponential number of rounds of conversations), in principle it can handle many\n7\n\f3x3 puzzles\n4x4 puzzles\n5x5 puzzles\n0\n0.5\n1\n0.4\n0.2\n0.1\n0.9\n0.4\n0.5\n0.9\n0.5\n0.5\n1\n0.9\n0.8\nSuccess rate\nzs\nos\nfs\ntot\nFigure 2: Experimental results comparing the success rate of different LLM-based Sudoku puzzle\nsolvers across three sets of benchmarks.\nother mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. In fact, it is straightforward to re-purpose the\nimplementation described below to solve other puzzles, such as 3SAT, 3-coloring, etc. Below we\nfirst describe the implementation details of the solver. Then, we present the test suite used in our\nevaluation, as well as the experimental results.\n4.1\nToT Solver for Sudoku Puzzles\nThe ToT-based Sudoku solver follows the generic framework described in Section 3 with some\nspecific tweaks for the Sudoku problem. It allows a user to input a Sudoku puzzle using natural\nlanguages, for example: \u201cPlease solve this 4x4 Sudoku puzzle [[3,*,*,2],[1,*,3,*],[*,1,*,3],[4,*,*,1]]\nwhere * represents a cell to be filled\u201d.\nWe have implemented the ToT-based Sudoku solver as described in Section 4.1 in Python. We\nadopted a rule-based approach for the checker module since the Sudoku rules are precise and easy\nto check. The memory module stores the conversation history between the prompter and the LLM,\nas well as a search tree which maintains all the partially filled Sudoku board the LLM has generated\nso far. This way, when backtracking happens, the previous board configuration can be retrieved.\nThe ToT controller in our implementation is also rule-based. It returns to the parent node in the\nsearch tree if either the current node considered invalid by the checker, or the search algorithm has\nexplored more than 5 children of the current node. Finally the prompter agent uses a variation of\nthe generic template mentioned above, with the [problem description] being the initial configuration\nof the Sudoku board input by the user, and [partial solution summary] being the partially filled\nboard represented by the current node in the search tree. The LLM utilized in this study is the\n\"gpt-3.5-turbo\" model, which is accessible through the OpenAI API suite. The temperature parameter\nwas set to 1 in our experiments.\n4.2\nExperimental Results\nWe have implemented four LLM-based Sudoku puzzle solvers and compared their performance: 1)\nzero-shot solver (zs) which directly posts the puzzle description to the LLM, 2) one-shot solver (os)\nwhich provides a chain-of-thought style step-by-step solution of a 3x3 Sudoku puzzle as an example\nin addition to the problem description, 3) few-shot solver (fs) which provides multiple examples\nwith CoT-style solutions, and 4) our proposed Tree-of-Thought solver (tot). We constructed three\nbenchmarks, comprising of ten 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5 Sudoku puzzles, respectively. The objective of\na solver is to fill the n \u00d7 n Sudoku grid with digits so that each row and column contain all of the\ndigits from 1 to n (n = 3, 4, 5 in our experiments).\nFigure 2 compares the success rates of different LLM-based solvers across the three benchmarks.\nHere the term success rate refers to the fraction of problems in a benchmark set that are successfully\nsolved by a solver. For example, if a solver is able to solve 4 out of 10 problems in the \u201c3x3 puzzles\u201d\nbenchmark set, then the success rate of this solver for this benchmark set is 0.4. As expected, the\nzero-shot solver has the worst performance across all the three set of benchmarks. Adding CoT-style\nstep-by-step examples significantly boosts the success rate, especially for the 3x3 puzzles. This is\nexpected, since one can pretty much rely on \u201cshort-range\u201d reasoning skills, which is a strength of the\n8\n\fLLM models, to solve a small-sized 3x3 Sudoku puzzle, espcially when CoT-style hints are provided.\nHowever, as the puzzle size gets bigger, the success rate of the one-shot and few-shot solver dropped\nto around 0.5. This is because solving bigger puzzles requires trial and error, which is a capability\nLLMs generally lack of as discussed earlier.\nIn comparison, the ToT-based solver demonstrates superior performance when compared to the other\nsolvers. For the 3x3 benchmark set, it was able to solve all the puzzles. The success rate improves\nby 11% compared to the second best for the two benchmark sets. For the 4x4 benchmark set, the\nToT-based solver failed to find the solution for 1 out of the 10 puzzles before reaching the maximum\nround of conversations (which is set to 100 in our experiments). We suspect it is due to the limited\ncapability of the rule-based ToT controller. In particular, the rule-based controller has no sense of\nwhether the current partially-filled board can be completed without violating the Sudoku rules, which\ndecreases the efficiency of the solution search. We expect a neural network based ToT controller will\nperform better, which we will verify in the future extension of this work. Despite this, the success\nrate of the ToT based solver is still 80% higher compared to that of the one-shot and few-shot based\nsolvers. Finally, for the 5x5 puzzles, the ToT-based solver failed with 2 puzzles before reaching the\nmaximum round of conversations. Nonetheless, the success rate is 60% higher compared to that of\nthe one-shot and few-shot based solvers.\n5\nDiscussions and Future Works\nIn this paper, we presented the Tree-of-Thought framework, which enhances LLMs with additional\nagents and memory modules, resulting in improved performance for mathematical problem-solving\ntasks. To evaluate the performance of this technique, we implemented a Sudoku puzzle solver based\non the ToT framework. One of the limitations of the current implementation is that it utilizes a\nrule-based checker that contains custom logic, making it less easily adaptable to other problems. For\nmore generic problems, for example, general mathematical and logical reasoning problems, where\nrule-based solution checking is difficult to implement, a future direction is to explore checkers based\non neural network or other probabilistic models. Moreover, the experiments we conducted in this\nwork also uses a rule-based ToT controller, which as we pointed out, has limited capabilities. In the\nfuture, we will implement the neural network based ToT controller which can hopefully enhance the\nsystem performance. Additionally, the policy-gradient based training algorithm proposed in this work\nis relatively simple and may be susceptible to training stability issues. To further optimize the ToT\nsystem, more advanced multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly those designed\nfor cooperative agents, could be adopted.\nAnother intriguing future direction is to investigate the potential of utilizing the \u201cself-play\u201d technique\nto enable the ToT system to develop novel problem solving strategies that are not found in the LLM\u2019s\ntraining text corpus. The self-play training method is a reinforcement learning technique which was\npopularized by the development of competitive game-playing agents such as AlphaGo and AlphaStar\n[34, 35, 36], where an AI agent learns to improve its own strategy by playing against itself. Today\u2019s\nLLMs are typically trained using self-supervised learning techniques. They may have limitations\nwhen it comes to problem-solving, as they may not be able to generate samples (i.e. novel problem\nsolving strategies) that fall outside the distribution of the training data. In other words, they may not\nbe able to \u201cthink outside the box\u201d, which is a crucial human trait that facilitates the discovery of new\nknowledge. Compared to self-supervised learning, self-play based reinforcement learning enables the\nsystem to access a much broader solution space beyond the provided training examples, allowing for\ngreater improvement. AlphaGo and similar systems have demonstrated the ability to devise strategies\nthat surpass even those of human experts. Inspired by these examples, for ToT system training,\ninstead of relying on the training data set Ptrain, we can introduce a \u201cquizzer\u201d module which can\ncome up with problem descriptions on its own to train the ToT controller and the prompter agent. It\nis worth mentioning that one of the key enablers for training AlphaGo and similar system is that the\nenvironment reward can be precisely determined, as it is straightforward to determine whether the\ngameplay results in a win or a loss. The ToT framework incorporates a checker that can assess the\ncorrectness of the solution, functioning similarly to the environment, particularly for problems that\nhave well-defined solution validation rules. Thus, the reinforcement learning training methods can be\nreadily applied. We suspect that this self-driven learning approach, similar to the self-play method,\ncould be an effective means of improving the ToT framework\u2019s problem-solving capabilities beyond\nthe solution examples provided in the training text corpus for the LLMs.\n9\n\fReferences\n[1] Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan N.

The ToT technique is inspired by the human mind's approach for solving complex reasoning tasks through trial and error. In this process, the human mind explores the solution space through a tree-like thought process, allowing for backtracking when necessary. To implement ToT as a software system, we augment an LLM with additional modules including a prompter agent, a checker module, a memory module, and a ToT controller. In order to solve a given problem, these modules engage in a multi-round conversation with the LLM. The memory module records the conversation and state history of the problem solving process, which allows the system to backtrack to the previous steps of the thought-process and explore other directions from there. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed technique, we implemented a ToT-based solver for the Sudoku Puzzle. Experimental results show that the ToT framework can significantly increase the success rate of Sudoku puzzle solving. Our implementation of the ToT-based Sudoku solver is available on GitHub: [https://github.com/jieyilong/tree-of-thought-puzzle-solver](https://github.com/jieyilong/tree-of-thought-puzzle-solver).\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nSelf-attention based auto-regressive large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 have recently taken the world by storm [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6]. These LLMs excel at a variety of tasks that previously thought as extremely difficult or even impossible. For example, they are able to handle various logical and mathematical reasoning tasks, particularly those that entail \"short-range reasonings\" necessitating only a few steps to arrive at conclusions [6; 7]. Such remarkable capabilities have even led to speculation that an early form of artificial general intelligence (AGI) may have already emerged [7]. However, today's LLMs still exhibit limitations in certain domains, especially for \"long-range\" reasoning tasks, where long-term planning and solution exploration are necessary [7]. When presenting a LLMs such as GPT-4 with a challenging problem solving task, especially the so called System-2 reasoning problems [8], the model does not always succeed. Although the generated answer may be indicative of the correct direction, the derivation process frequently includes logical errors. We hypothesize that there are two main contributing factors which limits the problem solving ability of LLMs:\n\n**Lack of correctness checking**: To ensure correctness, a good practice for a human solver is to carry out verification procedures at _every step_ of the problem-solving process, thereby ensuring the credibility of the final solution. In comparison, auto-regressive language models do not explicitly perform logical correctness checks as it generates a new token based on the previous tokens. This limits the model's capacity to rectify its own mistakes. A minor error could be amplified as the model generates more tokens, thereby leading to rapid solution quality deterioration and making it difficult to recover from mistakes.\n\n**Solution generated linearly**: As mentioned above, LLMs typically generate a token based on the preceding sequence of tokens without backward editing. On the contrary, when a human solver attempts to solve a problem, she might backtrack to previous steps if a derivation step is incorrect, or if she becomes stuck and is unable to make further progress towards arriving at the final answer. Fields Medal winner Terence Tao once shared his experiences solving hard math problems1: \"When I was a kid, I had a romanticized notion of mathematics, that hard problems were solved in Eureka moments of inspiration... With me, it's always, Let's try this. That gets me part of the way, or that doesn't work. Now let's try this. Oh, there's a little shortcut here... You work on it long enough and you happen to make progress towards a hard problem by a back door at some point. At the end, it's usually, oh, I've solved the problem.\" The problem solving process as he described is a _tree-like_ thinking process, rather than a _linear_ chain-of-thought [9]. The limitation of linear response generation is also apparent from a computational complexity perspective. The number of computation steps an auto-regressive LLM can perform is polynomial in terms of its input length. Unless **P** = **NP** holds which contradicts the widely accepted belief, there would be problems in **NP** that is not solvable by auto-regressive LLMs.\n\nFootnote 1: [https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/Terence-Tao-Mozart-of-Math-7252](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/Terence-Tao-Mozart-of-Math-7252)\n\nInspired by these two shortcomings of auto-regressive LLMs, we propose a novel framework which augments an LLM with several additional modules including an automatic \"prompter agent\". This framework employs a solution search strategy we call the _Tree-of-Thought (ToT2_). This strategy solves a problem through a multi-round conversation between the LLM and the prompter agent. Figure 0(a) provides a visual description of the ToT search strategy, in which the LLM plays a crucial role in _guiding_ the search for solutions. To make it more concrete, let us assume the problem to be solved is an instance of the Sudoku puzzle. The \"root\" node represents the initial state, corresponding to when a human mind just reads through the problem description, and begins the thinking process. A blue node in the figure represents a valid partial solution, which can be used by the LLM as a basis to generate the next search step. In the context of Sudoku puzzle solving, this means presenting a partially filled Sudoku board to an LLM and letting the LLM fill in a few more cells. The rationale is that an LLM like GPT-4 has been trained on a vast amount of text corpus which includes many Sudoku puzzle solutions. Given a partially filled board, likely the LLM is able to recognize the pattern, and provide useful insights on how to proceed following the Sudoku rules. Hence, it is highly probable that a search guided by the LLM is significantly more efficient than a brute-force search. In the figure, the search steps guided by the LLM are represented by the solid arrows. However, these steps generated by the LLM are not guaranteed to be always logically correct. Thus, we introduce\n\nFigure 1: (a) Details of the Tree-of-Thought search strategy, where a solid arrow means a search step guided by the response from the LLM, and a dashed arrow indicates backtracking commanded by the ToT controller. (b) The software system implementing the Tree-of-Thought search strategy. It enhances the problem solving capability of an LLM by augmenting it with additional modules including a prompter agent, a checker module, a memory module, and a ToT controller.\n\na \"checker module\" to perform correctness checks. In Figure 0(a), a gray node with an \"X\" marker represents a \"dead-end\", i.e. a partial solution that the checker module considers as invalid. For Sudoku, this means the partially filled board violates the Sudoku rules. If the current node is invalid, obviously we need to return to a parent or an ancestor node in order to correct the mistake. This can be coordinated by a module called the \"ToT controller\" which oversees the ToT search. With the backtracking capability, the system can regenerate the solution and thus recover from errors. In addition, even when the current node is valid, if the system remains stuck at it for too long, the ToT controller could issue a backtrack signal to explore other possible solutions. This is similar to a scenario where a human mind realizes that there is no viable path towards reaching the final solution through a particular direction, prompting her to change course and explore alternative routes. This process continues until either a full solution is found (represented by a green node in the figure), or a pre-specified maximum round of conversations is reached.\n\nNote that while the above discussion utilized Sudoku solving as a tangible example to illustrate our main ideas, the ToT framework can potentially be applied to more general mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. For example, in the context of mathematical theorem proving, a full solution corresponds to the complete proof, encompassing a total of \\(n\\) derivation steps. On the other hand, a partial solution refers to a subset of these steps, specifically the initial \\(k\\) steps, where \\(k\\) is less than \\(n\\). The checker verifies the logically correctness of a given partial proof. In parallel, the prompter agent and the ToT controller can offer hints and suggestions to the LLM, encouraging it to think about the subsequent proving step, or explore different directions for theorem proving when necessary.\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of the ToT framework, we implemented a ToT-based Sudoku puzzle solver and evaluate it on a suite of Sudoku puzzle benchmarks we created. As shown by the experimental results in Section 4.2, the ToT framework can significantly increase the success rate of Sudoku puzzle solving.\n\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature and compared our approach with the most relevant works. Section 3 provides the details of the ToT system architecture. Section 4 describes our implementation of a ToT-based Sudoku puzzle solver and presents the experimental results. Finally, Section 5 discusses the limitation of the present work, and potential future extensions of the ToT framework.\n\n## 2 Related Works\n\nDeveloping intelligent systems that can reason has long been one of the primary goals of artificial intelligence [10; 11; 12]. Recent advancements in large language models, particularly the discovery of their emergent properties and in-context learning abilities, have opened up a new avenue for machine reasoning [6; 7; 9]. It is discovered that prompting language models using chain-of-thought and other hints can elicit them to output step-by-step solutions for mathematical and logical reasoning tasks [9; 13]. Building on these findings, recent studies have also explored the practice of sampling multiple solutions and using self-consistency or complexity-based criteria to determine the optimal response [14; 15]. Experiments were also conducted to evaluate the performance of different prompts [15]. The self-taught reasoner (STaR) [16] is a technique which asks an LLM to generate reasoning chains and drop those producing incorrect answers. Then, the model is fine-tuned with the remaining valid reasoning chains.\n\nDespite showing high potential, these techniques often necessitate human involvement. For example, chain-of-thought style prompting techniques require carefully hand-crafted examples and is thus difficult to scale. Consequently, researchers have started to explore the possibility of automatic prompt generation. Early exploration in this domain includes AutoPrompt [17], prefix-tuning [18], and parameter-efficient prompt tuning [19]. This research direction received even more attention lately. In a recent study [20], the authors experimented with training verifiers to check if the solution provided by an LLM to an given mathematical problem is logically correct. If the trained verifier can effectively judge the LLM outputs, it would provide another avenue for prompt evaluation. Automatic prompt engineer [21] examines a method to select the best prompt from a set of model-generated candidates. The three-phase augment-prune-select method was suggested in [22]. It first generates multiple chain-of-thought candidates, which was then pruned based on whether the derived answer matches with the ground truths. Finally, a policy gradient based method was used to select the optimal combination of several rationale chains from the pool for CoT prompting.\n\nVery recently researchers have also turned their attention to augmenting LLM with additional agents for various purposes. This is also the research field that is most relevant to our current work. AutoGPT [23] is a program which combines GPT-4 with additional modules including an execution agent and a memory unit. It can chain together LLM \"thoughts\", in order to autonomously achieve whatever goal the user sets. PromptPG [24] proposes an approach that can learn to select in-context examples from a small amount of training data via policy gradient for prompt learning. The PromptPG agent learns to find optimal in-context examples from a candidate pool, with the goal of maximizing the prediction rewards on given training examples when interacting with the GPT-3 environment. DEPS [25] is a proposal that utilizes multi-step reasoning and sub-task error correction to tackle complex tasks with long-range dependencies. By being able to provide explanations for errors in sub-tasks within a trial, DEPS exhibits remarkable performance. ReAct [26] is an approach that employs emergent properties present in LLMs, such as traces of verbal reasoning, to enable agents to reason and take action, resulting in impressive performance on different text-based benchmarks. Building on top of ReAct, Reflexion [27] is an approach that equips an agent with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities, improving its existing reasoning trace and ability to choose task-specific actions. To achieve complete automation, a simple but effective heuristic was designed to enable the agent to identify hallucination instances and prevent repetitive action sequences. Our proposal shares some commonalities with these approaches, for example, the use of a memory module and additional agents for automatic prompt generation. However, our approach is unique in that it introduces a ToT controller which can explicitly conduct backtracking when necessary. This not only allows the system to recover from mistakes, but potentially can also enlarge the solution search space.\n\n## 3 Architecture\n\n### The Tree-of-Thought Framework\n\nFigure 0(b) depicts the software system that implements the ToT Framework. As mentioned earlier, it incorporates several components which enhance the problem solving capability of the LLM, including a _prompter agent_, a _checker module_, a _memory module_, and a _ToT controller_.\n\nThe problem solving process starts with the user inputting the problem description. The promoter agent then relays the problem to the LLM, with additional prompt text which encourages the LLM to come up with an intermediate solution instead of trying to reach the full solution in a single shot. After receiving the response from the LLM, the checker module is invoked to check the validity of the intermediate solution generated. If it passes the correctness check, the intermediate solution will be parsed and stored in the memory module. Then, based on the content of the memory module, the prompter agent generates a prompt to encourage the LLM to generate the next step. Conversely, if the LLM generates an invalid intermediate solution, the ToT controller will activate the prompter to offer hints to the LLM and request it to consider again. Note that in general, a valid intermediate solution does not always leads to the correct final solution. In order to prevent getting stuck, the ToT controller constantly monitors the search process and determines whether to continue trying from the current node or backtrack to a parent or an ancestor node and explore alternative directions.\n\nThe ToT strategy can be viewed as a tree-search algorithm using an LLM as a heuristic for generating the search steps. In this setting, the LLM is only used for the \"short-range reasoning\" tasks, i.e deriving the next intermediate solution, which is a type of tasks that have been shown to have a high success rate for LLMs [7]. On the other hand, by introducing the checker, the system have a higher likelihood to discover the mistakes it makes as it generates the solutions. Moreover, by allowing the system to backtrack from a valid but somewhat \"hopeless\" intermediate solution, the system is able to explore a larger solution space, which enhances the \"long-range reasoning\" capability of the system as a whole. The ToT framework thus combines the best of both world. Furthermore, this multi-round conversation technique increases the number of computation steps the system can perform. Thus, based on the time hierarchy theorem in computational complexity theory [28], the ToT framework can expand the range of problems that can potentially be solved compared to relying solely on a single round of conversation with an LLM.\n\n### ToT Modules\n\nIn this section we provide more details of the components of the ToT software system.\n\n**Checker Module**. The checker module can either be rule-based or implemented as a deep neural network. For problems that have an explicit polynomial time algorithm for correctness checking (i.e. problems in **NP**), rule-based checkers can be implemented. Numerous important mathematical and logical problems are in this category, for example, equation solving, polynomial factoring, 3SAT, and puzzles like Sudoku. With a rule-based checker, the ToT software can be viewed as a hybrid system which allows explicitly encoding prior knowledge (e.g. the Sudoku rules) into a neural network powered system. An alternative is to train and use a neural network based classifier as the checker [20]. This is especially useful for problems where a rule-based checker is difficult to implement, e.g. checking whether a mathematical proof is correct.\n\n**Memory Module**. The memory module can be used to store the entire conversation history between the LLM and the prompter agent, as well as other supplemental data useful for problem solving. The data stored can be served as the information source for the prompter agent to generate helpful hints for the LLM.\n\n**ToT Controller**. The ToT controller oversees the entire ToT search. It can be implemented in a number of ways. It can be as simple as encoding two rules: 1) if the checker thinks the current partial solution is invalid, backtrack to the parent node, and 2) if the current partial solution is valid, but the ToT search tree has explored its \\(C\\) children and yet failed to find the final solution, then backtrack to the parent node. Here \\(C\\) is an pre-configured integer.\n\nA more advanced version of the ToT controller can employ a policy network to determine the backtracking policy. The network's inputs include the recent search history comprised of the sequence of the last \\(k+1\\) node visited in the search tree \\(s_{i-k}\\), \\(..\\), \\(s_{i-1}\\), \\(s_{i}\\) (\\(k\\) is a hyper-parameter). The network also takes in \\(c_{i}\\), a Boolean variable which indicates whether the checker module considers the current node \\(s_{i}\\) is valid. We can sample from the policy to determine the next action \\(a_{i}\\):\n\n\\[a_{i}\\sim\\pi_{\\rho}^{t}(a|c_{i},s_{i},..,s_{i-k}),\\ a\\in A_{cand} \\tag{1}\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\pi_{\\rho}^{t}\\) represents the policy network of the ToT controller with parameters \\(\\rho\\). The set of candidate actions \\(A_{cand}\\) includes simply staying at the current node to generate the next step, and backtracking to the parent or an ancestor node at most \\(L\\) levels up in the search tree where \\(L\\) is a hyper-parameter. Thus, we can use one-hot encoding for the actions, where backtracking \\(j\\) levels up is represented by a vector where only the \\(j^{\\text{th}}\\) position is set to 1. The action vector \\(a\\) and checker output \\(c_{i}\\) are processed by a feed-forward network (FFN) to for deep features extraction. A linear layer with learnable parameters \\(\\mathbf{W}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}_{1}\\) is added on top of the FFN to map its output to a vector \\(\\mathbf{g}(a,c_{i})\\). The latest \\(k+1\\) visited nodes are concatenated into a string, and then added with position embedding (PE), and finally inputted into a self-attention model [1]. The idea is that by adding position embedding, the attention model will be able to make decisions based on the sequence of the recent node visits. A linear layer with learnable parameters \\(\\mathbf{W}_{2}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}_{2}\\) is added on top of the attention model to transform its output to a vector \\(\\mathbf{g}(s_{i},..,s_{i-k})\\) whose dimension matches with that of \\(\\mathbf{g}(a,c_{i})\\). Finally, we calculate the inner-products of these two vectors, and use the softmax function to compute the probability of each action candidate:\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\\mathbf{g}(a,c_{i})&=\\mathbf{W}_{1} \\cdot\\text{FFN}(a,c_{i})+\\mathbf{b}_{1}\\\\ \\mathbf{g}(s_{i},..,s_{i-k})&=\\mathbf{W}_{2}\\cdot \\text{Attention}(\\text{PE}(s_{i-k}||..||s_{i-1}||s_{i}))+\\mathbf{b}_{2}\\\\ \\pi_{\\rho}^{t}(a|c_{i},s_{i},..,s_{i-k})&=\\frac{ \\text{exp}(\\mathbf{g}(a,c_{i})\\cdot\\mathbf{g}(s_{i},..,s_{i-k}))}{\\sum_{a^{ \\prime}\\in A_{cand}}\\text{exp}(\\mathbf{g}(a^{\\prime},c_{i})\\cdot\\mathbf{g}(s_ {i},..,s_{i-k}))}\\end{split} \\tag{2}\\]\n\nIn the above formula, \"\\(||\\)\" is the string concatenation operator. Section 3.3 will discuss the training algorithm for the ToT controller policy network.\n\n**Prompter Agent**. The prompter agent gives hints to the LLM for it to generate the next search step. The most basic hint can be a generic prompt using the following template: \\(generic\\_tmpl=\\) \"_For the given problem: [problem description], we have come up with a partial solution: [partial solution summary]. Please derive the next step on top of this partial solution, and return the next step in the following JSON format [next_step: <next_step>]_\". Note that the template requires the LLM to respond with a structured JSON string. This is a trick to make it easier for the checker to extract the next step from the LLM response. To create an actual prompt from this template, the prompter needs the [problem description] and the [partial solution summary], both of which can be queried from the memory module.\n\nSimilar to the ToT controller, we can also implement the prompter agent as a policy network, which can generate prompts based on the current partial solution and the conversation history. First we define the prompt template as follows: \\(prompt\\_tmpl=generic\\_tmpl\\mid\\mid\\)_\"Here are a few examples: [in-context learning examples]_.\", where \\(||\\) is the string concatenation operator. The variable _[in context learning examples]_ are in-context learning examples for the problem being solved, which can be picked by the prompter policy network from a set of candidates, similar to the PromptPG approach [24]. The rationale is that given the current and recently attempted intermediate solution, some in-context examples might work better than others as hints for the next step. Given the recently visited node sequence \\(s_{i-k}\\), \\(..\\), \\(s_{i-1}\\), \\(s_{i}\\), our goal is to select \\(l\\) examples \\(e_{i}=\\{e_{i}^{1},e_{i}^{2},...,e_{i}^{l}|e_{i}^{j}\\in E_{cand}\\}\\) where \\(E_{cand}\\) is a pool of in-context learning example candidates. The examples are selected according on a policy:\n\n\\[e_{i}^{j}\\sim\\pi_{\\theta}^{p}(e|s_{i},..,s_{i-k}),\\ e_{i}^{j}\\in E _{cand}\\ \\text{for}\\ j=1,2,...,l \\tag{3}\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\pi_{\\theta}^{p}\\) represents the policy network of the prompter agent with parameters \\(\\theta\\). With the set of selected examples, the prompter agent generates a prompt from the template: \\(p_{i}=prompter(prompt\\_tmpl,e_{i},s_{i})\\), which can be fed into the LLM to obtain the next intermediate solution \\(s_{i+1}=LLM(p_{i})\\). The neural network architecture for the prompter's policy network is similar to that of the ToT controller. The only difference is that since the in-context examples are expressed in natural language, instead of FFN, we use an attention model to process them:\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\\mathbf{h}(e)&=\\mathbf{M}_{1}\\cdot \\text{Attention}(e)+\\mathbf{c}_{1}\\\\ \\mathbf{h}(s_{i},..,s_{i-k})&=\\mathbf{M}_{2}\\cdot \\text{Attention}(\\text{PE}(s_{i-k}||..||s_{i-1}||s_{i}))+\\mathbf{c}_{2}\\\\ \\pi_{\\theta}^{p}(e|s_{i},..,s_{i-k})&=\\frac{\\text{ exp}(\\mathbf{h}(e)\\cdot\\mathbf{h}(s_{i},..,s_{i-k}))}{\\sum_{e^{\\prime} \\in E_{cand}}\\text{exp}(\\mathbf{h}(e^{\\prime})\\cdot\\mathbf{h}(s_{i},..,s_{i-k} ))}\\end{split} \\tag{4}\\]\n\nThe prompter policy network can be trained together with the ToT controller using multi-agent reinforcement learning methods. The training algorithm of the prompter's policy network is discussed in Section 3.3.\n\n### ToT System Training\n\nIn the previous sections, we have described the multi-agent ToT framework. This section dives into how we can train the agents, in particular, the policy networks of the ToT controller and the prompter agent. While there are many multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms (MARL) proposed in the literature [29; 30; 31], in this work we adopt a relatively simple approach which uses a modified version of the REINFORCE algorithm [32] to train the policy networks of the ToT controller and the prompter agent directly. The more advanced MARL algorithms will be explored in the future.\n\nFirst, we define a run of the ToT system as the process where a user inputs the problem description, and the ToT system attempts to solve the problem until it thinks the problem is solved, or a pre-specified maximum round of conversations is reached. Next, we define the reward \\(r\\) of a run: if the problem is correctly solved, then \\(r=+1\\). Otherwise, if the system outputs an incorrect solution, or the maximum round of conversations is reached, then \\(r=-1\\).\n\nThe training algorithm is provided in Algorithm 1. The algorithm takes two inputs, the training data set \\(P_{train}\\), and the number of training epochs \\(N\\) (Line 1-2). The two policy networks \\(\\pi_{\\rho}^{t}(a_{i}|s_{i_{i}},..,s_{i-k})\\) and \\(\\pi_{\\rho}^{p}(e_{i}|s_{i_{i}},..,s_{i-k})\\) are randomly initialized (Line 3-4). We train the two policy networks in turns, i.e. training one network with policy gradient while keeping the other fixed (Line 6). To be more specific, when the current \\(epoch\\) is an even number, we select the ToT controller policy \\(\\pi_{\\rho}^{t}\\), and keep the parameters of the prompter agent fixed. Otherwise, we select the prompter agent policy \\(\\pi_{\\rho}^{p}\\) and fix the ToT controller policy. Next, the algorithm updates the parameters of the selected policy network using the policy gradient method (Line 7-9). For each problem in the training data, we attempt to solve it with a ToT system run. Based on the result, we obtain the reward for that run (Line 8). The entire training algorithm runs for \\(N\\) epochs.\n\n```\n1:Input: problem description from the user \\(p_{user}\\), max num of conversation rounds \\(K\\)\n2:procedureSOLVE(\\(p_{user}\\), \\(K\\))\n3:\\(prompt\\leftarrow\\) Prompter(\\(p_{user}\\))\n4:for\\(round\\) = 1, 2,.., \\(K\\)do\n5:\\(response\\leftarrow\\) LLM(\\(prompt\\))\n6:\\(result\\leftarrow\\) Checker(\\(response\\))\n7:if\\(result.\\)isValidFinalSolution() then\n8:return (\\(result.solution\\))\n9:endif\n10: memory.store(\\(result\\))\n11:\\(ctrl\\_signal\\leftarrow\\) ToTController(memory)\n12:\\(prompt\\leftarrow\\) Prompter(memory, \\(ctrl\\_signal\\))\n13:endfor\n14:return (\\(nil\\))\n15:endprocedure\n```\n\n**Algorithm 2** Problem Solving Using the ToT System\n\n### Problem Solving Using the ToT System\n\nAfter the ToT system is trained, we can use it for inference, i.e. problem solving. Algorithm 2 provides the pseudo code for solving problems using the ToT system. It starts with a user inputting description of the problem (Line 1-2). The prompter module then converts the user input into a prompt (Line 3) using a prompt template for user input, for example: \\(user\\_input\\_prompt=\\) \"_For the given problem: [problem description], please derive the first step, and return the step in the following JSON format [next_step: <next_step>]_\".\n\nNext, up to \\(K\\) rounds of conversations with the LLM are conducted for problem solving (Line 4). In each round, the LLM first produces a response for the given prompt (Line 5). Then, the checker analyzes the response, and returns a result (Line 6). The result contains the partial solution extracted from the LLM response, as well as information like whether the checker considers the solution as a valid final solution, a valid intermediate solution, or an invalid partial solution, etc. If the solution is a valid final solution, the algorithm simply returns it (Line 7-9). Otherwise, the result is stored in the memory module (Line 10). Based on the content of the memory module, the ToT controller issues control signals, e.g. backtracking for \\(l\\) levels, to the prompter (Line 11). Finally, based on the control signal, the prompter looks up the relevant information from the memory module, and produce the next prompt for the LLM (Line 12). If no valid final solution is found within \\(K\\) rounds of conversations, the algorithm return \\(nil\\) indicating it fails to solve the problem (Line 14).\n\n## 4 Evaluation\n\nThis section provides the evaluation methodology and experimental results for our proposed ToT framework. Our evaluation focuses on the ToT-based solver for the Sudoku problem. At the first glance, Sudoku problems seem to be just brain teasers with little practical importance. However, the generalized Sudoku problem on \\(n^{2}\\times n^{2}\\) grids of \\(n\\times n\\) blocks is known to be NP-complete [33]. If the ToT framework can solve instances of the generalized Sudoku problem (granted that it might takes an exponential number of rounds of conversations), in principle it can handle many other mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. In fact, it is straightforward to re-purpose the implementation described below to solve other puzzles, such as 3SAT, 3-coloring, etc. Below we first describe the implementation details of the solver. Then, we present the test suite used in our evaluation, as well as the experimental results.\n\n### ToT Solver for Sudoku Puzzles\n\nThe ToT-based Sudoku solver follows the generic framework described in Section 3 with some specific tweaks for the Sudoku problem. It allows a user to input a Sudoku puzzle using natural languages, for example: \"Please solve this 4x4 Sudoku puzzle [[3,**,2],[1,*,3,*],[*,1,*,3],[4,**,1]] where * represents a cell to be filled\".\n\nWe have implemented the ToT-based Sudoku solver as described in Section 4.1 in Python. We adopted a rule-based approach for the **checker module** since the Sudoku rules are precise and easy to check. The **memory module** stores the conversation history between the prompter and the LLM, as well as a search tree which maintains all the partially filled Sudoku board the LLM has generated so far. This way, when backtracking happens, the previous board configuration can be retrieved. The **ToT controller** in our implementation is also rule-based. It returns to the parent node in the search tree if either the current node considered invalid by the checker, or the search algorithm has explored more than 5 children of the current node. Finally the **prompter agent** uses a variation of the generic template mentioned above, with the _[problem description]_ being the initial configuration of the Sudoku board input by the user, and _[partial solution summary]_ being the partially filled board represented by the current node in the search tree. The LLM utilized in this study is the \"gpt-3.5-turbo\" model, which is accessible through the OpenAI API suite. The _temperature_ parameter was set to 1 in our experiments.\n\n### Experimental Results\n\nWe have implemented four LLM-based Sudoku puzzle solvers and compared their performance: 1) zero-shot solver (**zs**) which directly posts the puzzle description to the LLM, 2) one-shot solver (**os**) which provides a chain-of-thought style step-by-step solution of a 3x3 Sudoku puzzle as an example in addition to the problem description, 3) few-shot solver (**fs**) which provides multiple examples with CoT-style solutions, and 4) our proposed Tree-of-Thought solver (**tot**). We constructed three benchmarks, comprising of ten 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5 Sudoku puzzles, respectively. The objective of a solver is to fill the \\(n\\times n\\) Sudoku grid with digits so that each row and column contain all of the digits from 1 to \\(n\\) (\\(n=3,4,5\\) in our experiments).\n\nFigure 2 compares the success rates of different LLM-based solvers across the three benchmarks. Here the term _success rate_ refers to the fraction of problems in a benchmark set that are successfully solved by a solver. For example, if a solver is able to solve 4 out of 10 problems in the \"3x3 puzzles\" benchmark set, then the success rate of this solver for this benchmark set is 0.4. As expected, the zero-shot solver has the worst performance across all the three set of benchmarks. Adding CoT-style step-by-step examples significantly boosts the success rate, especially for the 3x3 puzzles. This is expected, since one can pretty much rely on \"short-range\" reasoning skills, which is a strength of the\n\nFigure 2: Experimental results comparing the success rate of different LLM-based Sudoku puzzle solvers across three sets of benchmarks.\n\nLLM models, to solve a small-sized 3x3 Sudoku puzzle, especially when CoT-style hints are provided. However, as the puzzle size gets bigger, the success rate of the one-shot and few-shot solver dropped to around 0.5. This is because solving bigger puzzles requires trial and error, which is a capability LLMs generally lack of as discussed earlier.\n\nIn comparison, the ToT-based solver demonstrates superior performance when compared to the other solvers. For the 3x3 benchmark set, it was able to solve all the puzzles. The success rate improves by 11% compared to the second best for the two benchmark sets. For the 4x4 benchmark set, the ToT-based solver failed to find the solution for 1 out of the 10 puzzles before reaching the maximum round of conversations (which is set to 100 in our experiments). We suspect it is due to the limited capability of the rule-based ToT controller. In particular, the rule-based controller has no sense of whether the current partially-filled board can be completed without violating the Sudoku rules, which decreases the efficiency of the solution search. We expect a neural network based ToT controller will perform better, which we will verify in the future extension of this work. Despite this, the success rate of the ToT based solver is still 80% higher compared to that of the one-shot and few-shot based solvers. Finally, for the 5x5 puzzles, the ToT-based solver failed with 2 puzzles before reaching the maximum round of conversations. Nonetheless, the success rate is 60% higher compared to that of the one-shot and few-shot based solvers.\n\n## 5 Discussions and Future Works\n\nIn this paper, we presented the Tree-of-Thought framework, which enhances LLMs with additional agents and memory modules, resulting in improved performance for mathematical problem-solving tasks. To evaluate the performance of this technique, we implemented a Sudoku puzzle solver based on the ToT framework. One of the limitations of the current implementation is that it utilizes a rule-based checker that contains custom logic, making it less easily adaptable to other problems. For more generic problems, for example, general mathematical and logical reasoning problems, where rule-based solution checking is difficult to implement, a future direction is to explore checkers based on neural network or other probabilistic models. Moreover, the experiments we conducted in this work also uses a rule-based ToT controller, which as we pointed out, has limited capabilities. In the future, we will implement the neural network based ToT controller which can hopefully enhance the system performance. Additionally, the policy-gradient based training algorithm proposed in this work is relatively simple and may be susceptible to training stability issues. To further optimize the ToT system, more advanced multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly those designed for cooperative agents, could be adopted.\n\nAnother intriguing future direction is to investigate the potential of utilizing the \"self-play\" technique to enable the ToT system to develop novel problem solving strategies that are not found in the LLM's training text corpus. The self-play training method is a reinforcement learning technique which was popularized by the development of competitive game-playing agents such as AlphaGo and AlphaStar [34; 35; 36], where an AI agent learns to improve its own strategy by playing against itself. Today's LLMs are typically trained using self-supervised learning techniques. They may have limitations when it comes to problem-solving, as they may not be able to generate samples (i.e. novel problem solving strategies) that fall outside the distribution of the training data. In other words, they may not be able to \"think outside the box\", which is a crucial human trait that facilitates the discovery of new knowledge. Compared to self-supervised learning, self-play based reinforcement learning enables the system to access a much broader solution space beyond the provided training examples, allowing for greater improvement. AlphaGo and similar systems have demonstrated the ability to devise strategies that surpass even those of human experts. Inspired by these examples, for ToT system training, instead of relying on the training data set \\(P_{train}\\), we can introduce a \"quizzer\" module which can come up with problem descriptions on its own to train the ToT controller and the prompter agent. It is worth mentioning that one of the key enablers for training AlphaGo and similar system is that the environment reward can be precisely determined, as it is straightforward to determine whether the gameplay results in a win or a loss. The ToT framework incorporates a checker that can assess the correctness of the solution, functioning similarly to the environment, particularly for problems that have well-defined solution validation rules. Thus, the reinforcement learning training methods can be readily applied. We suspect that this self-driven learning approach, similar to the self-play method, could be an effective means of improving the ToT framework's problem-solving capabilities beyond the solution examples provided in the training text corpus for the LLMs.\n\n## References\n\n* [1] Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan N.

One of the major causes of the high generation latency is the\nsequential decoding approach adopted by almost all state-of-the-art LLMs. In\nthis work, motivated by the thinking and writing process of humans, we propose\nSkeleton-of-Thought (SoT), which first guides LLMs to generate the skeleton of\nthe answer, and then conducts parallel API calls or batched decoding to complete the contents of each skeleton point in parallel. Not only does SoT provide\nconsiderable speed-ups across 12 LLMs, but it can also potentially improve the\nanswer quality on several question categories. SoT is an initial attempt at datacentric optimization for inference efficiency, and further underscores the potential\nof pushing LLMs to think more like a human for answer quality.\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nLarge language models (LLMs) (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023a; Du et al., 2022; OpenAI,\n2023; Zheng et al., 2023) have shown exceptional performance in natural language processing and\nchatbot systems. However, the inference process of the state-of-the-art LLMs is slow, hindering their\ninteractive use. For example, it takes 22 seconds for Claude (Anthropic, 2023) (accessed through\nSlack API) and 43 seconds for Vicuna-33B V1.3 (a 33B LLaMA-based model, running locally on\none NVIDIA A100 GPU) to answer the question in Fig. 1.\nWe conclude three major causes of LLMs\u2019 slow inference: (1) A large model size requires a large\namount of memory, memory access, and computation. For example, the FP16 weights of 175B GPT3 take 350GB memory, which means at least 5\u00d780GB A100 GPUs are needed to keep the model\nin GPU memory. Even with enough GPUs, the heavy memory access and computation slow down\nthe inference. (2) The attention operation in the prevailing transformer architecture is I/O bounded\nand has a quadratic memory and computation complexity in sequence length. (3) The sequential\ndecoding approach in inference generates tokens one by one. This approach introduces a significant\n\u2217Equal contribution.\n\u2020 The main updates in arXiv V2 are as follows: (1) Add the quality and efficiency evaluation of SoT on\nGPT-4. (2) Use GPT-4 as the judge for answer quality evaluation. The old results with ChatGPT-3.5 as the\njudge are moved to App. I.3. (3) Add the SoT with Router (SoT-R) method (\u00a7 4) which adaptively triggers SoT\non suitable questions. (4) Move detailed answer analysis to the appendices.\n1\narXiv:2307.15337v2  [cs.CL]  8 Oct 2023\n\fSkeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding\nAnswer\n1.

Instead of producing answers sequentially, SoT produces different parts of answers in parallel. In more detail, given the question,\nSoT first prompts the LLM to give out the skeleton, then conducts batched decoding or parallel API\ncalls to expand multiple points in parallel, and finally aggregates the outputs to get the final answer.\nRight: The net win rates and speed-ups of SoT with router (SoT-R) compared to normal generation\non Vicuna-80. The net win rate is the difference between the fraction of questions that SoT-R has\nbetter and worse answers than normal generation. The speed-up is the ratio between the latency\nof normal and SoT-R generation. (1.0, 0.0) represents normal generation. Higher is better on both\naxes. For most models, SoT-R not only accelerates the generation but also improves the quality of\nthe answers (evaluated with FastChat metric (Zheng et al., 2023)). See \u00a7 3.2 and 4 for more details.\ninference latency since the generation of tokens cannot be parallelized. There is a bunch of literature\naddressing the first two axes: large model size (Xiao et al., 2022; Frantar et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2023;\nSheng et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2021) and attention operation (Kitaev et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020;\nDao et al., 2022; Zaheer et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2023b). These works either compress/redesign the\nmodel (Xiao et al., 2022; Frantar et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2023; Kitaev et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020;\nDao et al., 2022; Zaheer et al., 2020) or redesign the serving system (Sheng et al., 2023; Chen et al.,\n2023b) and hardware (Wang et al., 2021).\nIn contrast to prior work, we tackle the third axis and question the common assumption that LLMs\nhave to do fully sequential decoding. We show the feasibility of parallel decoding of off-the-shelf\nLLMs without any changes to their model, system, or hardware. For instance, for the question\nin Fig. 1, we can reduce the latency from 22 seconds to 12 seconds (1.83\u00d7 speed-up) with Claude,\nand from 43 seconds to 16 seconds (2.69\u00d7 speed-up) with Vicuna-33B V1.3 on an NVIDIA A100.\nThe idea stems from reflecting on how humans ourselves answer questions. Humans do not always\nthink about questions and write answers in a sequential fashion. In contrast, for many question\ntypes, we first derive the skeleton according to some protocols and strategies, and then add evidence\nand details to refine and explicate each point. This is especially the case on formal occasions like\noffering consultancy, taking tests, writing papers, and so on. Can we make LLMs think in the same\nway? To this end, we propose Skeleton-of-Thought (SoT). Specifically, as shown in Fig. 1, we guide\nthe LLM to derive a skeleton first by itself. Based on the skeleton, the LLMs can complete each\npoint in parallel so that we get a speed-up. SoT can be utilized to accelerate both open-source\nmodels with batched decoding and API-based models with parallel API calls.\nTo make the overall solution more practical, we also design an extension, SoT with router (SoT-R),\nwhich employs a router to only trigger SoT for suitable questions.\nWe test SoT on 12 recently released LLMs. Not only does SoT provide considerable speed-ups (up\nto 2.39\u00d7), but it can also improve the answer quality in many cases (Fig. 1).\nNote that in contrast to existing model- and system-level efforts for inference efficiency, SoT takes\na novel \u201cdata-level\u201d pathway by letting the LLM organize its output content. This novel perspective\nis becoming feasible and is expected to grow in relevance, owing to the evolving capabilities of\nstate-of-the-art LLMs. We hope this work can stimulate more research in the realm of data-centric\noptimization (Zha et al., 2023; HazyResearch, 2023) for efficiency.\n2\n\fSkeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding\nPrompt 1.

Finally, we analyze the limitations and share outlooks of SoT in \u00a7 6.\n2\nSKELETON-OF-THOUGHT (SOT)\n2.1\nMETHOD\nOverview. Based on the intuition that humans usually think about and answer a question in an\norganized way, the core idea of this work is to guide the LLM itself to give a skeleton first and then\nwrite the overall answer parallelly instead of sequentially. Fig. 1 illustrates how SoT produces the\nfinal answer to a user question q.\n(1) Skeleton stage. SoT first assembles a skeleton request, T s(question = q), using the skeleton\nprompt template T s (Prompt 1, and Prompt 3 in App. B.1) with the question q as the parameter. The\nskeleton prompt template is written to guide the LLM to output a concise skeleton of the answer.\nThen, we extract the B points from the skeleton response Rs of the LLM.\n(2) Point-expanding stage. Based on the skeleton, we let the LLM expand on each point in parallel.\nSpecifically, for the point with index b and skeleton Rs\nb, SoT uses T pe(question = q, skeleton =\nRs, point index = b, point skeleton = Rs\nb) as the point-expanding request for the LLM, where\nT pe is the point-expanding prompt template (Prompt 2). Finally, after completing all points, we\nconcatenate the point-expanding responses {Rpe\nb }b=1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,B to get the final answer.\nParallel point expanding. We conduct parallel point-expanding so that SoT is able to achieve a\nspeed-up than normal decoding.\n(1) For proprietary models with only API access, we can issue multiple parallel API calls to get an\nend-to-end latency gain at the cost of an increased number of API requests and tokens.\n(2) For open-source models that we can run locally, we let them process the point-expanding requests as a batch (paddings are added to the left of the point-expanding requests). We explain below\nwhy this could achieve speed-ups. A typical LLM generative process consists of two phases: (a)\nthe prefilling phase in which the prompt is parsed to generate the key-value cache for further use,\nand (b) the decoding phase in which tokens are generated one by one in a sequential manner. The\ndecoding phase accounts for the majority of the end-to-end latency, especially when generating a\nlong response. Note that the decoding phase is bottlenecked by weight loading instead of activation\n3\n\fSkeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding\nloading or computation.1 Consequently, running LLM inference with increased batch sizes does not\nincrease the per-token latency much. Therefore, SoT allows us to decode roughly B\u00d7 more tokens\nwithin the same amount of time if we parallelly decode B points. See App. E for the expanded\ndiscussions and the supporting experiments.\nPlease refer to App. B for more implementation details of SoT.\n3\nSOT EVALUATION\nDatasets. We evaluate SoT on two recent assistant-style datasets: (1) Vicuna-80 (Chiang et al.,\n2023), which contains 80 questions spanning nine categories, such as coding, math, writing, roleplay, and so on, and (2) WizardLM (Xu et al., 2023), which contains 218 questions spanning more\ncategories and diverse difficulties. Due to space constraints, we only report Vicuna-80 results in the\nmain paper, and defer WizardLM results to the Apps. G and I.\nModels. We test SoT on 12 recently released models, including 9 open-source models and 3 APIbased models (Table 1). We obtain the weights of all the open-source models from Hugging Face.\nSee App. A for more details.\n3.1\nEVALUATION OF EFFICIENCY\nAPI-based\nmodels.\nWe\nrecord\nthe\nlatency\nof\nevery\nAPI\ncall\nwith\nstart = time.time(); ...; elapsed_time = time.time() - start,\nand\nadd the latency of the skeleton API call and the slowest point-expanding API call as the SoT latency.\nOpen-source models. All open-source models we currently evaluate are based on the LLaMA 7B,\n13B, or 33B architectures. Thus, to enable fast analysis, we first make a latency profiling table for\neach LLaMA architecture on NVIDIA A100. The table contains the architecture\u2019s (1) latency for\nprefilling sequences of length 1 to 700 with different batch sizes (from 1 to 16), and (2) decoding\none token with a context of length 1 to 1024 with different batch sizes (from 1 to 16). With these\nthree latency profiling tables, given the number of points B, the token lengths of the requests and\nresponses in the skeleton and point-expanding stages, we can quickly estimate the SoT latency\nby simply looking up entries in the tables and adding them up. See App. F for a more detailed\ndescription of how we conduct the profiling and estimate the latency.\nIn addition to the above approach, we also compare the actual latency of SoT and normal sequential\ngeneration (abbreviated as \u201cnormal\u201d in the following discussion) in App. G.1.4.\nThe rest of this section shows the speed-ups of SoT on different models (\u00a7 3.1.1) and question\ncategories (\u00a7 3.1.2). In addition, we also report the latency breakdown of SoT stages in App. G.1.2\nand the SoT speed-ups on an RTX 3090 GPU in App. G.1.3.\n3.1.1\nSPEED-UP BREAKDOWN: MODELS\nWe investigate how SoT reduces the end-to-end latency on different models. Fig. 2a shows the\naverage speed-up for each model across all question categories. We can see that SoT obtains a >2\u00d7\nspeed-up (up to 2.39\u00d7) on 8 out of 12 models.\nWe report the detailed statistics about token lengths and numbers of points in Fig. 11. (1) In terms\nof the point number B (Fig. 11a), LLaMA2, Vicuna-7B V1.1, Vicuna-7B V1.3, and ChatGPT-3.5\nyield relatively fewer points (<6), while GPT-4 and StableVicuna-13B generates the largest number\nof points on average (\u22489). (2) Regarding the point-expanding response length, Figs. 11b to 11d\nshow that the API-based models, ChatGPT-3.5, Claude, and GPT-4, follow the point-expanding\nrequest better and generate shorter point-expanding responses than the open-source models. One\ncan also notice that StableVicuna-13B\u2019s longest point-expanding responses for many question categories can be as lengthy as the overall normal answer, since it fails to adhere to the \u201cWrite it\n**very shortly**\u201d instruction in the point-expanding request. Consequently, SoT cannot accelerate\nStableVicuna-13B well. (3) Regarding the length balance degree between point responses, Fig. 11e\nshows that LLaMA2 and the API-based models generate more balanced point-expanding responses.\n1This is true when the number of concurrent queries is small; see \u00a7 6 for discussion on other scenarios.\n4\n\fSkeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding\n(4) As for the overall length of the final aggregated answer (Fig. 11f), employing SoT on most\nmodels results in answers that are, on average, 1\u223c2\u00d7 longer than the normal answer.\n1.0\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1.8\n2.0\n2.2\n2.4\n2.6\n2.8\nStableVicuna-13B\nClaude\nVicuna-13B V1.3\nChatGPT-3.5\nGPT-4\nVicuna-7B V1.3\nUltraLM-13B\nVicuna-33B V1.3\nOpenChat-13B\nVicuna-7B V1.1\nLLaMA2-Chat-13B\nLLaMA2-Chat-7B\n1.13\u00d7\n1.31\u00d7\n1.91\u00d7\n1.97\u00d7\n2.00\u00d7\n2.01\u00d7\n2.18\u00d7\n2.24\u00d7\n2.28\u00d7\n2.30\u00d7\n2.38\u00d7\n2.39\u00d7\n(a) Different models.\n1.0\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1.8\n2.0\n2.2\n2.4\n2.6\n2.8\nmath\nfermi\ncounterfactual\nroleplay\ncoding\ncommon-sense\nwriting\ngeneric\nknowledge\n1.34\u00d7\n1.69\u00d7\n1.89\u00d7\n1.95\u00d7\n2.06\u00d7\n2.24\u00d7\n2.26\u00d7\n2.31\u00d7\n2.33\u00d7\n(b) Different categories.\nFigure 2: Average speed-ups of SoT on different models and question categories.\n3.1.2\nSPEED-UP BREAKDOWN: QUESTION CATEGORIES\nHere we investigate how SoT reduces the end-to-end latency for different question categories.\nFig. 2b shows the average speed-up for each question category across all models. The question\ncategories for which SoT can provide high-quality answers are marked in green, and other categories are marked in red (see \u00a7 3.2.3 for the answer quality evaluation). We can see that SoT can\nobtain speed-ups for all question categories. For the five question categories that SoT can provide\nhigh-quality answers (i.e., knowledge, generic, common-sense, roleplay, counterfactual), SoT can\nspeed up the overall answer generation process by 1.89\u00d7 to 2.33\u00d7 in the meantime.\n3.2\nEVALUATION OF ANSWER QUALITY\nIn order to compare the answer quality of the normal sequential generation (abbreviated as \u201cnormal\u201d\nin the following discussion) and SoT generation, we adopt two LLM-based evaluation frameworks:\nFastChat (Zheng et al., 2023) and LLMZoo (Chen et al., 2023c). The evaluation process is to present\na question and a pair of answers (from normal or SoT generation) to an LLM judge (GPT-4 in the\nmain paper; see App. I.3 for the results evaluated using ChatGPT-3.5) and ask for its preference.\nThe response can be that SoT\u2019s answer wins/ties/loses compared to the normal answer.\nHere are more details about the evaluation of the answer quality:\n(1) Detailed metrics. FastChat evaluation provides one metric for the general quality of the answers.\nIn addition to a general metric, LLMZoo provides five detailed metrics on the answers\u2019 coherence,\ndiversity, immersion, integrity, and relevance.\n(2) Question categories. FastChat provides two special evaluation prompts for coding and math\nquestions for more accurate evaluation, whereas LLMZoo does not. Following the implementation\nin LLMZoo, we exclude math and coding questions in all LLMZoo evaluation results.\n(3) Extentions to avoid evaluation bias. To avoid the potential bias from the order of the two answers\npresented to the LLM judge, we extend FastChat and LLMZoo evaluation frameworks by running\nthe evaluation twice with either ordering of the two answers. In either evaluation, a score of 1,\n0, and -1 is assigned when SoT wins, ties, or loses, respectively. The final evaluation is that SoT\nwins/ties/loses when the sum of the two scores is positive/zero/negative. For example, if SoT wins\nin one evaluation and loses in the other evaluation, the result is \u201ctie\u201d. If SoT wins (loses) in one\nevaluation and ties in the other, the result is \u201cwin\u201d (\u201close\u201d).\n(4) Net win rates. We further define net win rates to give a summarized view of the answer quality.\nGiven the number of questions that SoT wins (#win) and loses (#lose), we define net win rates\nas #win\u2212#lose/total number of questions. 0% means that SoT performs competitively to the normal baseline\n(wins and loses in the same number of questions). Higher values mean that SoT performs better.\nThe organization of this section on answer quality evaluation is as follows. We first present the overall quality of SoT answers (\u00a7 3.2.1), and then go into the details across different question categories\n(\u00a7 3.2.3), models (\u00a7 3.2.2), and metrics (\u00a7 3.2.4).\n5\n\fSkeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding\n3.2.1\nOVERALL QUALITY\nIn Fig. 3, we show the win/tie/lose rates (the percentage of the cases when SoT wins/ties/loses\ncompared to normal generation) across all models and questions using the two metrics from FastChat\nand LLMZoo that capture the general quality of the answers. We notice a discrepancy between the\ntwo metrics on when SoT is strictly better than the baseline (45.8% v.s. 29.5%). Despite that, the\ntwo metrics agree that SoT is not worse than the baseline in around 60% of the cases, and the win\nrates are close to the lose rates. This result suggests that the answers of SoT maintain good quality\nof that of the normal generation.\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\nGeneral quality (LLMZoo)\nGeneral quality (FastChat)\n45.8%\n29.5%\n19.6%\n29.3%\n34.5%\n41.2%\nWin\nTie\nLose\nFigure 3: Win/tie/lose rates of SoT v.s. normal generation using \u201cgeneral\u201d metrics from FastChat\nand LLMZoo. SoT performs better than or equal to normal generation in around 60% cases.\n3.2.2\nQUALITY BREAKDOWN: MODELS\nNext, we investigate how SoT performs on different models. We compute net win rates on all\nmodels in Fig. 4. Again, we see that the two general metrics from FastChat and LLMZoo have\ndifferent absolute values but similar rankings. In particular, both metrics agree that OpenChat-13B,\nVicuna-7B V1.1, Claude, LLaMA2-Chat-13B have low net win rates, whereas Vicuna-13B V1.3,\nStableVicuna-13B, and UltraLM-13B have high net win rates.\n-60%\n-40%\n-20%\n0%\n20%\nStableVicuna-13B\nUltraLM-13B\nVicuna-13B V1.3\nGPT-4\nLLaMA2-Chat-7B\nVicuna-33B V1.3\nVicuna-7B V1.3\nChatGPT-3.5\nLLaMA2-Chat-13B\nOpenChat-13B\nVicuna-7B V1.1\nClaude\n(a) Metric: general quality (FastChat).\n-40%\n-20%\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\nStableVicuna-13B\nUltraLM-13B\nVicuna-13B V1.3\nGPT-4\nLLaMA2-Chat-7B\nVicuna-33B V1.3\nVicuna-7B V1.3\nChatGPT-3.5\nLLaMA2-Chat-13B\nOpenChat-13B\nVicuna-7B V1.1\nClaude\n(b) Metric: general quality (LLMZoo).\nFigure 4: Net win rates of SoT on different models.\nWe investigate the answers in App. I.1.1, and summarize the key takeaways as follows. Some\nmodels have low SoT quality as they cannot understand the skeleton and point-expanding prompts\nwell. Some other models have low SoT quality as their normal answers already have good quality,\nmaking it hard for SoT to beat them (e.g., Claude). For models that are able to understand the\nSoT prompts, the answer quality is improved. We expect that further improving SoT prompts or\nfine-tuning the models can make it easier for LLMs to understand the skeleton and point-expanding\nprompts and ultimately result in better answer quality.\n3.2.3\nQUALITY BREAKDOWN: QUESTION CATEGORIES\nNext, we investigate how SoT performs on different question categories. We compute net win rates\n(win rates minus lose rates) on all question categories in Fig. 5. Similar to Fig. 3, we see that\nLLMZoo tends to be more optimistic about the quality of SoT than FastChat. Nevertheless, the\nconclusions are consistent: SoT performs relatively well on generic, common-sense, knowledge,\nroleplay, and counterfactual. SoT performs relatively poorly on writing, fermi, math, and coding.\nWe investigate the answers in App. I.1.2, and summarize the key takeaways as follows. SoT performs well when the question can be answered in several points whose details can be expanded\nindependently. This includes a wide range of real-world questions. On the other hand, it is fundamentally challenging to apply SoT on questions that require step-by-step thinking, in which the\n6\n\fSkeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding\n-80%\n-60%\n-40%\n-20%\n0%\n20%\n40%\ncounterfactual\ngeneric\ncommon-sense\nknowledge\nroleplay\nfermi\nwriting\nmath\ncoding\n(a) Metric: general quality (FastChat).\n-20%\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\ncounterfactual\ngeneric\ncommon-sense\nknowledge\nroleplay\nfermi\nwriting\n(b) Metric: general quality (LLMZoo).\nFigure 5: Net win rates of SoT on different question categories.\nlatter steps require the details from the earlier steps, such as math questions. To make SoT general\nacross broader question categories, one promising pathway is to enable SoT to adaptively fall back\nto normal generation, which we explore in \u00a7 4. Interestingly, our results suggest that some LLMs\nare already able to do that occasionally without special prompting or tuning (see App. I.1.2).\n3.2.4\nQUALITY BREAKDOWN: METRICS\nAll previous evaluations use metrics about the general quality of the answer. In Fig. 6, we show\nmore detailed metrics from LLMZoo to reveal in which aspects SoT can improve or hurt the answer\nquality. On average, we can see that SoT improves the diversity and relevance while hurting the\nimmersion and coherence.\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\nIntegrity\nCoherence\nImmersion\nRelevance\nDiversity\n23.2%\n29.8%\n40.5%\n61.4%\n99.9%\n34.6%\n30.6%\n23.7%\n11.3%\n0.1%\n42.1%\n39.6%\n35.8%\n27.3%\nWin\nTie\nLose\nFigure 6: Win/tie/lose rates of SoT v.s. normal generations using metrics from LLMZoo. SoT\nperforms well on diversity and relevance, and relatively worse on coherence and immersion.\nThrough answer investigation (App. I.1.3), we summarize the key takeaways as follows. The skeleton stage of SoT explicitly require LLMs to discuss the answers from multiple aspects without filler\nwords. This improves the diversity and relevance of the answers. As for coherence and immersion,\nSoT is not worse than the normal generation around 60% of the time. One future direction is to\nimprove the SoT prompts or pipeline so that the answers can be better in more metrics.\n4\nSOT WITH ROUTER (SOT-R): ADAPATIVELY TRIGGERING SOT\nIn \u00a7 3, we see that SoT provides considerable speed-ups while maintaining (or even improving)\nanswer quality for many question types. However, the biggest limitation is that SoT is not suitable\nfor questions that require step-by-step reasoning (\u00a7 3.2.3). Towards pushing the practical adoption\nof SoT, we explore the possibility of adaptively triggering SoT only when it is suitable. To achieve\nthat, we propose a router module that decides if SoT should be applied for the user request, and\nthen call either SoT or normal decoding accordingly. This paradigm aligns with the recent trends\nof composing multiple models to solve complicated tasks (Chase, 2022; Shen et al., 2023). To\nimplement the router, we explore two options: LLM prompting as the router (no model training is\nneeded) (\u00a7 4.1), and trained RoBERTa as the router (\u00a7 4.2). The evaluation is provided in \u00a7 4.3.\n4.1\nPROMPTING ROUTER\nWe directly ask an LLM if the question is suitable for SoT. More specifically, we ask the LLM if the\ndesired answer is in a list of independent points (see App. C.1 for the prompt). If the answer is yes,\n7\n\fSkeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding\nwe will use SoT; otherwise, we will use normal generation (i.e., directly feeding the question to the\nLLM). We employ GPT-4 as the LLM router given its strong capability.\n4.2\nTRAINED ROUTER\nWhile leveraging GPT-4 as the router obviates the need for model training, its performance remains\nsensitive to prompt design. Therefore, we approach the problem as a sequence classification task by\nfine-tuning a small language model as the router. Specifically, we annotate the LIMA dataset (Zhou\net al., 2023) as the training set to train a RoBERTa model (Liu et al., 2019), which has only 120M\nparameters. Comprehensive details regarding the annotation and training processes can be found in\nApps. C.2.1 and C.2.2, respectively.\n4.3\nSOT-R EVALUATION\nWe compare SoT and SoT-R under the same evaluation setup in \u00a7 3. Besides the prompting and\ntrained routers, we also consider a \u201chuman router\u201d where we manually judge whether SoT should\nbe applied for each question. This serves as a benchmark for comparison.\n4.3.1\nEVALUATION OF EFFICIENCY\nFig. 7 shows the speed-ups of SoT and SoT-R for different models on the Vicuna-80 dataset (see\nApp. G.2 for more results on the WizardLM dataset). We can see that: (1) As expected, SoT-R\nobtains lower speed-ups than SoT, since SoT is not triggered for some questions and the router\ninduces a small latency overhead. Nevertheless, SoT-R can still benefit most models with >1\u00d7\nspeed-ups. (2) SoT-R with the trained router obtains slightly higher speed-ups for 7 out of 12 models\non Vicuna-80, while SoT-R with the prompting router obtains higher speed-ups for all models on\nthe WizardLM dataset (see Fig. 17 in App. G.2).\n1.00\n1.25\n1.50\n1.75\n2.00\n2.25\n2.50\n2.75\nStableVicuna-13B\nClaude\nVicuna-13B V1.3\nChatGPT-3.5\nGPT-4\nVicuna-7B V1.3\nUltraLM-13B\nVicuna-33B V1.3\nOpenChat-13B\nVicuna-7B V1.1\nLLaMA2-Chat-13B\nLLaMA2-Chat-7B\nSoT (w/o router)\nSoT-R w/ prompting router\nSoT-R w/ trained router\nFigure 7: Speed-ups of SoT and SoT-R on different models across all question categories of\nthe Vicuna-80 dataset.\n-80%\n-60%\n-40%\n-20%\n0%\n20%\n40%\ncounterfactual\ngeneric\ncommon-sense\nknowledge\nroleplay\nfermi\nwriting\nmath\ncoding\nSoT (w/o router)\nSoT-R w/ prompting router\nSoT-R w/ trained router\nSoT-R w/ human router\nFigure 8: Net win rates of SoT and SoT-R on\ndifferent question categories of the Vicuna-80\ndataset (evaluated with the FastChat metrics).\n4.3.2\nEVALUATION OF ANSWER QUALITY\nFig. 8 shows the net win rates (averaged across all models) of SoT and SoT-R on Vicuna-80 with the\nFastChat metrics (see App. I.2 for results of the WizardLM dataset and LLMZoo metrics). We can\nsee that: (1) SoT-R significantly improves the answer quality on questions where SoT is not suitable\n(e.g., coding, math, writing, fermi) by falling back to normal decoding. At the same time, SoT-R\nmaintains answer quality improvements on questions where SoT is good at. (2) The trained router\nperforms similar to (on Vicuna-80) or better than (on WizardLM; see App. I.2) the prompting router.\nThis accords with our intuition in \u00a7 4.2. (3) The prompting and trained routers could even surpass\nhuman router (e.g., on roleplay questions; see more examples on WizardLM in App. I.2).\nWe discuss the consistency across three routers in App. C.3. The primary takeaways include: (1)\non Vicuna-80, there is a notable consistency among all three routers, and (2) on WizardLM, greater\ndiscrepancies emerge, with the trained router showing higher alignment with human annotations.\n5\nRELATED WORK\nThis section positions SoT in related work to reveal how SoT (1) is connected to, (2) is different\nfrom, and (3) can harness the power of other methods. See App. D for the expanded discussion.\nEfficient LLM methods at model and system levels. At the model level, prior work proposes efficient architectures, including dynamic mixture-of-experts (Lepikhin et al., 2021), low-complexity\n8\n\fSkeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding\nattention (Kitaev et al., 2020), and multi-query attention (Shazeer, 2019). However, they usually\nrequire a significant re-training cost. In contrast, compression methods require a smaller amount\nof fine-tuning cost by reducing the complexity of pre-trained LLMs, such as quantization (Frantar\net al., 2022) and weight or activation sparsification (Mishra et al., 2021; Zaheer et al., 2020).\nAt the system level, prior work (1) optimizes the computational graph (Dao et al., 2022), (2) optimizes the assignment and scheduling of computational graph on devices (Sheng et al., 2023), or\n(3) designs batching or caching mechanisms for serving multiple users (Fang et al., 2021). These\ntechniques address the large memory access and footprint posed by the vast model scale and attention mechanism, and mainly aim at enhancing the throughput rather than the end-to-end latency.\nAs SoT trades off throughput for end-to-end latency, SoT can make these throughput-oriented techniques help with end-to-end latency. This interesting synergy offers opportunities for achieving\nbetter trade-offs between latency and throughput in future serving systems.\nIn contrast to model- and system-level techniques, SoT is a data-level technique in a new \u201ccontent\nco-organization for efficiency\u201d paradigm. See \u00a7 6 for more discussions.\nEfficient LLM methods through parallel generation. Some prior work also addresses the sequential decoding issues. Speculative decoding (SD) methods (Stern et al., 2018) employ smaller models\nto generate some consecutive tokens sequentially and apply the target LLMs to verify them parallelly. Non-autoregressive generation (NAG) methods (Gu et al., 2018; Xiao et al., 2023) sample and\nrefine consecutive tokens parallelly, often with the support of a modified and tuned model.\nRelying on either assisting models or special models and sampling schemes, SD and NAG methods\nconduct parallel verification or sampling and refinement of consecutive tokens. In contrast, SoT\nprompts the LLM itself to plan the contents in a way that permits the parallel generation of tokens in\ndifferent segments, by exploiting the emerging instruction-following and planning ability of LLMs.\nPrompting methods for LLMs. Recent years have witnessed the emergence of the \u201cpre-train,\nprompt, and predict\u201d paradigm, which has shown promise in enhancing LLMs\u2019 quality in math and\ncommonsense reasoning (Wei et al., 2022; Kojima et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2022)\nand planning for multi-modality tasks (Shen et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023). Instead of focusing on\nanswer quality, SoT is a first attempt at exploiting the power of prompting to improve efficiency.\n6\nLIMITATIONS, FUTURE WORK, AND OPEN QUESTIONS\nAnswer quality evaluation. Our answer quality evaluation is far from perfect due to the limited\nprompt set, the potential bias of GPT-4 judges, and the inherent difficulty of evaluating LLM generations. Currently, we did not conduct human evaluation since it is easy for a human to tell whether\nan answer is generated with SoT due to its distinctive pattern, which might cause evaluation bias.\nWe leave a more thorough evaluation of answer quality to future work.\nEliciting or improving LLMs\u2019 ability. \u00a7 3.2.4 demonstrates SoT\u2019s potential of enhancing answer\nquality. It is part of a broader trend in recent research, exemplified by work including CoT (Kojima\net al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022), ToT (Yao et al., 2023), and ReAct (Yao et al., 2022), which collectively\naffirm the notion that explicitly articulating the thought process in language can elicit high-quality\nanswers from LLMs. These findings resemble human thinking: rather than relying solely on the\nfirst intuition or purely sequential thinking, we often document step-by-step reasoning or thought\norganization to attain high-quality answers. This intriguing parallel prompts us to explore further\nhow we can draw from the human thinking process to facilitate more effective and efficient AI.\nFor instance, SoT currently ignores the dependencies between points. A conceptually better way is\nto organize the points as Graph-of-Thoughts, where the edges represent the dependencies, and each\npoint is decoded conditioned on the contents of its ancestor points. In addition, instead of complying\nwith a static graph, we expect the need of having dynamic Graph-of-Thoughts, where the high-level\nthought structure is adjusted dynamically by LLMs themselves. This could potentially combine the\nefficiency and global thinking advantages of SoT with the logical reasoning and impromptu thinking\nstrengths of methods like CoT (Kojima et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022). Notably, a contemporary\nwork (Besta et al., 2023) has attempted to design Graph-of-Thoughts to elicit reasoning.\nFurthermore, there exist self-improving training pipelines (Zelikman et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2022)\nthat use rationales generated by CoT to fine-tune LLMs, thereby enhancing their reasoning abilities.\n9\n\fSkeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding\nLikewise, it is interesting to investigate how the more structured answers from SoT can be used to\nfine-tune LLMs to enhance their ability to generate well-organized and comprehensive answers.\nEfficiency and overhead of SoT in different scenarios. Serving systems commonly adopt batch\nprocessing to handle concurrent queries. This raises a concern of whether SoT may hurt serving\nthroughput due to parallel requests. (1) When there is an unsaturated number of concurrent queries,\nSoT can effectively reduce latency and enhance GPU utilization. Example scenarios include (a)\nEdge-side applications with a single user; (b) Centralized services during periods with unsaturated\nuser requests and underutilized computing capacity. It is interesting to study the appropriate SoT\ntriggering conditions based on system workloads. (2) When there is a saturated number of concurrent queries, SoT is still useful for improving answer quality. However, in this case, it is important\nto consider the computation overhead from SoT. We delve into this concern in App. H.\nFor API-based models, a notable concern arises regarding the increased number of prefilling tokens\n(App. H). Given that many APIs charge token usage, SoT may lead to higher costs. To address this,\none can tune the number of parallel API requests (by expanding multiple points in a single API call),\nor use prompt tuning to design shorter SoT prompts (see App. H).\nData-centric efficiency optimization. While data-centric engineering for improving answer quality (Zha et al., 2023; HazyResearch, 2023) is gaining popularity, its potential for inference efficiency\nis not explored yet. SoT is the first attempt. As LLM capabilities and the amount of LLM-generated\ndata are growing rapidly, data-centric techniques could become more useful in the future. We look\nforward to more explorations to unlock the full potential of data-centric efficiency optimization.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank Sergey Yekhanin (Microsoft Research), and Tianji Wu (Infinigence AI) for their support\nand suggestions on the work.

In order to make the output skeleton short and in a consistent format for\nthe good of efficiency and ease of point extraction, the skeleton prompt template (1) describes the\ntask precisely, and (2) provides a partial answer \u201c1.\u201d for the LLM to continue writing. The skeleton\n2For\nconvenience,\nwe\nuse\nthe\nnon-official\nendpoint\nTheBloke/stable-vicuna-13B-HF\nand\nTheBloke/UltraLM-13B-fp16 to get merged weights.\n3https://www.anthropic.com/claude-in-slack\n4https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service\n18\n\fSkeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding\nPrompt 3. Skeleton Prompt Template T s (with Two-Shot Demonstrations)\n[User:] You\u2019re an organizer responsible for only giving the skeleton (not the full content) for answering the question.\nProvide the skeleton in a list of points (numbered 1., 2., 3., etc.) to answer the question. Instead of writing a full\nsentence, each skeleton point should be very short with only 3\u223c5 words. Generally, the skeleton should have 3\u223c10\npoints.\nQuestion:\nWhat are the typical types of Chinese dishes?\nSkeleton:\n1. Dumplings.\n2. Noodles.\n3. Dim Sum.\n4. Hot Pot.\n5. Wonton.\n6. Ma Po Tofu.\n7. Char Siu.\n8. Fried Rice.\nQuestion:\nWhat are some practical tips for individuals to reduce their carbon emissions?\nSkeleton:\n1. Energy conservation.\n2. Efficient transportation.\n3. Home energy efficiency.\n4. Reduce water consumption.\n5. Sustainable diet.\n6. Sustainable travel.\nNow, please provide the skeleton for the following question.\n{question}\nSkeleton:\n[Assistant:] 1.\nresponses are in the desired format in most cases. Therefore, we can use a simple regular expression\n(\\d+)\\.\\s?([\\s\\S]+?)(?=\\n|\\n*$) to extract point indexes and point skeletons from the\nskeleton response.\nWe find that GPT-4 can work well without the two demonstrations in the skeleton prompt. Therefore,\nwe do not include the two demonstrations for GPT-4 (Prompt 1). For all other models, the two\ndemonstrations are included, as shown in Prompt 3.\nPoint-expanding prompt template. It describes the point-expanding task and provides a partial\nanswer. We also provide instructions \u201cWrite it **very shortly** in 1\u223c2 sentence\u201d so that the LLMs\nkeep the answers concise. Unlike the skeleton prompt template, we find that demonstrations are not\nnecessary to get reasonable results.\nWe find that Claude and GPT-4 follows the instruction \u201cWrite it **very shortly** in 1\u223c2 sentence\nand do not continue with other points!\u201d in Prompt 2 very well, so that the answers are very short.\nTherefore, we delete \u201c**very shortly**\u201d from the prompt template in Claude and GPT-4.\nPartial answer.\nIn the Prompts 1 and 2, we provide partial answers so that LLMs can follow the\ndesired response format better.\nWe can put the partial answer at the end of the prompt for the open-source models to continue\nwriting. An implementation detail is that different open-source models have different conversation templates (i.e., different ways to combine user and assistant messages into one string). For\nexample, Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023) uses the string \u201cUSER:\u201d and \u201c ASSISTANT:\u201d for the placeholder \u201c[User:]\u201d and \u201c[Role]\u201d in the Prompts 1 and 2, respectively, while UltraLM (Ding et al.,\n2023) uses \u201cUser:\u201d and \u201c\u2329/s\u232aAssistant:\u201d. We build our open-source model experiments with the\nhelp of the FastChat codebase (Zheng et al., 2023), in which the conversation templates of many\nmodels are already handled correctly. We implement the conversation templates of OpenChat-13B,\nStableVicuna-13B, and UltraLM-13B according to their official guides and codes.\nFor ChatGPT-3.5, we provide partial answers as a last message in the chat history from the assistant.\nNote that it is not a documented approach. We find it works well in most cases, in that ChatGPT-3.5\n19\n\fSkeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding\nPrompt 4. LLM Prompting as the Router\n[User:] Question: {question}\nHow would you like to answer the question?\nA. Organize the answer as a list of points or perspectives (in the format of 1., 2., 3., etc.), and the points or perspectives\ncan be answered independently without referring to the contents of the previous points.\nB. Organize the answer as a list of points or perspectives (in the format of 1., 2., 3., etc.), and the contents of later points\nor perspectives cannot be answered independently without referring to the contents of the previous ones.\nC. Do not organize the answer as a list of points or perspectives.\nJust say A, B, or C. Do not explain. Do not provide an answer to the question.\n[Assistant:]\ncontinues the texts from the provided partial answer. However, in some rare cases, ChatGPT-3.5\nrepeats the provided partial answers.\nFor Claude over Slack, there is no obvious way to give the API a partial answer. We resort to\nmodifying the prompt template slightly by adding\nPlease start your answer from \u201c{partial answer}\u201d and do not output other things before that\nat the end. We find that Claude understands and obeys it well. For GPT-4, we also take this approach.\nSystem Message.\nWe do not include the system message in the prompts for open-source models\nexcept LLaMA2.\nThe partial answer, \u201c**very shortly**\u201d, and the 2-shot demonstrations discussed above are the only\ndifferences between the prompts we used across all models and all evaluations.\nB.2\nSUPPORTING MULTI-ROUND CONVERSATION\nTo use SoT in a multi-round conversation, we can just put the question and the final aggregated\nanswer in the history, removing all the SoT prompts. In this way, using SoT in one conversation\nround will not introduce additional prefill cost in future rounds.\nC\nIMPLEMENTATION DETAILS OF SKELETON-OF-THOUGHT WITH ROUTER\nC.1\nPROMPTING ROUTER\nWe use Prompt 4 for querying GPT-4 as the router. If the answer is \u201cA\u201d (i.e., the question can be\nanswered in a list of independent points), we will use SoT. Otherwise, if the answer is \u201cB\u201d (i.e., the\nanswer is in a list of points but they depend on each other) or \u201cC\u201d (i.e., the answer should not be in\na list of points), SoT is not suitable and we will fall back to normal decoding.\nC.2\nTRAINED ROUTER\nWe tackle the routing problem as a sequence classification task. We first annotate the LIMA training\nset (Zhou et al., 2023), and then fine-tune a RoBERTa model (Liu et al., 2019) using the labeled\ndata. Finally, we apply the tuned RoBERTa as the router on Vicuna-80 and WizardLM. We detail\nthe steps in the following.\nC.2.1\nANNOTATION PROCESS\nIn the classification task, a label of 1 (positive) indicates that this question can be answered with\nSoT, while a label of 0 (negative) suggests that using the normal generation mode is more suitable.\nWe annotate the LIMA training set, which consists of 1,030 Q&As sourced from three community\nwebpages: Stack Exchange, wikiHow, and the Pushshift Reddit. We also annotate the Vicuna-80\nand WizardLM datasets for evaluation.\n20\n\fSkeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding\nTable 3: Router confusion matrices on the Vicuna-80 dataset.

Specifically, we present each question to GPT-4 and\nanalyze its answer to determine whether SoT can be triggered for this question. We assign a positive\nlabel to a question if GPT-4\u2019s response meets two criteria: (1) it contains a list of points that can be\nexpanded in parallel, (2) each point provides sufficient details (i.e., the point-expanding response is\nnot too short), which will enable SoT to achieve a speed-up. Two of the paper\u2019s authors conduct the\nannotation process independently, and discuss the inconsistent annotations to decide the final label.\nC.2.2\nTRAINING DETAILS\nWe use roberta-base with 120M parameters as the router model. The finetuning is conducted\nusing the AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019) with a weight decay of 0.01. The learning\nrate undergoes a warm-up phase during the first 1% of iterations to 5e-5 and then decays linearly.\nWe train the model for 2 epochs using a batch size of 32. Input sequences are either padded or\ntruncated to achieve a consistent length of 512 tokens.\nIn the application of SoT, false positives (SoT is incorrectly triggered when it should not be, resulting\nin degraded answer quality) are of more significant concern than false negatives (the router misses a\npotential SoT trigger, resulting in a reduced speed-up). Thus, to mitigate false positives, we employ\nthe Tversky loss (Wang et al., 2023b) with parameters \u03b1 = 0.7 and \u03b2 = 0.3, which penalizes false\npositives more heavily than false negatives. We also incorporate label smoothing (Szegedy et al.,\n2016) with a factor of \u03f5 = 0.2. Overall, the entire fine-tuning process is efficient, completing in 2\nminutes on an NVIDIA A100 GPU.\nC.3\nROUTER CONSISTENCY\nWe present the confusion matrices for the three routers to illustrate their consistency. The results on\nVicuna-80 and WizardLM are shown in Tables 3 and 4, respectively.\nOn Vicuna-80, we can observe a notable level of agreement among the three routers. Compared with\nthe GPT-4-prompting router, the trained router exhibits a slightly higher number of false negatives\nw.r.t. the human annotations. Conversely, on WizardLM, given the intricate answer structure and\nthe presence of many ambiguous cases, the routers show significant discrepancies. Specifically, the\nGPT-4 router produces many false positives, which pose adverse affects on the answer quality (see\nApp. I.2). The RoBERTa router aligns more closely with the human annotations.\nC.4\nCONCURRENT EXECUTION FOR SOT-R\nIn SoT-R, the router serves as an additional stage that extends the two-stage SoT pipeline. The\nSoT-R pipeline is illustrated in Fig. 9. To push the limit of latency optimization, we can run the\nrouter, normal generation, and SoT generation concurrently. Once the router makes a decision, one\nof the normal and SoT generation processes can be aborted. However, this approach will increase\n21\n\fSkeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding\nRouter\nSkeleton\nExpand\npositive\nnegative\nDecode\nQuestion\nAnswer\nAnswer\nRouter\nSkeleton\nExpand\nDecode\nQuestion\nAnswer\nAnswer\npositive\nnegative\nFigure 9: Left: The SoT-R pipeline.

Therefore, we did not employ this approach in this work and leave it to future\nwork.\nD\nRELATED WORK (EXPANDED)\nD.1\nEFFICIENT LLMS\nExtensive research has been dedicated to enhancing the throughput and latency of LLM inference. We first discuss model-level architecture design or compression techniques. These techniques\nchange the model and can benefit both the latency and throughput but require finetuning to retain the\nmodel quality. Then, we discuss system-level efforts that optimize the computational graph or the\nassignment and scheduling of the computational graph on computation and storage devices. Most\nsystem-level efforts accelerate the prefilling phase or focus on improving the throughput. Finally,\nwe discuss some research efforts that share a similar motivation to ours, namely, addressing the\nefficiency issue of sequential decoding.\nModel-level optimization.\nConsiderable architectural design efforts have emerged to (1) improve\nthe scalability w.r.t. model size by introducing mixture-of-expert inference (Lepikhin et al., 2021;\nFedus et al., 2022), (2) address the quadratic complexity w.r.t. input size of attention by designing\nnew attention mechanisms (Kitaev et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020), (3) reduce the memory access\nand footprint of attention by using multi-query attention (Shazeer, 2019), and so on. However, these\nmethods usually require a substantial re-training cost. The model compression techniques require a\nsmaller amount of fine-tuning by reducing the model complexity of a pre-trained LLM from certain\naspects (Ganesh et al., 2021). Representative techniques include quantization (Xiao et al., 2022;\nFrantar et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2023), the static or dynamic pruning of weights, activation, and\nattention (Mishra et al., 2021; Zaheer et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2023b), and so on.\nZooming out from LLM compression to the whole field of model compression, we can see that\nmodel co-design or compression for efficiency has received tremendous attention in the past few\nyears and has grown into large research fields, such as pruning (Han et al., 2015; Wen et al., 2016),\nquantization (Krishnamoorthi, 2018), factorization (Denton et al., 2014), and neural architecture\nsearch (Zoph & Le, 2017; Elsken et al., 2019; Cai et al., 2019). Different from the model co-design\nparadigm, SoT is in a \u201ccontent co-organization for efficiency\u201d paradigm for improving the LLM\nefficiency. Along with the growth in the LLM capabilities and amount of LLM-generated data,\ndata-level techniques could become important tools in the efficient LLM toolbox.\nSystem-level optimization.\nIn the realm of lossless acceleration, considerable efforts have been\ndevoted to addressing the I/O-bound nature of LLMs on modern hardware platforms (Dao et al.,\n2022). Numerous studies (Dao et al., 2022; Zhai et al., 2022; Ivanov et al., 2021; NVIDIA, 2019)\nhave focused on adjusting the computational graph by fusing and implementing operations in an\nI/O-friendly way. As a representative method, FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) fuses all operations\nof one attention into one GPU kernel with spatially tiled computation to reduce the off-chip I/O of\nthe attention map. While FlashAttention can effectively accelerate training and the prefilling phase\nof inference, it cannot accelerate the decoding phase much (when the batch size is small), as it is\nthe I/O of weights rather than activation or attention map that bottlenecks the decoding phase. For\nexample, when the context length is 64, decoding one token using LLaMA-7B needs to load each\n22\n\fSkeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding\nof the 7B parameters from the off-chip HBM onto the GPU chip at least once, but only transferring\nabout 20M (0.02B) activation values between the off-chip HBM and GPU chip.\nIn order to satisfy Service Level Objectives, serving systems focus on improving the serving\nthroughput under latency constraints. To this end, serving systems (Fang et al., 2021; NVIDIA,\n2021; Google, 2021) pack multiple queries together into a batch to improve the hardware utilization. The batching technique has proven highly effective in enhancing throughput, leading to the\ndevelopment of various variants. For example, some work designs methods to decide which queries\nto batch together (Fang et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2022), while others selectively batch parts of the\nmodel to enable fine-grained iteration-level batching (Yu et al., 2022) or multi-task batching (Zhou\net al., 2022). Various model parallelism (Lu et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019; Narayanan et al.,\n2019; Rajbhandari et al., 2020; Narayanan et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021; Zheng et al., 2022) and\noffloading (Ren et al., 2021; Sheng et al., 2023) techniques have been proposed to maximize the\nthroughput of LLM training or inference. In a nutshell, given the computational graph and device\nconfigurations, these techniques optimize the split, assignment, and scheduling of computations,\nstorage, and communications on devices. In addition to the model parallelism and batching techniques, an efficient memory management mechanism for LLM workloads is also an essential feature\nin the serving systems (Kwon et al., 2023; SenseTime, 2023a;b).\nTo sum up, these system-level techniques mainly help with the throughput in training and batched\ninference. They can be used by SoT to improve the throughput of the batched decoding of multiple\nsegments. This means that SoT can harness the power of these throughput-oriented techniques and\nmake them help with the end-to-end latency, offering a new dimension for better trading off latency\nand throughput in future serving systems.\nAnother parallelism perspective to position SoT is that SoT guides the LLM to adjust the sequential workload to become \u201cinter-content\u201d parallelizable, which differs from the parallelism levels\nin existing serving systems, including inter-instance (Krizhevsky, 2014; Rajbhandari et al., 2020),\ninter-operation (Huang et al., 2019; Narayanan et al., 2019; 2021), intra-operation (Xu et al., 2021),\nand inter-token (Li et al., 2021). It may be worthwhile to explore the integration of SoT into serving\nsystems to maximize the hardware utilization.\nDecoding optimization.\nOne bottleneck for the end-to-end latency lies in the autoregressive decoding phase, where tokens must be generated one by one. Due to the dependency between tokens,\nthe computation of different tokens cannot be parallelized, causing severe under-utilization of GPU.\nIn order to improve the end-to-end decoding latency of a given LLM, speculative decoding methods (Stern et al., 2018; Leviathan et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023a; Gante, 2023; Sun et al., 2023;\nMiao et al., 2023) propose to use cheaper approaches to generate short candidate token sequences,\nfor example, by sequentially decoding with an assisting model much smaller than the given LLM.\nThen, they use the LLM to parallelly verify the candidates and keep the prefix sequence that matches\nthe LLM\u2019s verification results.\nAnother line of work that shares the motivation of addressing the autoregressive efficiency issue is\nnon-autoregressive generation (NAG) methods (Gu et al., 2018; Xiao et al., 2023). NAG methods\nsample consecutive tokens parallelly, often with the aid of a modified and tuned model. To maintain\nthe answer quality, instead of sampling for one iteration, many NAG methods refine the output\nparallelly for multiple iterations (Xiao et al., 2023; Santilli et al., 2023).\nTo summarize, the speculative decoding methods use assisting models for letting the LLM conduct\nparallel verification of consecutive tokens, and the NAG methods rely on specially designed models,\ntraining schemes, or sampling schemes for the parallel sampling and refinement of consecutive tokens. In contrast, SoT prompts the LLM itself to plan the contents in a way that permits the parallel\ngeneration of multiple tokens in different segments. SoT exploits the emerging instruction-following\nand planning ability of SoTA LLMs rather than relying on specially designed modeling, sampling,\nand training schemes. This is different from all existing work that targets the autoregressive efficiency issue.\nD.2\nPROMPTING METHODS FOR LLMS\nIn recent years, the \u201cpre-train, prompt, and predict\u201d paradigm has emerged (Liu et al., 2023), which\ndesigns prompts comprising task descriptions and (optionally) a few demonstrations to guide pre-\n23\n\fSkeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding\nTable 5: The latency and average GPU performance of the prefilling and decoding phases when\ninferencing LLMs. The prefilling token length is 128, the decoding token length is 64, and the batch\nsize is 1. The test is run on one NVIDIA A100 GPU.\nModel\nPrefill/Decode Latency (ms)\nPrefill/Decode GPU Perf. (TFLOPS)\nLLaMA-7B\n40 / 2735\n43 / 0.31\nLLaMA-13B\n54 / 3725\n62 / 0.44\nLLaMA-33B\n100 / 5506\n85 / 0.75\ntrained LLMs in generating answers for a wide range of downstream tasks. Researchers found that\ninstruction-tuned LLMs (Brown et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2022; Chung et al.,\n2022; Taori et al., 2023) possess a strong ability to (1) generalize to new tasks thanks to the diverse\nnatural language descriptions encountered during instruction tuning, and (2) learn in-context using\na few demonstrations without weight tuning.\nIn virtue of these abilities, the field has been manually engineering (Brown et al., 2020; Kojima\net al., 2022; Shen et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023a), automatic searching (Shin et al., 2020), or continuously tuning (Li & Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021) the prompts for uncovering the capabilities of\nLLMs on downstream tasks. There are a bunch of prompting methods that improves the reasoning\nperformance of LLMs by designing thinking flows mimicking human reasoning: (1) mimicking the\nstep-by-step or compositional thinking structure (Wei et al., 2022; Kojima et al., 2022; Press et al.,\n2022; Yao et al., 2023; Besta et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023), (2) designing multiple reasoning paths\nand their aggregation (Wang et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023c), and (3) using tools for\ncalculation and information retrieval (Chen et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2022; Schick et al., 2023). As\na representative example, the Chain-of-Thought prompts largely improve the performance on tasks\nthat require logical reasoning by simply providing a \u201cLet\u2019s think step by step\u201d (Kojima et al., 2022)\ninstruction or a few demonstrations (Wei et al., 2022). Another topic that arises quite a surge of interests is to prompt LLMs to help finish complex multi-modality task (Shen et al., 2023; Zhu et al.,\n2023). For example, HuggingGPT (Shen et al., 2023) design prompts to guide the LLM to generate\nstructural JSON for the orchestration of multi-model execution to finish complex tasks.\nTo summarize, the large literature on prompting methods has been aiming at uncovering different\ncapabilities of LLM and improving the answer quality on different downstream tasks. In contrast,\nSoT is a first attempt at exploiting the power of prompting to improve efficiency.\nE\nEFFICIENCY ANALYSIS\nThis section gives a detailed explanation on why SoT can reduce the overall decoding latency with\nthe same computational resource for local models.\nThe vanilla approach processes only one question and decodes the answers sequentially, whereas\nSoT processes multiple point-expanding requests and the answers in a batch. We focus on the\nfollowing question: \u201cCompared to processing only one sequence, how much peak memory overhead\nand latency increase will be brought by processing a batch of sequences?\u201d\nA typical LLM generative process consists of two phases: (1) the prefilling phase in which the\nprompt is parsed to generate the key-value cache for further use, and (2) the decoding phase in\nwhich tokens are generated one by one in a sequential manner. The decoding phase accounts for\nthe majority of the end-to-end latency, especially when generating a long response. As shown in\nTable 5, when running Vicuna-7B on NVIDIA A100-80G, the actual computing performance is\nonly 0.31 TFLOPS (0.1% utilization) in the decoding phase, compared to 43 TFLOPS (13.8% utilization) during prefilling. The utilization is calculated with respect to the FP165 tensor core peak\nperformance \u2013 312 TFLOPS for NVIDIA-A100. As a result, the latency of decoding only one token\nis comparable to that of prefilling 128 tokens (40ms). This huge gap in actual computing performance and thereby the latency arises from the fact that all LLM weights need to be loaded onto the\nGPU chip at least once only for decoding one token, so the decoding is heavily bottlenecked by the\nI/O of weights and the GPU computation units cannot be well utilized.\n5All of our experiments are run with FP16 inference.\n24\n\fSkeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\nB\n3000\n3500\n4000\n4500\n5000\n5500\nLLaMA-7B\nLLaMA-13B\nLLaMA-33B\n(a) Latency (ms)\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\nB\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nLLaMA-7B\nLLaMA-13B\nLLaMA-33B\n(b) Actual GPU Perf.

The prefilling token length is 128, and the\ndecoding token length is 64. The test is run on one NVIDIA A100 GPU.\nWhen conducting batched decoding, as the sequence batch size B increases, the latency of decoding\none token for each sequence stays roughly the same (Fig. 10a), as the amount of LLM weights that\nneeds to be loaded onto the chip does not change. As a result, the GPU computation utilization\n( Actual GPU Performance\nPeak GPU Performance ) increases almost linearly as B increases (Fig. 10b). In other words, for generating a final answer of length N, if we cut the answer into B segments of length N/B and decode\nthem as a batch, we can get a B\u00d7 decoding speed-up compared to sequential decoding. Nevertheless, in practice, as prefilling longer requests brings some overhead, and the lengths of the B\nsegments could be imbalanced, the actual speed-up of the batched point-expanding stage compared\nwith the original prefilling and sequential decoding process is smaller than B.\nAs for the peak memory overhead, the amount of LLM weights can be one to two orders of magnitude larger than that of all the intermediate activations as long as the prefilling token length is not\ntoo large, not to mention that most activations do not need to be saved for back-propagation during\ninference. Therefore, the LLM weights account for the majority of the memory footprint in our test\ncases. Consequently, as shown in Fig. 10c, the peak memory overhead due to the increasing size\nof the KV cache and activation grows at a slow pace as the batch size B increases. Thanks to the\nsmall peak memory overhead, in all of our experiments, we managed to use one GPU to run SoT\nwithout seeking help from other peak memory optimization techniques (e.g., quantization (Frantar\net al., 2022; Lin et al., 2023), offloading (Sheng et al., 2023)).\nF\nEFFICIENCY PROFILING\nWe run the profiling on the target GPU (NVIDIA A100-80G and NVIDIA RTX 3090) with CUDA\n11.7, using the Hugging Face transformer library 4.28.1 and PyTorch 2.0.1. The host of A100-80G\nhas an Intel Xeon Platinum 8358P CPU and 1T memory. The host of RTX 3090 has an Intel Xeon\nGold 6246R CPU and 512G memory.\nLatency profiling and estimation.\nFor the decoding phase, we denote tD\nB(k) as the latency\nof batched decoding the k + 1-th token with batch size B, where the superscript D stands for\n\u201cdecode\u201d. For each batch size B = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 16 and each context length k = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 1024, we\nuse torch.cuda.Event to record the latency of decoding one token.\nWe run each decoding three times continuously and take their geometric mean as {tD\nB(k)}k=1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,1024;B=1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,16. For\nthe prefilling phase, we profile the latency of batched prefilling the inputs with token length k in\nrange(1, 700, 10) and batch size B = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 16, and denote it as tP\nB(k), where the superscript P\nstands for \u201cprefill\u201d. We run each test seven times continuously, regard the first two times as the\nwarmup tests, and take the geometric mean of the last five times as {tP\nB(k)}k=1,11,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,691;B=1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,16.\nOnce we get the latency profiling table, given a request with li tokens and the decoding batch size\nB, the latency of generating lo tokens can be estimated as:\nT(li, lo, B) = \u02dctP\nB(li) +\nli+lo\u22121\n\ufffd\nk=li\ntD\nB(k),\n(1)\nwhere the subscripts i and o stand for \u201cinput\u201d and \u201coutput\u201d. Note that we only test the prefilling latency every ten token lengths (i.e., 1, 11, 21, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) for fast profiling and estimate \u02dctP\nB(li) by\ntP\nB(\u230a li\n10\u230b \u00d7 10 + 1).\n25\n\fSkeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding\nThe SoT decoding process consists of two stages: the skeleton stage and the point-expanding stage.\nDenoting the token length of the skeleton request and skeleton response as ls\ni and ls\no, the token length\nof the longest point-expanding request and the longest point-expanding response as lpe\ni\nand lpe\no , the\nnumber of the points as B, we can compute the latency of the skeleton and point-expanding stages\nas:\nLs(ls\ni , ls\no) = T(ls\ni , ls\no, 1),\n(2)\nLpe(lpe\ni , lpe\no , B) = T(lpe\ni , lpe\no , B).\n(3)\nUsing the latency profiling table, we can further estimate the average GPU computing performance\nin FLOPS (i.e., FLOPs per second) of decoding lo tokens with prefilling length li as\nP D(li, lo, B) =\n\ufffdli+lo\u22121\nk=li\nf D\nB (k)\n\ufffdli+lo\u22121\nk=li\ntD\nB(k)\n,\n(4)\nwhere f D\nB (k) denotes the FLOPs of decoding one token with context length k, which is calculated\nby DeepSpeed\u2019s FLOPs profiler 6. Fig. 10b reports the average GPU computing performance during\nthe process of decoding 64 tokens (prefilling length=128), i.e., P D(128, 64, B).\nMemory\nprofiling\nand\nevaluation.\nTo\nevaluate\nthe\npeak\nmemory,\nwe\nuse\ntorch.cuda.max_memory_allocated to record the memory consumption of prefilling sequences of different lengths and decoding with different context lengths and a batch size\nranging from 1 to 16. Then, we calculate the peak memory of each stage as the maximum value of\nthe prefilling and decoding phases, and calculate the overall peak memory of SoT as the maximum\nvalue of the skeleton and point-expanding stages.\n6https://deepspeed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/flops-profiler.html\n26\n\fSkeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding\nG\nEFFICIENCY

Table 6 reports SoT\u2019s prefilling overhead for the\nAPI-based models. These statistics are averaged across the Vicuna-80 questions that are suitable for\nSoT (according to our manual annotation). We can see that SoT significantly increases the number\nof prefilling tokens. This is because that SoT issues an independent point-expanding request for\neach point, with the average number of points being 6.8 on Vicuna-80 dataset across all evaluated\nmodels. Consequently, the APIs need to prefill the point-expanding request multiple times.\n31\n\fSkeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding\nTable 6: SoT\u2019s prefilling token overhead for API-based models.\nModel\nPrefill Phase\nNormal\nSoT Stage 1\nSoT Stage 2\nRatio (SoT / Normal)\nClaude\n12.52\n171.41\n808.91\n78.30\nChatGPT-3.5\n12.52\n171.41\n591.31\n60.92\nGPT-4\n12.52\n171.41\n983.09\n92.21\nWhen using SoT to serve the open-source models, a simple and small trick is to prefill the common\nprefix of point-expanding requests with a batch size of 1 during Stage 2 (i.e., the point-expanding\nstage). Table 7 shows the prefilling overhead after applying the trick. Although the ratio is considerably smaller compared to that of the API-based models, this computational overhead remains a\nconcern, especially during periods of high system workload.\nThere are some possibilities to further reduce the token and computational overhead that are worth\nexploring in future work. To name a few: (1) When using SoT in serving systems, we can simply\nreuse the key-value cache containing the question and skeleton from Stage 1 during Stage 2, rather\nthan re-prefilling them as in a multi-round conversation. (2) Generally, as LLM capabilities continue\nto evolve and prompt tuning techniques advance (Shin et al., 2020; Li & Liang, 2021; Lester et al.,\n2021), the possibility of using much shorter prompts to activate the SoT mode in the future holds\npromise, which would significantly mitigate the token or computational overhead.\nTable 7: SoT\u2019s computational overhead (in terms of the number of prefilling tokens) for open-source\nmodels.\nModel\nPrefill Phase\nNaive\nSoT Stage 1\nSoT Stage 2\nRatio (SoT / Normal)\nLLaMA2-Chat-7B\n12.52\n171.41\n216.49\n30.98\nLLaMA2-Chat-13B\n12.52\n171.41\n216.41\n30.98\nOpenChat-13B\n12.52\n171.41\n234.38\n32.41\nVicuna-7B V1.3\n12.52\n171.41\n211.61\n30.59\nVicuna-13B V1.3\n12.52\n171.41\n273.39\n35.53\nVicuna-33B V1.3\n12.52\n171.41\n258.88\n34.37\nStableVicuna-13B\n12.52\n171.41\n312.03\n38.61\nUltraLM-13B\n12.52\n171.41\n290.88\n36.92\nVicuna-7B V1.1\n12.52\n171.41\n196.64\n29.40\nI\nANSWER QUALITY EVALUATION\nI.1\nSKELETON-OF-THOUGHT\nI.1.1\nANSWER ANALYSIS: DIFFERENT MODELS\nModels on which SoT has low net win rates.

For the weak models such as\nOpenChat-13B and Vicuna-7B V1.1, they are not able to follow the SoT prompts precisely. For\nOpenChat-13B and LLaMA2-Chat-13B, sometimes the skeleton contains undesired contents (e.g.,\ncompleting the skeleton points as shown below).\n32\n\fSkeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding\nQuestion:\nHow many lightning strikes occur on Earth each day?

Introduction.\nLightning is a beautiful and awe-inspiring natural phenomenon, but it can also be dangerous. It occurs when positively\ncharged particles in a thundercloud discharge to the negatively charged Earth. The process is still not fully understood,\nbut scientists have been able to estimate how many lightning strikes occur on Earth each day.\nSkeleton:\n1. The Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nThe Earth\u2019s atmosphere plays a crucial role in the formation of lightning. It consists of different layers, with the troposphere being the lowest and most active. The troposphere is where most of the weather occurs, and it is where lightning\nprimarily forms. The atmosphere\u2019s temperature, humidity, and wind patterns all contribute to the likelihood of a lightning\nstrike.\nSkeleton:\n2. Lightning formation.\nWhen warm, moist air rises, it cools and forms water \u00a1more texts are omitted...\u00bf\nFor both OpenChat-13B and Vicuna-7B V1.1, sometimes they do not write anything in the pointexpanding stage when details are needed.\nQuestion:\nAs a superhero, how would you explain your origin story to a curious child?\nSoT\u2019s answer (Vicuna-7B V1.1) (Orange texts are the skeleton.)\n1.

Protecting the innocent and fighting villains.I use my powers to defend the defenseless and bring justice to those who\nhave been wronged.\n4. Inspired by courage, justice, and selflessness.\nThese two issues result in bad net win rates.\n(2) Claude. For strong models such as Claude, we do not see major issues with SoT\u2019s answers except\nthe common issues across all models discussed in \u00a7 3.2.3. We hypothesize that the low net win rates\nare majorly due to the fact that their normal sequential generation is already very good.\nModels on which SoT has high net win rates. The models with high net win rates (Vicuna-13B\nV1.3, StableVicuna-13B, and UltraLM-13B) are between the above two extremes. On one hand,\nthey are good enough to understand SoT prompts. While we observe that they sometimes have the\nsame issues as OpenChat-13B and Vicuna-7B V1.1 discussed before, these issues happen much less\nfrequently. On the other hand, their normal sequential generation performance has a larger room for\nimprovement than Claude and ChatGPT-3.5 so that the benefits from SoT are more visible on these\nmodels.\nI.1.2\nANSWER ANALYSIS: DIFFERENT QUESTION CATEGORIES\nCategories on which SoT has low net win rates.\n(1) Math. Math questions require step-by-step thinking. Without knowing the previous steps, it is\nhard to derive the following steps. Chain-of-Thoughts (Kojima et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022) emphasize the importance of expanding the sequential thinking steps to solve these problems successfully.\nIn contrast, SoT requires the models to (a) come up with the skeleton of the solution first and (b)\ndeduce each individual step independently without referring to previous results. Both of these are\nchallenging tasks. Strong models are able to get (a) correct but fail at (b). In the following example,\nChatGPT-3.5 gets the skeleton steps correct. However, without knowing the results from the first\nstep, the model starts making mistakes in the second step.7\n7One additional (minor) issue of the API-based ChatGPT-3.5 is that the skeleton point \u201c1.\u201d is repeated in\nthe answer.\n33\n\fSkeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding\nQuestion:\n(Math) Solve for x in the equation 3x + 10 = 5(x - 2).\n\u2717 SoT\u2019s answer (ChatGPT-3.5) (Orange texts are the skeleton.)\n1. Move all x terms to one side. 1. Move all x terms to one side by subtracting 5x from both sides, giving -2x + 10 = -10.\n2. Move all constant terms to the other side. This can be done by subtracting 5x - 10 from both sides, leaving 3x - 5x =\n-10 - 10.\n3. Simplify the equation. Combine like terms on both sides of the equation to get 3x + 10 = 5x - 10.\n4. Divide both sides by the coefficient of x. Divide both sides by 2 to get x = -5.\n5. Check the solution by plugging it back into the original equation.Substitute the value of x obtained in step 4 back into\nthe original equation and verify that both sides are equal.\n\u2713 Normal answer (ChatGPT-3.5)\n3x + 10 = 5(x - 2) can be simplified as follows:\n3x + 10 = 5x - 10 (distribute the 5 on the right side)\n10 + 10 = 5x - 3x (subtract 3x from both sides)\n20 = 2x (combine like terms on the right side)\nx = 10 (divide both sides by 2)\nTherefore, the solution for x in the equation 3x + 10 = 5(x - 2) is x = 10.\nFor weaker models, it is hard to even get step (a) correct. For example, as shown below, the third\nstep \u201cApply FOIL\u201d in Vicuna-13B V1.3\u2019s SoT solution comes out of nowhere. This makes SoT\u2019s\nsolution incorrect (though the solution from the normal generation is also incorrect).\nQuestion:\n(Math) Solve for x in the equation 3x + 10 = 5(x - 2).\n\u2717 SoT\u2019s answer (Vicuna-13B V1.3) (Orange texts are the skeleton.)\n1. Simplify equation.\nWe can simplify the equation by combining like terms:\n3x + 10 = 5(x - 2)\n=\u00bf 3x + 10 = 5x - 10\n=\u00bf x + 5 = 2\n=\u00bf x = 2 - 5\n=\u00bf x = -3\n2. Factor 5(x - 2).\n5(x - 2) = 5x - 10.\n3. Apply FOIL.\n* Multiply the binomials in the equation, using the first term of each binomial for the first term of the product, the outside\nterm for the second term of the product, the second term of each binomial for the third term of the product, and the\nremaining terms for the fourth term of the product.\n* 3(x - 2) + 10 = 5x + 5(-2)\n* 3x - 6 = 5x - 10\n* 3x = 5x - 10\n* x = 5x - 10 / 3\n* x = 5/3x - 10/3\n* x = 2/3x - 5/3\n4. Solve for x.\nAfter applying the FOIL method and simplifying the equation, we get 3x = 17. Therefore, x = 17/3.\n\u2717 Normal answer (Vicuna-13B V1.3)\nTo solve for x in the equation 3x + 10 = 5(x - 2), we need to first distribute the 5 to multiply both sides by 5.\n3x + 10 = 5(x - 2)\n5(3x + 10) = 5(x - 2)\n15x + 50 = 5x - 10\nAdd 5x to both sides:\n20x + 50 = 5x\nSubtract 5x from both sides:\n15x = 0\nDivide both sides by 15:\nx = 0\nTherefore, the solution to the equation is x = 0.\n(2) Fermi. Similar to math questions, questions in the fermi category require solvers to make assumptions and calculate the answer step-by-step. For example, to answer the question in the figure\nbelow, the solver is required to make an assumption about when life began on Earth. In step 4,\nChatGPT-3.5 does not know that it has already assumed 3.5 billion years in step 3 and uses the\nwrong number 4.54 billion in the calculation. In step 5, ChatGPT-3.5 does not know that it has\nalready made the above assumptions and refuses to answer \u201cdue to the uncertainties in estimating\nthe age of the Earth\u201d. In contrast, normal generation is able to create a consistent solution.\n34\n\fSkeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding\nQuestion:\n(Fermi) How many times has the Earth orbited the Sun since the beginning of life? Try\nto explain your answer. Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step.\n\u2717 SoT\u2019s answer (ChatGPT-3.5) (Orange texts are the skeleton.)\n1. Estimate the age of the Earth. The age of the Earth is estimated to be around 4.54 billion years, based on radiometric\ndating of rocks and meteorites.\n2. Determine when life began on Earth. Life on Earth is estimated to have begun around 3.5 billion years ago, based on\nthe discovery of ancient microfossils.\n3. Calculate the number of years since life began. The oldest known fossils suggest that life on Earth began around 3.5\nbillion years ago. Therefore, the number of years since life began on Earth is approximately 3.5 billion years.\n4. Divide the number of years by the length of one orbit. Assuming an orbital period of 365.25 days, the Earth has\norbited the Sun approximately 4.54 billion / 365.25 = 12,425,000 times since the beginning of life.\n5. The Earth has orbited the Sun approximately X times since the beginning of life. Unfortunately, it is impossible to give\na specific number for the amount of times the Earth has orbited the Sun since the beginning of life due to the uncertainties\nin estimating the age of the Earth and when life first emerged.\nNormal answer (ChatGPT-3.5)\nThe beginning of life on Earth is estimated to have occurred around 3.5 to 4 billion years ago. Since that time, the Earth\nhas been orbiting the Sun continuously.\nThe length of one orbit, or one year, is approximately 365.25 days. This means that the Earth completes one full orbit\naround the Sun every 365.25 days.\nTo calculate the number of times the Earth has orbited the Sun since the beginning of life, we can divide the total number\nof days by the length of one orbit:\nTotal number of days since the beginning of life = (3.5 billion years) x (365 days per year) = 1.2775 trillion days\nNumber of orbits = (1.2775 trillion days) / (365.25 days per orbit) = 3.5 billion orbits\nTherefore, the Earth has orbited the Sun approximately 3.5 billion times since the beginning of life.\nAs the following example shows, there are also cases when SoT solves the question (with minor\ncomputation errors) by embedding the computation steps in the skeleton directly in the skeleton\nstage. The point-expanding stage will then add little content (except some undesired repetition of\nthe following skeletons occasionally). This happens both on small/weak models and large/powerful\nmodels. Although this behavior is not what we originally expect, it sheds light on a promising direction for making SoT a general framework: in the problem where step-by-step thinking is needed, the\nSoT model automatically falls back to the sequential generation mode by outputting the complete\nanswer in the skeleton stage and skipping the point-expanding stage. Future work needs to be done\nto control and encourage this behavior better.\nQuestion:\n(Fermi) How many times does the average human blink in a lifetime? Try to explain your\nanswer. Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step.\nSoT\u2019s answer (Vicuna-7B V1.1) (Orange texts are the skeleton.)\n1. The average human blinks 12-15 times per minute.\n2. There are 60 minutes in an hour.\n3. Therefore, the average human blinks 60 x 12-15 = 720-900 times per hour.\n4. There are 24 hours in a day.Therefore, the average human blinks 720-900 x 24 = 17,520-22,400 times per day.\n5. Therefore, the average human blinks 720-900 x 24 = 17,520-22,400 times per day.This translates to blinking approximately 50-65 times per hour, which is a significant portion of the day.\n6. There are 365 days in a year.Therefore, the average human blinks 17,520-22,400 x 365 = 5,857,600-8,124,000 times\nper year.\n7. Therefore, the average human blinks 17,520-22,400 x 365 = 5,857,600-8,124,000 times per year.\n8. The human lifespan is typically 70-80 years.Therefore, the average human blinks 80,000-112,000 times in their\nlifetime.\n9. Therefore, the average human blinks 5,857,600-8,124,000 / 70-80 = 80,000-112,000 times in their lifetime.\nNormal answer (Vicuna-7B V1.1)\nThe average human blinks about 12-15 times per minute, which translates to about 18,200 to 20,400 blinks per day. Over\nthe course of a lifetime, the number of blinks is estimated to be around 7,500,000 to 8,000,000.\nBlinking is a reflexive action that helps to keep the eyes moist and comfortable, as well as to protect the eyes from dust\nand other foreign particles. The frequency of blinking can vary depending on a variety of factors, including age, health,\nand environmental conditions. For example, people who work in dusty or dry environments may blink more frequently\nthan those who work in a clean, moist environment.\nOver the course of a lifetime, the average person will spend approximately 27,375 days or 700,000 hours awake. This\nmeans that the majority of the time spent blinking will occur in the first few decades of life, with the frequency of blinking\ngradually decreasing as people age.\nIt is important to note that there is a significant amount of individual variation in the frequency of blinking. Some people\nmay blink more or less than the average, depending on a variety of factors such as age, health, and environmental condi-\ntions. Additionally, blinking patterns can be affected by factors such as stress, fatigue, and certain medical conditions.\n35\n\fSkeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding\n(3) Coding. While in most cases, the models are able to decompose the coding problem into smaller\ntasks in the skeleton stage, the generation quality during the point-expanding stage is bad, potentially\ndue to the fact that we did not carefully craft a special point-expanding prompt for coding. The\nfailure cases can be grouped into two cases. (a) In some cases, the model only generates a description\nof how implementation can be done without giving the code.\nQuestion:\n(Coding) Develop a C++ program that reads a text file line by line and counts the number\nof occurrences of a specific word in the file.\nSoT\u2019s answer (Claude) (Orange texts are the skeleton.)\n1. Open file stream by declaring an ifstream object and using the open() method to open the file in read mode.\n2. Read line by line from the file stream into a string using getline().\n3. Find word by searching each line for the target word using string::find and keeping track of matches.\n4. Increment counter by one each time the specified word is encountered in the current line.\n5. Close file\nThe file stream should be closed after finishing reading the file to free up resources. This can be done by calling the\nclose() method on the file stream object.\nThis might be due to the fact that the powerful models (e.g., Claude) follow the point-expanding\nprompt \u201cWrite it **very shortly** in 1\u223c2 sentence\u201d precisely. Better prompts tailed to coding\ncould help. (b) In some other cases, the model tends to generate the complete code repeatedly in\nseveral points.\nQuestion:\n(Coding) Develop a C++ program that reads a text file line by line and counts the number\nof occurrences of a specific word in the file.\nSoT\u2019s answer (OpenChat-13B) (Orange texts are the skeleton.)\n1. Read file line by line.\n2. Store lines in a container.\n3. Count occurrences of specific word.\n\u201c\u2018cpp\n\u00a1more texts are omitted...\u00bf\n\u201c\u2018\nThis code uses the C++ standard library to read a text file line by line, store each line in a container, and count the\noccurrences of a specific word. The results are printed.\n4. Print results.\nHere\u2019s the C++ program that reads a text file line by line and counts the number of occurrences of a specific word in the\nfile:\n\u201c\u2018cpp\n\u00a1more texts are omitted...\u00bf\n\u201c\u2018\nPlease note that this is a very basic implementation. You may need to adjust it depending on your specific requirements.\nThis problem might also be alleviated by prompts that explicitly tell the model to only generate a\n\u201ccode snippet\u201d in each skeleton point.\nAlthough better prompt engineering could lead to better results, we expect that SoT is not suitable\nfor the coding questions in Vicuna-80. The reason is that the solutions to the problems in Vicuna80 are usually in a few lines with strong dependencies between each other. Without knowing the\npreviously defined variable names or imported libraries, it is hard (or even impossible) to implement\nthe subsequent code correctly. As a consequence, generating different parts of the answers in parallel\nis not suitable here. Similar to the math questions, automatically falling back to outputting all the\ncode in the skeleton stage and not triggering the point-expanding stage might be more suitable for\nanswering this question type.\nHowever, we expect that SoT could be helpful for larger coding tasks that involve multiple modules\n(e.g., functions, classes). The skeleton stage could be in charge of defining the interfaces between\ndifferent modules (e.g., functionalities, names, parameters, return types). The point-expanding stage\ncould be in charge of implementing these modules or using these modules to complete the final task,\nwhich can be done in parallel. This mimics the common practice in software engineering.\n(4) Writing. The writing questions usually ask for an email, a blog post, or a review in a given\nscenario. In the detailed evaluation output from FastChat and LLMZoo metrics, the major and\ncommon complaint is that SoT\u2019s answers are (slightly) less detailed. This could potentially be\nimproved by point-expanding prompts that request more details.\n36\n\fSkeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding\nWhile inspecting SoT\u2019s answers manually, we observe one additional issue. Writing problems usually require a coherent passage without embedded skeleton points, whereas our current SoT pipeline\n(\u00a7 2) concatenates skeleton points as part of the answer. One example is shown below.\nQuestion:\n(Writing) Can you help me write a formal email to a potential business partner proposing\na joint venture?\nSoT\u2019s answer (ChatGPT-3.5) (Orange texts are the skeleton.)\n1. Introduce yourself and your company. Dear [Recipient],\nI hope this email finds you well. My name is [Your Name] and I am the [Your Position] at [Your Company Name].\n2. State the purpose of the email. The purpose of this email is to propose a joint venture between our companies.\n3. Explain the potential benefits of the joint venture. By combining our resources and expertise, we can increase market\nshare and profitability for both companies.\n4. Provide details on the proposed collaboration. Our proposed collaboration would involve combining our expertise in\nmarketing with your strong manufacturing capabilities to create a new line of products.\n5. Suggest a follow-up meeting or call. Please let me know your availability for a follow-up call next week to discuss\nthis opportunity further.\n6. Thank the recipient for their time and consideration.Thank you for considering this proposal and we look forward to\nhearing back from you soon.\nNormal answer (ChatGPT-3.5)\nOf course, I can help you with that. Here\u2019s a sample email you can use as a guide:\nSubject: Proposal for Joint Venture\nDear [Business Partner\u2019s Name],\nI hope this email finds you well. I am writing to propose a joint venture between our companies, [Your Company Name]\nand [Potential Partner Company Name].

We would\nlike to set up a meeting to discuss the specifics of our proposal and explore how we can move forward with the joint\nventure.\nThank you for considering this proposal. We look forward to hearing from you soon.\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\nIn such cases, simply removing the skeleton points would greatly improve the answer quality. To\nmake SoT more general, one future direction is to let the LLM itself decide whether the point index\nand point skeleton should be included to make the final answer more natural and fluent.\nCategories on which SoT has high net win rates.\n(1) Counterfactual, knowledge, common sense, generic. All these four categories have the same\ncharacteristic: the ideal answer should cover several relatively independent points. Having the LLM\ngenerate a skeleton before expanding the details can result in more comprehensive discussions for\nthe question. Besides, organizing the answers as a list of points makes the answers easier to read,\nwhereas the answers from normal generation are sometimes less structured and less readable. Below,\nwe give one example for each question category to illustrate these points.\n37\n\fSkeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding\nQuestion:\n(Counterfactual) What if the Internet had been invented during the Renaissance period?\nSoT\u2019s answer (ChatGPT-3.5) (Orange texts are the skeleton.)\n1. Advancements in communication.The invention of the Internet during the Renaissance period would have revolutionized communication, allowing for faster and more efficient exchange of ideas and information across vast distances.\n2. Increased access to knowledge.The invention of the printing press during the Renaissance period already allowed\nfor greater access to knowledge, but the internet would have revolutionized this even further by providing instantaneous\naccess to information from all over the world.\n3. Improved dissemination of ideas.If the internet had been invented during the Renaissance period, the spread of ideas\nand knowledge would have been much faster and widespread than it was at the time. This could have led to a faster\nprogression of scientific and artistic innovations.\n4. Impact on art and literature.The invention of the internet during the Renaissance period would have revolutionized the\nway art and literature are created, shared, and consumed, leading to a more diverse and globally-influenced artistic and\nliterary scene.\n5. Potential for global trade.The invention of the internet during the Renaissance period would have greatly expanded\nglobal trade opportunities, allowing for easier communication and collaboration between merchants and traders across\ncontinents.\n6. Influence on political and social structures.The invention of the internet during the Renaissance period could have led\nto significant changes in political and social structures, allowing for greater democratization and communication among\npeople from different regions and classes.\nNormal answer (ChatGPT-3.5)\nIf the Internet had been invented during the Renaissance period, it would have had a significant impact on the way people\ncommunicated, shared ideas, and gained knowledge. The Renaissance was a time of great intellectual and artistic growth,\nand the Internet would have facilitated the spread of these ideas and innovations.\nScholars and artists would have been able to share their work more easily, and people from different parts of the world\nwould have been able to connect and collaborate more easily. The Internet would have also made it easier to access\ninformation, which could have accelerated the pace of scientific and technological advancements.\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that the infrastructure required for the Internet to exist did not exist during the Renaissance\nperiod. There were no telecommunications networks or electricity grids, so the idea of the Internet would have been\nimpossible to realize. Nonetheless, it\u2019s interesting to think about how the Renaissance might have been different if the\nInternet had existed at that time.\n38\n\fSkeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding\nQuestion:\n(Knowledge) What are some potential implications of using a single-use plastic bottle\nversus a reusable bottle on both the environment and human health?\nSoT\u2019s answer (ChatGPT-3.5) (Orange texts are the skeleton.)\n1. Single-use plastic waste.Single-use plastic bottles contribute to the massive amount of plastic waste that ends up in\nlandfills and oceans, harming wildlife and ecosystems.\n2. Pollution of waterways.Single-use plastic bottles contribute to the pollution of waterways, as they often end up in\nrivers, lakes, and oceans, causing harm to aquatic life and the overall ecosystem.\n3. Harmful chemicals leaching.Single-use plastic bottles may release harmful chemicals such as bisphenol A (BPA) and\nphthalates into the water or liquid they contain, posing a risk to human health.\n4. Greenhouse gas emissions.The production and disposal of single-use plastic bottles contribute to greenhouse gas\nemissions, which contribute to climate change. Using a reusable bottle reduces the need for constant production and\ndisposal, therefore reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n5. Microplastic ingestion.Single-use plastic bottles contribute to the accumulation of microplastics in the environment,\nwhich can be ingested by humans through food and water, leading to potential health risks.\n6. Increased risk of disease.Single-use plastic bottles can harbor harmful bacteria, leading to an increased risk of disease\nif not disposed of properly. Reusable bottles, when cleaned regularly, pose a lower risk.\nNormal answer (ChatGPT-3.5)\nUsing a single-use plastic bottle has significant implications on the environment and human health.\nEnvironmental implications:\n1. Plastic pollution: Single-use plastic bottles are one of the major contributors to plastic pollution in oceans and landfills.\nThey take hundreds of years to decompose, and during that time, they release toxic chemicals and microplastics into the\nenvironment.\n2. Carbon emissions: Manufacturing and transporting single-use plastic bottles require a significant amount of energy\nand resources, which contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.\n3. Natural resource depletion: The production of single-use plastic bottles requires large amounts of water and oil, which\nare finite resources.\nHealth implications:\n1. Chemical exposure: Single-use plastic bottles contain chemicals such as Bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates, which\ncan leach into the water and pose a risk to human health.\n2. Microplastics ingestion: When plastic bottles break down, they release microplastics, which can enter the food chain\nand be ingested by humans.\nUsing a reusable bottle, on the other hand, has a positive impact on the environment and human health.\nEnvironmental benefits:\n1. Reduced plastic waste: Reusable bottles significantly reduce the amount of plastic waste generated.\n2. Lower carbon emissions: Reusable bottles have a lower carbon footprint as they can be used multiple times.\n3. Reduced resource depletion: The production of reusable bottles requires fewer resources than single-use plastic bottles.\nHealth benefits:\n1. Chemical-free: Reusable bottles are typically made from materials that are free from harmful chemicals, reducing the\nrisk of chemical exposure.\n2. Reduced microplastics: Reusable bottles do not break down easily, reducing the release of microplastics into the\nenvironment.\nOverall, using a reusable bottle is a more sustainable and healthier option than using a single-use plastic bottle.\nQuestion:\n(Common sense) How can you determine if a person is genuinely interested in a conversation or simply being polite?\nSoT\u2019s answer (ChatGPT-3.5) (Orange texts are the skeleton.)\n1. Pay attention to body language.Notice if their posture is open or closed, if they are facing towards you or away, and if\nthey are fidgeting or relaxed. These can all indicate their level of interest in the conversation.\n2. Listen for engaged responses.If the person is genuinely interested in the conversation, they will respond with thoughtful\nand relevant comments or questions rather than short, generic responses.\n3. Observe eye contact.If the person maintains steady eye contact and their gaze is focused on you, they are likely\ngenuinely interested in the conversation. On the other hand, if they frequently look away or seem distracted, they may\njust be being polite.\n4. Look for follow-up questions.If the person asks follow-up questions and seems genuinely interested in what you\u2019re\nsaying, then they are likely interested in the conversation and not just being polite.\n5. Notice tone of voice.A person who is genuinely interested in a conversation will often have a more enthusiastic and\nanimated tone of voice, compared to someone who is simply being polite and giving short, monotone responses.\nNormal answer (ChatGPT-3.5)\nAs an AI assistant, I cannot determine a person\u2019s true intentions or feelings. However, there are some social cues that\ncan indicate whether a person is genuinely interested in a conversation or not. For example, if they maintain eye contact,\nlean in, nod their head and ask follow-up questions, it can be a sign that they are engaged in the conversation. On the\nother hand, if they avoid eye contact, give short or vague responses, or seem distracted, it may indicate that they are\nnot as interested. Ultimately, it\u2019s important to remember that everyone has different communication styles, and it can be\ndifficult to accurately interpret someone\u2019s intentions without directly asking them.\n39\n\fSkeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding\nQuestion:\n(Generic) How can I improve my time management skills?\nSoT\u2019s answer (ChatGPT-3.5) (Orange texts are the skeleton.)\n1. Set clear goals. Setting clear goals is important in improving time management skills as it helps you to focus on what\nneeds to be done and what can be accomplished within a certain timeframe.\n2. Prioritize tasks. Make a list of tasks and prioritize them based on their importance and deadline. This will help you\nfocus on the most critical tasks and avoid wasting time on less important ones.\n3. Create a schedule. Creating a schedule helps you allocate time for each task and ensures that you complete them\nwithin the allotted time.\n4. Minimize distractions. Distractions such as social media, emails, and phone notifications can waste a lot of time. Try\nto limit them by turning off notifications or setting specific times to check them.\n5. Take breaks. Taking breaks can actually improve productivity and help prevent burnout. It\u2019s important to schedule\nshort breaks throughout the day to recharge and refocus.\n6. Learn to say no. It\u2019s important to prioritize your own tasks and not take on too much at once. Saying no to requests\nthat don\u2019t align with your goals or schedule can help you manage your time more effectively.\n7. Delegate tasks. If you have too many tasks to handle, consider delegating some of them to others who can help you.\nThis will allow you to focus on more important tasks and manage your time more effectively.\n8. Use time management tools.There are a variety of time management tools available, such as calendars, to-do lists, and\nproductivity apps, that can help you stay organized and on track with your tasks.\nNormal answer (ChatGPT-3.5)\nImproving time management skills can be a challenge, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are a few:\n1. Set clear goals and priorities: Identify your most important tasks and make sure to complete them first.\n2. Make a schedule: Create a schedule that includes your most important tasks and set aside time for them.\n3. Use a timer: Set a timer for a specific amount of time to help you stay focused and avoid distractions.\n4. Take breaks: Take short breaks throughout the day to help you recharge and avoid burnout.\n5. Eliminate distractions: Try to limit distractions as much as possible, such as by turning off your phone or closing your\nemail.\n6. Delegate tasks: If possible, delegate tasks to others to free up time for more important activities.\nRemember, improving time management skills takes practice and perseverance. Be patient with yourself and keep trying\nuntil you find strategies that work well for you.\n(2) Roleplay. Roleplay questions require LLMs to assume a character and present an introduction\nor speech to other people. LLMZoo and FastChat metrics usually favor the level of details of SoT\nwhen assigning it a better score. Similar to the writing category discussed before, SoT\u2019s answers\ncould be even better if the skeleton points are removed from the answer.\nQuestion:\n(Roleplay) How would you introduce yourself as a medieval knight at a royal banquet?\nSoT\u2019s answer (Claude) (Orange texts are the skeleton.)\n1. Name and house. My name is Sir Percival of Camelot, knight of the Round Table and protector of King Arthur\u2019s\nrealm.\n2. Lands and titles. I hold fiefdom over the lands of Westmarch and Ravenshire, and bear the titles of Baron of the\nWestern Marches and Knight of the Raven.\n3. Military feats. I have led my men to great victories against the kingdom\u2019s enemies, winning many battles through\nstrength of arms and tactical cunning.\n4. Allegiance to king. I pledge my sword, my loyalty, and my life to serve and protect my noble king and this great\nkingdom.\n5. Request to join table. Your Highness, it would be the greatest honor to join your exalted table and share in this\nmagnificent feast with my fellow knights and loyal subjects.\nNormal answer (Claude)\nGreetings, your majesty and honored guests. I am Sir Claude, a knight in service of the king. I hail from the province\nof Assistantia, where I was trained in the knightly virtues of chivalry, courage and courtesy. Though I am but a humble\nknight, I shall endeavor to serve you and this kingdom with all the strength and valor I possess. I thank you for allowing\nme to join you at this royal feast, and hope only that my conduct brings further honor to my liege and this noble court.\nPlease let me know if I can be of any service during the celebrations, as it would be my honor to assist you in any way.\nI.1.3\nANSWER ANALYSIS: DIFFERENT METRICS\nMetrics on which SoT has low net win rates.\n(1) Coherence. In the prompt of LLMZoo evaluation, coherence is defined as \u201cThe response should\nbe coherent and flow logically from one point to the next that is easy to read and understand without\nmajor gaps or inconsistencies. The more coherent they are, the better.\u201d SoT\u2019s answer is structured in\na list of points. It is suitable for some questions but not all. For example, in the questions that require\n40\n\fSkeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding\nLLMs to write a passage, email, or script, the introduction and conclusion paragraphs are usually\nmissing, and the answers usually lack transition sentences between consecutive points. These make\nthe answers less coherent. Below is one example from Claude.\nQuestion:\nWrite a script for a YouTube video exploring the history and cultural significance of jazz.\nSoT\u2019s answer (Claude) (Orange texts are the skeleton.)\n1. Origins. Jazz originated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries among African Americans in New Orleans, emerging\nfrom a combination of African rhythmic traditions, blues, ragtime, and other influences.\n2. Early jazz styles. The early styles of jazz that emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries included ragtime,\nDixieland, and the blues.\n3. Jazz age. The Jazz Age was the period during the 1920s when jazz music and dance styles like the Charleston became\npopular cultural phenomena in American and European society.\n4. Bebop era. Bebop emerged in the early 1940s with artists like Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker experimenting with\nfaster tempos, complex chord changes, and unpredictable melodic phrasing.\n5. Cool jazz. Emerging in the late 1940s and early 1950s, cool jazz was a more subdued, mellow style that broke from\nthe high-energy virtuosic improvisation of bebop.\n6. Free jazz emerged in the late 1950s and 1960s as musicians explored free improvisation and atonality, moving away\nfrom traditional jazz structures.\n7. Fusion jazz. Major jazz artists such as Miles Davis and Herbie Hancock began experimenting with combining elements\nof rock, funk, and electronic music in the 1970s, resulting in the emergence of the subgenre known as fusion jazz.\n8. Jazz festivals. Jazz festivals emerged in the 1950s and 1960s as a way to celebrate jazz music, with famous early\nfestivals like the Newport Jazz Festival bringing thousands of fans together to hear top performers.\n9. Jazz instruments. The trumpet, saxophone, piano, double bass, and drum set are some of the key instruments commonly used in jazz.\n10. Influential musicians include Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and\nmany others who pioneered new styles and techniques.\n11. Legacy and impact. Jazz has left an indelible mark on music and culture over the past century, influencing countless\nartists and genres while spreading the spirit of improvisation and freedom across the globe.\nNormal answer (Claude)\nHere is a draft script for a YouTube video exploring the history and cultural significance of jazz:\nIntroduction\nHey everyone! Welcome to my channel. In today\u2019s video, we\u2019re going to be exploring the history and cultural impact of\none of America\u2019s original art forms - jazz music.\nJazz Origins\nJazz grew out of the African American communities in the southern United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\nIt was influenced by a combination of African and European musical traditions. Some key elements that fed into early\njazz included blues, ragtime, spirituals, work songs, field hollers, and brass band music.\nNew Orleans is considered the birthplace of jazz, emerging around the turn of the 20th century. The city was a melting\npot of cultures and musical styles. Musicians mixed improvisation, syncopated rhythms, bent notes and a loose ensemble\nplaying style to create a new genre that became known as jazz.\nEarly jazz greats like Buddy Bolden, Jelly Roll Morton and Sidney Bechet began fusing these various influences into the\ndistinct jazz sound. As the music spread via travel and recordings in the 1910s, jazz captivated listeners and began to\nevolve into different styles.\nJazz Styles Emerge\nIn the 1920s, jazz expanded out from New Orleans and Chicago emerged as a hotspot. Louis Armstrong\u2019s innovative\nsolos and expressive phrasing became influential. The swing style also developed during the 1930s and 40s, propelled\nby star big bands and dancers.\nBebop arose in the 1940s with soloists like Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie exploring new levels of harmonic and\nrhythmic complexity. In the 50s and 60s, jazz expanded into new fusions like cool jazz, hard bop, free jazz, modal jazz\nand soul jazz. Artists used jazz to express their unique regional, social and political identities.\nCultural Significance\nOver the decades, jazz has become woven into the fabric of American society. It is equated with many values and ideals\nlike individualism, freedom, spontaneity, innovation and social harmony.\nJazz was associated with breaking down barriers between races, classes and genres. It represented modernism and urban\nculture. Musicians like Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington became some of the first widely popular African American\nartists.\nJazz also spread American culture and values abroad through performances, radio and film. It influenced music around\nthe world and became a truly global art form.\nToday jazz continues to thrive and evolve both in the U.S. and internationally. Its history and sounds reflect the diversity\nof both American and global cultures. From its folk roots, jazz has become a sophisticated art music that retains its spirit\nof freedom and improvisation.\nConclusion\nThat covers some of the key points in the history and cultural impact of jazz music. Let me know in the comments about\nyour favorite jazz styles and musicians! Be sure to like and subscribe. See you next time.\nWhile the content of SoT\u2019s answer is good, it reads less fluent for the purpose of a YouTube script.\n(2) Immersion. In the prompt of LLMZoo evaluation, immersion is defined as \u201cthe response should\nact like the assigned role using the tone, manner, and vocabulary the role would use. The more\nassistant-like tones, the worse. The more in-character, the better.\u201d The way that SoT breaks the\n41\n\fSkeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding\nanswers into a list makes its answer less in-character. Therefore, SoT receives a lower immersion\nscore. Here is one example.\nQuestion:\nPretend to be a world-famous chef. How would you describe your signature dish to a\npanel of judges?\nSoT\u2019s answer (Claude) (Orange texts are the skeleton.)\n1. Main ingredient: The incredibly fresh and tender salmon caught just this morning from the crystal clear waters of the\nPacific Northwest.\n2. Cooking method\nI slowly braise the main ingredient in a rich broth to bring out its natural flavors before searing it to a perfect golden crust.\n3. Special seasoning\nThe dish is seasoned with a blend of fresh herbs like thyme, rosemary, and oregano which provides an aromatic backbone\nthat pairs nicely with the natural flavors of the main ingredients. I add just a touch of smoked paprika to provide a subtle\nsmokiness without overpowering the other flavors.\n4. Texture: The dish has a perfect balance of crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, with each bite yielding a\ndelightful mix of crunchy and smooth textures that dance across your tongue.\n5. Plating presentation\nI purposefully create height and dimension on the plate with the carefully arranged components of the dish, so that the\ndish appears vibrant and alive. The interplay of colors, textures and shapes is intended to delight the eye before the first\nbite.\n6. Inspiration: This dish was inspired by my dear grandmother, who taught me the secret family recipe when I was just\na child.\nNormal answer (Claude)\n*clears throat and speaks in a fancy French accent*\nBonjour honored judges. Today I present to you my signature dish - la cr`eme de la cr`eme of French haute cuisine.\nBehold, le poulet `a la Claude!\nThis succulent chicken is firstly marinated overnight in a bath of fine herbes - thyme, rosemary, and sage cultivated from\nmy private garden. The young spring chicken is then roasted to perfection, its skin crisping to a beautiful caramel brown.\nNestled beside the chicken is a tower of pommes dauphine - light and airy potato puffs - alongside a decadent mound of\ncr`eme fra\u02c6\u0131che infused with truffle essence.\nBut the pi`ece de r\u00b4esistance is the sauce. A luxurious pool of velout\u00b4e enriched with cream and butter, brightened with a\ndash of lemon, and studded with morsels of morel mushrooms foraged at dawn.\nOne bite of this ensemble will transport you to food heaven. The tender chicken, the creaminess of the potato puffs, and\nthe rich decadence of the sauce meld together in blissful harmony.\nSo tell me honored judges, will my poulet `a la Claude earn your coveted approval? I await your discerning verdict as I\nswirl more vintage Bordeaux into your glasses. Sant\u00b4e!\nAgain, while the answer from SoT covers sufficient aspects and details, it reads rather stiffly. The\nnormal answer, in contrast, has the opening sentence \u201dBonjour honored judges. Today I present to\nyou my signature dish...\u201d and the conclusion statement \u201dSo tell me honored judges, will my poulet `a\nla Claude earn your coveted approval? ...\u201d which reads more like a casual talk from a chef.\nMetrics on which SoT has high net win rates.\n(1) Diversity. In the prompt of LLMZoo evaluation, diversity is defined as \u201cThe response should\nbe comprehensive and provide a range of information that is not limited to a single perspective.\nMore perspectives are better.\u201d The skeleton stage in SoT encourages LLMs to think from multiple\nperspectives. Therefore, SoT\u2019s answers tend to have better diversity. Below is one example showing\nthat SoT\u2019s answer has better diversity.\n42\n\fSkeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding\nQuestion:\nHow can you determine if a person is genuinely interested in a conversation or simply\nbeing polite?\nSoT\u2019s answer (ChatGPT-3.5) (Orange texts are the skeleton.)\n1. Pay attention to body language.Notice if their posture is open or closed, if they are facing towards you or away, and if\nthey are fidgeting or relaxed. These can all indicate their level of interest in the conversation.\n2. Listen for engaged responses.If the person is genuinely interested in the conversation, they will respond with thoughtful\nand relevant comments or questions rather than short, generic responses.\n3. Observe eye contact.If the person maintains steady eye contact and their gaze is focused on you, they are likely\ngenuinely interested in the conversation. On the other hand, if they frequently look away or seem distracted, they may\njust be being polite.\n4. Look for follow-up questions.If the person asks follow-up questions and seems genuinely interested in what you\u2019re\nsaying, then they are likely interested in the conversation and not just being polite.\n5. Notice tone of voice.A person who is genuinely interested in a conversation will often have a more enthusiastic and\nanimated tone of voice, compared to someone who is simply being polite and giving short, monotone responses.\nNormal answer (ChatGPT-3.5)\nAs an AI assistant, I cannot determine a person\u2019s true intentions or feelings. However, there are some social cues that\ncan indicate whether a person is genuinely interested in a conversation or not. For example, if they maintain eye contact,\nlean in, nod their head and ask follow-up questions, it can be a sign that they are engaged in the conversation. On the\nother hand, if they avoid eye contact, give short or vague responses, or seem distracted, it may indicate that they are\nnot as interested. Ultimately, it\u2019s important to remember that everyone has different communication styles, and it can be\ndifficult to accurately interpret someone\u2019s intentions without directly asking them.\nSoT answers the question from five aspects, whereas the normal answer only mentions one aspect.\n(2) Relevance. In the prompt of LLMZoo evaluation, relevance is defined as \u201cThe response should\nbe closely related to the question and answer the question accurately with sufficient details without\nrepetition or redundancy. The more relevant they are, the better.\u201d In the skeleton stage, LLMs are\nforced to propose several points around the question; and in the point-expanding stage, LLMs are\nrequired to only discuss these points. Therefore, answers from SoT tend to have better relevance.\nOne typical example is shown below.\nQuestion:\nWhy do some people enjoy the sensation of being scared, such as by watching horror\nmovies or going on roller coasters, while others avoid these experiences?\nSoT\u2019s answer (ChatGPT-3.5) (Orange texts are the skeleton.)\n1.\nNeurological differences.Some people enjoy the sensation of being scared due to the release of adrenaline and\ndopamine in the brain, while others may have a lower threshold for fear due to differences in their amygdala and prefrontal cortex.\n2. Psychological factors.Some people may enjoy the sensation of being scared because it can provide a sense of excitement, thrill, and a temporary escape from the mundane aspects of everyday life. On the other hand, others may avoid\nthese experiences due to past trauma or anxiety.\n3. Developmental experiences.Individuals who had negative experiences with fear during childhood, such as trauma\nor abuse, may avoid scary situations as adults, while those who had positive experiences with fear may seek out these\nexperiences.\n4. Cultural influences.Some cultures place a greater emphasis on seeking excitement and thrill, while others may prioritize safety and security, which can impact whether individuals enjoy scary experiences or avoid them.\n5. Genetics.Research has suggested that some individuals may have a genetic predisposition towards seeking out thrilling\nor risky experiences, which may include enjoying the sensation of being scared.\nNormal answer (ChatGPT-3.5)\nThe enjoyment of being scared is a complex psychological phenomenon. Some people may enjoy the adrenaline rush\nthat comes with being scared, while others may enjoy the feeling of being able to conquer their fears. Additionally,\nsome people may be more naturally inclined to seek out new experiences and sensations, including those that are scary\nor thrilling. On the other hand, some people may be more risk-averse or may have had negative experiences with fear or\nanxiety in the past, which could make them more likely to avoid scary experiences. Ultimately, the reasons why some\npeople enjoy being scared while others do not are likely to be influenced by a range of factors, including personality, past\nexperiences, and individual preferences.\nIn the answer from the normal generation, the first two sentences provide little information in answering the question, and the last sentence only gives keywords such as \u201cpersonality, past experiences, and individual preferences\u201d without providing concrete explanations to each. In contrast,\n43\n\fSkeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding\n-20%\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\ncounterfactual\ngeneric\ncommon-sense\nknowledge\nroleplay\nfermi\nwriting\nSoT (w/o router)\nSoT-R w/ prompting router\nSoT-R w/ trained router\nSoT-R w/ human router\nFigure 22: Net win rates of SoT and SoT-R on different question categories of Vicuna-80 dataset\nusing the general quality metric from LLMZoo.

SoT-R correctly falls back to normal decoding on\nquestions where SoT is not suitable.\nSoT\u2019s answer is well-structured into five reasons with sufficient explanations and it does not waste\nspace in irrelevant contents.\nI.2\nSKELETON-OF-THOUGHT WITH ROUTER\nFig. 22 shows net win rates of SoT on Vicuna-80 dataset with LLMZoo metrics, and Fig. 23 shows\nnet win rates of SoT on WizardLM dataset with FastChat metrics. The key takeaways are: (1) In\nboth cases, SoT-R achieves similar or better quality than SoT, and the net win rates of SoT-R are\nusually non-negative. This indicates that SoT-R falls back to normal decoding on the right question\ncategories. (2) On the WizardLM dataset, we see that the trained router has better performance than\nthe prompting router in most cases. This is reasonable, as the prompting router is limited by the\ncapability of GPT-4, whereas the trained router is dedicated to this task. (3) Sometimes, our routers\ncan even achieve better performance than humans.\nI.3\nCHATGPT-3.5 AS THE JUDGE\nIn this section, we provide quality evaluation results with ChatGPT-3.5 as the judge in FastChat and\nLLMZoo metrics. Note that as prior work (e.g., (Li et al., 2023b)) shows, GPT-4-based evaluation\nusually aligns with human better than ChatGPT-3.5. Therefore, readers should refer to the results\nin the main paper (with GPT-4 as the judge) for a more accurate view of the performance of SoT.\nHowever, the takeaway messages from ChatGPT-3.5 are similar to the ones from GPT-4.\n44\n\fSkeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding\nI.3.1\nOVERALL QUALITY\nIn Fig. 24, we show the win/tie/lose rates (the percentage of the cases when SoT wins/ties/loses\ncompared to normal generation) across all models and questions using the two metrics from FastChat\nand LLMZoo that capture the general quality of the answers. We notice a discrepancy between the\ntwo metrics on when SoT is strictly better than the baseline (50.2% v.s. 12.4%). Despite that, the two\nmetrics agree that SoT is not worse than the baseline in more than 76% of the cases. For FastChat\nmetric, we also show the rates excluding math and coding questions that SoT is not suitable for (see\n\u00a7 3.2.3); SoT is not worse than the baseline in more than 89% of the cases. This result suggests that\nthe answers of SoT maintain good quality.\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\nGeneral quality (LLMZoo)\nGeneral quality (FastChat)\n(excluding math & coding)\nGeneral quality (FastChat)\n50.2%\n12.5%\n12.4%\n27.3%\n76.7%\n69.2%\n22.5%\n10.8%\n18.4%\nWin\nTie\nLose\nFigure 24: Win/tie/lose rates of SoT v.s. normal generation using \u201cgeneral\u201d metrics from FastChat\nand LLMZoo. SoT performs better than or equal to normal generation in around 80% of cases.\n(Evaluated using ChatGPT-3.5 as the judge.)\nI.3.2\nQUALITY BREAKDOWN: QUESTION CATEGORIES\nNext, we investigate how SoT performs on different question categories. We compute net win rates\n(win rates minus lose rates) across all question categories in Fig. 25. Similar to Fig. 24, we see\nthat LLMZoo tends to be more optimistic about the quality of SoT than FastChat. Nevertheless,\nthe conclusions are consistent: SoT performs relatively well on generic, common-sense, knowledge,\nroleplay, and counterfactual. SoT performs relatively badly on writing, fermi, math, and coding.\n-60% -50% -40% -30% -20% -10%\n0%\n10%\n20%\ncounterfactual\nroleplay\nknowledge\ngeneric\ncommon-sense\nfermi\nwriting\nmath\ncoding\n(a) Metric: general quality (FastChat).\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\ncounterfactual\nroleplay\nknowledge\ngeneric\ncommon-sense\nfermi\nwriting\n(b) Metric: general quality (LLMZoo).\nFigure 25: Net win rates of SoT on different question categories.

Again, we see that the two general metrics from FastChat and LLMZoo have\ndifferent absolute values but similar rankings. In particular, both metrics agree that OpenChat13B, Vicuna-7B V1.1, Claude, ChatGPT-3.5 have low net win rates, whereas Vicuna-13B V1.3,\nStableVicuna-13B, and UltraLM-13B have high net win rates.\nI.3.4\nQUALITY BREAKDOWN: QUESTION CATEGORIES AND MODELS\nIn the main text, we analyze how question categories and models affect SoT\u2019s answer quality independently.

(4) Move detailed answer analysis to the appendices.\n\ninference latency since the generation of tokens cannot be parallelized. There is a bunch of literature addressing the first two axes: _large model size_(Xiao et al., 2022; Frantar et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2023; Sheng et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2021) and _attention operation_(Kitaev et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Dao et al., 2022; Zaheer et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2023b). These works either compress/redesign the model (Xiao et al., 2022; Frantar et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2023; Kitaev et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Dao et al., 2022; Zaheer et al., 2020) or redesign the serving system (Sheng et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023) and hardware (Wang et al., 2021).\n\nIn contrast to prior work, we tackle the third axis and question the common assumption that LLMs have to do fully sequential decoding. We show the feasibility of **parallel decoding of off-the-shelf LLMs _without_ any changes to their model, system, or hardware**. For instance, for the question in Fig. 1, we can reduce the latency from 22 seconds to 12 seconds (1.83\\(\\times\\) speed-up) with Claude, and from 43 seconds to 16 seconds (2.69\\(\\times\\) speed-up) with Vicuna-33B V1.3 on an NVIDIA A100.\n\nThe idea stems from reflecting on how humans ourselves answer questions. Humans do _not_ always think about questions and write answers in a sequential fashion. In contrast, for many question types, we first derive the _skeleton_ according to some protocols and strategies, and then add evidence and details to refine and explicate each point. This is especially the case on formal occasions like offering consultancy, taking tests, writing papers, and so on. Can we make LLMs think in the same way? To this end, we propose _Skeleton-of-Thought (SoT)_. Specifically, as shown in Fig. 1, we guide the LLM to derive a skeleton first by itself. Based on the skeleton, the LLMs can complete each point _in parallel_ so that we get a speed-up. SoT can be utilized to accelerate both open-source models with batched decoding and API-based models with parallel API calls.\n\nTo make the overall solution more practical, we also design an extension, SoT with router (SoT-R), which employs a router to only trigger SoT for suitable questions.\n\nWe test SoT on 12 recently released LLMs. Not only does SoT provide considerable speed-ups (up to 2.39\\(\\times\\)), but it can also improve the answer quality in many cases (Fig. 1).\n\nNote that in contrast to existing model- and system-level efforts for inference efficiency, SoT takes a novel \"data-level\" pathway by letting the LLM organize its output content. This novel perspective is becoming feasible and is expected to grow in relevance, owing to the evolving capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs. We hope this work can stimulate more research in the realm of data-centric optimization (Zha et al., 2023; HazyResearch, 2023) for efficiency.\n\nFigure 1: **Left:** An illustration of Skeleton-of-Thought (SoT). Instead of producing answers sequentially, SoT produces different parts of answers _in parallel_. In more detail, given the question, SoT first prompts the LLM to give out the skeleton, then conducts batched decoding or parallel API calls to expand multiple points in parallel, and finally aggregates the outputs to get the final answer. **Right:** The net win rates and speed-ups of SoT with router (SoT-R) compared to normal generation on Vicuna-80. The net win rate is the difference between the fraction of questions that SoT-R has better and worse answers than normal generation. The speed-up is the ratio between the latency of normal and SoT-R generation. \\((1.0,0.0)\\) represents normal generation. Higher is better on both axes. For most models, SoT-R not only accelerates the generation but also improves the quality of the answers (evaluated with FastChat metric (Zheng et al., 2023)). See \u00a7 3.2 and 4 for more details.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. We first introduce SoT in SS 2 and show its results in SS 3. Then, we expand on the SoT-R extension in SS 4. SS 5 positions SoT in the research ecosystem (expanded in App. D). Finally, we analyze the limitations and share outlooks of SoT in SS 6.\n\n## 2 Skeleton-of-Thought (SoT)\n\n### Method\n\n**Overview.** Based on the intuition that humans usually think about and answer a question in an organized way, the core idea of this work is to guide the LLM itself to give a skeleton first and then write the overall answer parallelly instead of sequentially. Fig. 1 illustrates how SoT produces the final answer to a user _question_\\(q\\).\n\n_(1) Skeleton stage._ SoT first assembles a _skeleton request_, \\(T^{s}(\\text{question}=q)\\), using the _skeleton prompt template_\\(T^{s}\\) (Prompt 1, and Prompt 3 in App. B.1) with the question \\(q\\) as the parameter. The skeleton prompt template is written to guide the LLM to output a concise skeleton of the answer. Then, we extract the \\(B\\) points from the _skeleton response_\\(R^{s}\\) of the LLM.\n\n_(2) Point-expanding stage._ Based on the skeleton, we let the LLM expand on each point in parallel. Specifically, for the point with index \\(b\\) and skeleton \\(R^{s}_{b}\\), SoT uses \\(T^{pe}(\\text{question}=q,\\text{skeleton}=R^{s},\\text{point index}=b,\\text{point skeleton}=R^{s}_{b})\\) as the _point-expanding request_ for the LLM, where \\(T^{pe}\\) is the _point-expanding prompt template_ (Prompt 2). Finally, after completing all points, we concatenate the point-expanding responses \\(\\{R^{pe}_{b}\\}_{b=1,\\cdots,B}\\) to get the _final answer_.\n\n**Parallel point expanding.** We conduct _parallel_ point-expanding so that SoT is able to achieve a speed-up than normal decoding.\n\n_(1) For proprietary models with only API access_, we can issue multiple parallel API calls to get an end-to-end latency gain at the cost of an increased number of API requests and tokens.\n\n_(2) For open-source models that we can run locally_, we let them process the point-expanding requests as a batch (paddings are added to the left of the point-expanding requests). We explain below why this could achieve speed-ups. A typical LLM generative process consists of two phases: (a) the _prefilling_ phase in which the prompt is parsed to generate the key-value cache for further use, and (b) the _decoding_ phase in which tokens are generated one by one in a sequential manner. The decoding phase accounts for the majority of the end-to-end latency, especially when generating a long response. Note that the decoding phase is bottlenecked by weight loading instead of activation loading or computation.1 Consequently, running LLM inference with increased batch sizes does not increase the per-token latency much. Therefore, SoT allows us to decode roughly \\(B\\times\\) more tokens within the same amount of time if we parallelly decode \\(B\\) points. See App. E for the expanded discussions and the supporting experiments.\n\nFootnote 1: This is true when the number of concurrent queries is small; see \u00a7 6 for discussion on other scenarios.\n\nPlease refer to App. B for more implementation details of SoT.\n\n## 3 SoT Evaluation\n\n**Datasets.** We evaluate SoT on two recent assistant-style datasets: (1) Vicuna-80 (Chiang et al., 2023), which contains 80 questions spanning nine categories, such as _coding_, _math_, _writing_, _roleplay_, and so on, and (2) WizardLM Xu et al. (2023), which contains 218 questions spanning more categories and diverse difficulties. Due to space constraints, we only report Vicuna-80 results in the main paper, and defer WizardLM results to the Apps. G and I.\n\n**Models.** We test SoT on 12 recently released models, including 9 open-source models and 3 API-based models (Table 1). We obtain the weights of all the open-source models from Hugging Face. See App. A for more details.\n\n### Evaluation of Efficiency\n\n**API-based models.** We record the latency of every API call with start = time.time();...; elapsed_time = time.time() - start, and add the latency of the skeleton API call and the slowest point-expanding API call as the SoT latency.\n\n**Open-source models.** All open-source models we currently evaluate are based on the LLaMA 7B, 13B, or 33B architectures. Thus, to enable fast analysis, we first make a latency profiling table for each LLaMA architecture on NVIDIA A100. The table contains the architecture's (1) latency for prefiling sequences of length 1 to 700 with different batch sizes (from 1 to 16), and (2) decoding one token with a context of length 1 to 1024 with different batch sizes (from 1 to 16). With these three latency profiling tables, given the number of points \\(B\\), the token lengths of the requests and responses in the skeleton and point-expanding stages, we can quickly estimate the SoT latency by simply looking up entries in the tables and adding them up. See App. F for a more detailed description of how we conduct the profiling and estimate the latency.\n\nIn addition to the above approach, we also compare the actual latency of SoT and normal sequential generation (abbreviated as \"normal\" in the following discussion) in App. G.1.4.\n\nThe rest of this section shows the speed-ups of SoT on different models (SS 3.1.1) and question categories (SS 3.1.2). In addition, we also report the latency breakdown of SoT stages in App. G.1.2 and the SoT speed-ups on an RTX 3090 GPU in App. G.1.3.\n\n#### 3.1.1 Speed-up Breakdown: Models\n\nWe investigate how SoT reduces the end-to-end latency on different models. Fig. 1(a) shows the average speed-up for each model across all question categories. We can see that SoT obtains a \\(>\\)2\\(\\times\\) speed-up (up to 2.39\\(\\times\\)) on 8 out of 12 models.\n\nWe report the detailed statistics about token lengths and numbers of points in Fig. 11. (1) In terms of _the point number_\\(B\\) (Fig. 10(a)), LLaMA2, Vicuna-7B V1.1, Vicuna-7B V1.3, and ChatGPT-3.5 yield relatively fewer points (\\(<\\)6), while GPT-4 and StableVicuna-13B generates the largest number of points on average (\\(\\approx\\)9). (2) Regarding _the point-expanding response length_, Figs. 10(b) to 10(d) show that the API-based models, ChatGPT-3.5, Claude, and GPT-4, follow the point-expanding request better and generate shorter point-expanding responses than the open-source models. One can also notice that StableVicuna-13B's longest point-expanding responses for many question categories can be as lengthy as the overall normal answer, since it fails to adhere to the \"Write it **very shortly**\" instruction in the point-expanding request. Consequently, SoT cannot accelerate StableVicuna-13B well. (3) Regarding _the length balance degree between point responses_, Fig. 10(e) shows that LLaMA2 and the API-based models generate more balanced point-expanding responses.\n\n(4) As for _the overall length of the final aggregated answer_ (Fig. 10(f)), employing SoT on most models results in answers that are, on average, 1\\(\\sim\\)2\\(\\times\\) longer than the normal answer.\n\n#### 3.1.2 Speed-up Breakdown: Question Categories\n\nHere we investigate how SoT reduces the end-to-end latency for different question categories. Fig. 1(b) shows the average speed-up for each question category across all models. The question categories for which SoT can provide high-quality answers are marked in green, and other categories are marked in red (see SS 3.2.3 for the answer quality evaluation). We can see that SoT can obtain speed-ups for all question categories. For the five question categories that SoT can provide high-quality answers (i.e., _knowledge_, _generic_, _common-sense_, _roleplay_, _counterfactual_), SoT can speed up the overall answer generation process by 1.89\\(\\times\\) to 2.33\\(\\times\\) in the meantime.\n\n### Evaluation of Answer Quality\n\nIn order to compare the answer quality of the normal sequential generation (abbreviated as \"normal\" in the following discussion) and SoT generation, we adopt two LLM-based evaluation frameworks: FastChat (Zheng et al., 2023) and LLMZoo (Chen et al., 2023c). The evaluation process is to present a question and a pair of answers (from normal or SoT generation) to an LLM judge (GPT-4 in the main paper; see App. 1.3 for the results evaluated using ChatGPT-3.5) and ask for its preference. The response can be that SoT's answer wins/ties/loses compared to the normal answer.\n\nHere are more details about the evaluation of the answer quality:\n\n_(1) Detailed metrics._ FastChat evaluation provides one metric for the general quality of the answers. In addition to a general metric, LLMZoo provides five detailed metrics on the answers' coherence, diversity, immersion, integrity, and relevance.\n\n_(2) Question categories._ FastChat provides two special evaluation prompts for coding and math questions for more accurate evaluation, whereas LLMZoo does not. Following the implementation in LLMZoo, we exclude math and coding questions in all LLMZoo evaluation results.\n\n_(3) Extentions to avoid evaluation bias._ To avoid the potential bias from the order of the two answers presented to the LLM judge, we extend FastChat and LLMZoo evaluation frameworks by running the evaluation twice with either ordering of the two answers. In either evaluation, a score of 1, 0, and -1 is assigned when SoT wins, ties, or loses, respectively. The final evaluation is that SoT wins/ties/loses when the sum of the two scores is positive/zero/negative. For example, if SoT wins in one evaluation and loses in the other evaluation, the result is \"tie\". If SoT wins (loses) in one evaluation and ties in the other, the result is \"win\" (\"lose\").\n\n_(4) Net win rates._ We further define net win rates to give a summarized view of the answer quality. Given the number of questions that SoT wins (#win) and loses (#lose), we define _net win rates_ as \\(\\nicefrac{{\\text{\\#win}-\\text{\\#loss}}}{{\\text{\\text{total number of questions}}}}\\). 0% means that SoT performs competitively to the normal baseline (wins and loses in the same number of questions). Higher values mean that SoT performs better.\n\nThe organization of this section on answer quality evaluation is as follows. We first present the overall quality of SoT answers (SS 3.2.1), and then go into the details across different question categories (SS 3.2.3), models (SS 3.2.2), and metrics (SS 3.2.4).\n\nFigure 2: Average speed-ups of SoT on different models and question categories.\n\n#### 3.2.1 Overall Quality\n\nIn Fig. 3, we show the win/tie/lose rates (the percentage of the cases when SoT wins/ties/loses compared to normal generation) across all models and questions using the two metrics from FastChat and LLMZoo that capture the general quality of the answers. We notice a discrepancy between the two metrics on when SoT is strictly better than the baseline (45.8% v.s. 29.5%). Despite that, the two metrics agree that SoT is not worse than the baseline in around 60% of the cases, and the win rates are close to the lose rates. _This result suggests that the answers of SoT maintain good quality of that of the normal generation._\n\n#### 3.2.2 Quality Breakdown: Models\n\nNext, we investigate how SoT performs on different models. We compute net win rates on all models in Fig. 4. Again, we see that the two general metrics from FastChat and LLMZoo have different absolute values but similar rankings. In particular, both metrics agree that OpenChat-13B, Vicuna-7B V1.1, Claude, LLaMA2-Chat-13B have _low_ net win rates, whereas Vicuna-13B V1.3, StableVicuna-13B, and UltraLM-13B have _high_ net win rates.\n\nWe investigate the answers in App. I.1.1, and summarize the key takeaways as follows. Some models have low SoT quality as they cannot understand the skeleton and point-expanding prompts well. Some other models have low SoT quality as their normal answers already have good quality, making it hard for SoT to beat them (e.g., Claude). For models that are able to understand the SoT prompts, the answer quality is improved. We expect that further improving SoT prompts or fine-tuning the models can make it easier for LLMs to understand the skeleton and point-expanding prompts and ultimately result in better answer quality.\n\n#### 3.2.3 Quality Breakdown: Question Categories\n\nNext, we investigate how SoT performs on different question categories. We compute _net win rates_ (win rates minus lose rates) on all question categories in Fig. 5. Similar to Fig. 3, we see that LLMZoo tends to be more optimistic about the quality of SoT than FastChat. Nevertheless, the conclusions are consistent: SoT performs relatively _well_ on _generic_, _common-sense_, _knowledge_, _roleplay_, and _counterfactual_. SoT performs relatively _poorly_ on _writing_, _fermi_, _math_, and _coding_.\n\nWe investigate the answers in App. I.1.2, and summarize the key takeaways as follows. SoT performs well when the question can be answered in several points whose details can be expanded independently. This includes a wide range of real-world questions. On the other hand, it is fundamentally challenging to apply SoT on questions that require step-by-step thinking, in which the\n\nFigure 4: Net win rates of SoT on different models.\n\nFigure 3: Win/tie/lose rates of SoT v.s. normal generation using \u201cgeneral\u201d metrics from FastChat and LLMZoo. SoT performs better than or equal to normal generation in around 60% cases.\n\nlatter steps require the details from the earlier steps, such as math questions. To make SoT general across broader question categories, one promising pathway is to enable SoT to adaptively fall back to normal generation, which we explore in SS 4. Interestingly, our results suggest that some LLMs are already able to do that occasionally without special prompting or tuning (see App. I.1.2).\n\n#### 3.2.4 Quality Breakdown: Metrics\n\nAll previous evaluations use metrics about the general quality of the answer. In Fig. 6, we show more detailed metrics from LLMZoo to reveal in which aspects SoT can improve or hurt the answer quality. On average, we can see that SoT improves the diversity and relevance while hurting the immersion and coherence.\n\nThrough answer investigation (App. I.1.3), we summarize the key takeaways as follows. The skeleton stage of SoT explicitly require LLMs to discuss the answers from multiple aspects without filler words. This improves the diversity and relevance of the answers. As for coherence and immersion, SoT is not worse than the normal generation around 60% of the time. One future direction is to improve the SoT prompts or pipeline so that the answers can be better in more metrics.\n\n## 4 SoT with Router (SoT-R): Adapatively Triggering SoT\n\nIn SS 3, we see that SoT provides considerable speed-ups while maintaining (or even improving) answer quality for many question types. However, the biggest limitation is that SoT is not suitable for questions that require step-by-step reasoning (SS 3.2.3). Towards pushing the practical adoption of SoT, we explore the possibility of _adaptively triggering SoT_ only when it is suitable. To achieve that, we propose a _router_ module that decides if SoT should be applied for the user request, and then call either SoT or normal decoding accordingly. This paradigm aligns with the recent trends of composing multiple models to solve complicated tasks (Chase, 2022; Shen et al., 2023). To implement the router, we explore two options: LLM prompting as the router (no model training is needed) (SS 4.1), and trained RoBERTa as the router (SS 4.2). The evaluation is provided in SS 4.3.\n\n### Prompting Router\n\nWe directly ask an LLM if the question is suitable for SoT. More specifically, we ask the LLM if the desired answer is in a list of independent points (see App. C.1 for the prompt). If the answer is yes,\n\nFigure 5: Net win rates of SoT on different question categories.\n\nFigure 6: Win/tie/lose rates of SoT v.s. normal generations using metrics from LLMZoo. SoT performs well on diversity and relevance, and relatively worse on coherence and immersion.\n\nwe will use SoT; otherwise, we will use normal generation (i.e., directly feeding the question to the LLM). We employ GPT-4 as the LLM router given its strong capability.\n\n### Trained Router\n\nWhile leveraging GPT-4 as the router obviates the need for model training, its performance remains sensitive to prompt design. Therefore, we approach the problem as a sequence classification task by fine-tuning a small language model as the router. Specifically, we annotate the LIMA dataset (Zhou et al., 2023) as the training set to train a RoBERTa model (Liu et al., 2019), which has only 120M parameters. Comprehensive details regarding the annotation and training processes can be found in Apps. C.2.1 and C.2.2, respectively.\n\n### SoT-R Evaluation\n\nWe compare SoT and SoT-R under the same evaluation setup in SS 3. Besides the prompting and trained routers, we also consider a \"human router\" where we manually judge whether SoT should be applied for each question. This serves as a benchmark for comparison.\n\n#### 4.3.1 Evaluation of Efficiency\n\nFig. 8 shows the speed-ups of SoT and SoT-R for different models on the Vicuna-80 dataset (see App. G.2 for more results on the WizardLM dataset). We can see that: (1) As expected, SoT-R obtains lower speed-ups than SoT, since SoT is not triggered for some questions and the router induces a small latency overhead. Nevertheless, SoT-R can still benefit most models with \\(>\\)1\\(\\times\\) speed-ups. (2) SoT-R with the trained router obtains slightly higher speed-ups for 7 out of 12 models on Vicuna-80, while SoT-R with the prompting router obtains higher speed-ups for all models on the WizardLM dataset (see Fig. 17 in App. G.2).\n\n#### 4.3.2 Evaluation of Answer Quality\n\nFig. 8 shows the net win rates (averaged across all models) of SoT and SoT-R on Vicuna-80 with the FastChat metrics (see App. 1.2 for results of the WizardLM dataset and LLMZoo metrics). We can see that: (1) SoT-R significantly improves the answer quality on questions where SoT is not suitable (e.g., _coding_, _math_, _writing_, _fermi_) by falling back to normal decoding. At the same time, SoT-R maintains answer quality improvements on questions where SoT is good at. (2) The trained router performs similar to (on Vicuna-80) or better than (on WizardLM; see App. 1.2) the prompting router. This accords with our intuition in SS 4.2. (3) The prompting and trained routers could even surpass human router (e.g., on roleplay questions; see more examples on WizardLM in App. 1.2).\n\nWe discuss the consistency across three routers in App. C.3. The primary takeaways include: (1) on Vicuna-80, there is a notable consistency among all three routers, and (2) on WizardLM, greater discrepancies emerge, with the trained router showing higher alignment with human annotations.\n\n## 5 Related Work\n\nThis section positions SoT in related work to reveal how SoT (1) is connected to, (2) is different from, and (3) can harness the power of other methods. See App. D for the expanded discussion.\n\n**Efficient LLM methods at model and system levels.** At the model level, prior work proposes efficient architectures, including dynamic mixture-of-experts (Lepikhin et al., 2021), low-complexity\n\nFigure 8: Net win rates of SoT and SoT-R on different question categories of the Vicuna-80 dataset (evaluated with the FastChat metrics).\n\nFigure 7: Speed-ups of SoT and SoT-R on different models across all question categories of the Vicuna-80 dataset.\n\nattention (Kitaev et al., 2020), and multi-query attention (Shazeer, 2019). However, they usually require a significant re-training cost. In contrast, compression methods require a smaller amount of fine-tuning cost by reducing the complexity of pre-trained LLMs, such as quantization (Frantar et al., 2022) and weight or activation sparsification (Mishra et al., 2021; Zaheer et al., 2020).\n\nAt the system level, prior work (1) optimizes the computational graph (Dao et al., 2022), (2) optimizes the assignment and scheduling of computational graph on devices (Sheng et al., 2023), or (3) designs batching or caching mechanisms for serving multiple users (Fang et al., 2021). These techniques address the large memory access and footprint posed by the vast model scale and attention mechanism, and mainly aim at enhancing the throughput rather than the end-to-end latency. As SoT trades off throughput for end-to-end latency, _SoT can make these throughput-oriented techniques help with end-to-end latency_. This interesting synergy offers opportunities for achieving better trade-offs between latency and throughput in future serving systems.\n\n_In contrast to model- and system-level techniques, SoT is a data-level technique in a new \"content co-organization for efficiency\" paradigm._ See SS 6 for more discussions.\n\n**Efficient LLM methods through parallel generation.** Some prior work also addresses the sequential decoding issues. Speculative decoding (SD) methods (Stern et al., 2018) employ smaller models to generate some consecutive tokens sequentially and apply the target LLMs to verify them parallelly. Non-autoregressive generation (NAG) methods (Gu et al., 2018; Xiao et al., 2023) sample and refine consecutive tokens parallelly, often with the support of a modified and tuned model.\n\nRelying on either assisting models or special models and sampling schemes, SD and NAG methods conduct _parallel verification or sampling and refinement of consecutive tokens_. In contrast, SoT prompts the LLM _itself_ to plan the contents in a way that permits _the parallel generation of tokens in different segments_, by exploiting the emerging instruction-following and planning ability of LLMs.\n\n**Prompting methods for LLMs.** Recent years have witnessed the emergence of the \"pre-train, prompt, and predict\" paradigm, which has shown promise in enhancing LLMs' quality in math and commonsense reasoning (Wei et al., 2022; Kojima et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2022) and planning for multi-modality tasks (Shen et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023). Instead of focusing on answer quality, _SoT is a first attempt at exploiting the power of prompting to improve efficiency_.\n\n## 6 Limitations, Future Work, and Open Questions\n\n**Answer quality evaluation.** Our answer quality evaluation is far from perfect due to the limited prompt set, the potential bias of GPT-4 judges, and the inherent difficulty of evaluating LLM generations. Currently, we did not conduct human evaluation since it is easy for a human to tell whether an answer is generated with SoT due to its distinctive pattern, which might cause evaluation bias. We leave a more thorough evaluation of answer quality to future work.\n\n**Eliciting or improving LLMs' ability.** SS 3.2.4 demonstrates SoT's potential of enhancing answer quality. It is part of a broader trend in recent research, exemplified by work including CoT (Kojima et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022), IoT (Yao et al., 2023), and ReAct (Yao et al., 2022), which collectively affirm the notion that _explicitly articulating the thought process in language can elicit high-quality answers from LLMs_. These findings resemble human thinking: rather than relying solely on the first intuition or purely sequential thinking, we often document step-by-step reasoning or thought organization to attain high-quality answers. This intriguing parallel prompts us to explore further how we can draw from the human thinking process to facilitate more effective and efficient AI.\n\nFor instance, SoT currently ignores the dependencies between points. A conceptually better way is to organize the points as _Graph-of-Thoughts_, where the edges represent the dependencies, and each point is decoded conditioned on the contents of its ancestor points. In addition, instead of complying with a _static_ graph, we expect the need of having _dynamic Graph-of-Thoughts_, where the high-level thought structure is adjusted dynamically by LLMs themselves. This could potentially combine the efficiency and global thinking advantages of SoT with the logical reasoning and imprompt thinking strengths of methods like CoT (Kojima et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022). Notably, a contemporary work (Besta et al., 2023) has attempted to design Graph-of-Thoughts to elicit reasoning.\n\nFurthermore, there exist self-improving training pipelines (Zelikman et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2022) that use rationales generated by CoT to fine-tune LLMs, thereby enhancing their reasoning abilities.\n\nLikewise, it is interesting to investigate how the more structured answers from SoT can be used to fine-tune LLMs to enhance their ability to generate well-organized and comprehensive answers.\n\n**Efficiency and overhead of SoT in different scenarios.** Serving systems commonly adopt batch processing to handle concurrent queries. This raises a concern of whether SoT may hurt serving throughput due to parallel requests. (1) When there is an unsaturated number of concurrent queries, SoT can effectively reduce latency and enhance GPU utilization. Example scenarios include (a) Edge-side applications with a single user; (b) Centralized services during periods with unsaturated user requests and underutilized computing capacity. It is interesting to study the appropriate SoT triggering conditions based on system workloads. (2) When there is a saturated number of concurrent queries, SoT is still useful for improving answer quality. However, in this case, it is important to consider the computation overhead from SoT. We delve into this concern in App. H.\n\nFor API-based models, a notable concern arises regarding the increased number of prefilling tokens (App. H). Given that many APIs charge token usage, SoT may lead to higher costs. To address this, one can tune the number of parallel API requests (by expanding multiple points in a single API call), or use prompt tuning to design shorter SoT prompts (see App. H).\n\n**Data-centric efficiency optimization.** While data-centric engineering for improving answer _quality_ (Zha et al., 2023; HazyResearch, 2023) is gaining popularity, its potential for _inference efficiency_ is not explored yet. SoT is the first attempt. As LLM capabilities and the amount of LLM-generated data are growing rapidly, data-centric techniques could become more useful in the future. We look forward to more explorations to unlock the full potential of data-centric efficiency optimization.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe thank Sergey Yekhanin (Microsoft Research), and Tianji Wu (Infinigence AI) for their support and suggestions on the work.

Therefore, we can use a simple regular expression (\\(\\backslash\\)d+)\\(\\backslash.\\backslash\\)s?([\\(\\backslash\\)s\\(\\backslash\\)S]+?)(?=\\(\\backslash\\)n|\\(\\backslash\\)n*$) to extract point indexes and point skeletons from the skeleton response.\n\nWe find that GPT-4 can work well without the two demonstrations in the skeleton prompt. Therefore, we do not include the two demonstrations for GPT-4 (Prompt 1). For all other models, the two demonstrations are included, as shown in Prompt 3.\n\n**Point-expanding prompt template.** It describes the point-expanding task and provides a partial answer. We also provide instructions \"Write it **very shortly** in 1\\(\\sim\\)2 sentence\" so that the LLMs keep the answers concise. Unlike the skeleton prompt template, we find that demonstrations are not necessary to get reasonable results.\n\nWe find that Claude and GPT-4 follows the instruction \"Write it **very shortly** in 1\\(\\sim\\)2 sentence and do not continue with other points!\" in Prompt 2 very well, so that the answers are very short. Therefore, we delete \"*\"very shortly**\" from the prompt template in Claude and GPT-4.\n\nPartial answer.In the Prompts 1 and 2, we provide partial answers so that LLMs can follow the desired response format better.\n\nWe can put the partial answer at the end of the prompt for the open-source models to continue writing. An implementation detail is that different open-source models have different conversations templates (i.e., different ways to combine user and assistant messages into one string). For example, Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023) uses the string \"USER:\" and \" ASSISTANT.\" for the placeholder \"**[User:]\" and \"**[Role]\" in the Prompts 1 and 2, respectively, while UltraLM (Ding et al., 2023) uses \"User.\" and \"\\(\\langle\\)s\\(\\rangle\\)Assistant:\". We build our open-source model experiments with the help of the FastChat codebase (Zheng et al., 2023), in which the conversation templates of many models are already handled correctly. We implement the conversation templates of OpenChat-13B, StableVicuna-13B, and UltraLM-13B according to their official guides and codes.\n\nFor ChatGPT-3.5, we provide partial answers as a last message in the chat history from the assistant. Note that it is not a documented approach. We find it works well in most cases, in that ChatGPT-3.5continues the texts from the provided partial answer. However, in some rare cases, ChatGPT-3.5 repeats the provided partial answers.\n\nFor Claude over Slack, there is no obvious way to give the API a partial answer. We resort to modifying the prompt template slightly by adding\n\n_Please start your answer from \"{partial answer}\" and do not output other things before that_\n\nat the end. We find that Claude understands and obeys it well. For GPT-4, we also take this approach.\n\nSystem Message.We do not include the system message in the prompts for open-source models except LLaMA2.\n\nThe partial answer, \"**very shortly**\", and the 2-shot demonstrations discussed above are the only differences between the prompts we used across all models and all evaluations.\n\n### Supporting Multi-Round Conversation\n\nTo use SoT in a multi-round conversation, we can just put the question and the final aggregated answer in the history, removing all the SoT prompts. In this way, using SoT in one conversation round will not introduce additional prefill cost in future rounds.\n\n## Appendix C Implementation Details of Skeleton-of-Thought with Router\n\n### Prompting Router\n\nWe use Prompt 4 for querying GPT-4 as the router. If the answer is \"A\" (i.e., the question can be answered in a list of independent points), we will use SoT. Otherwise, if the answer is \"B\" (i.e., the answer is in a list of points but they depend on each other) or \"C\" (i.e., the answer should _not_ be in a list of points), SoT is not suitable and we will fall back to normal decoding.\n\n### Trained Router\n\nWe tackle the routing problem as a sequence classification task. We first annotate the LIMA training set (Zhou et al., 2023), and then fine-tune a RoBERTa model (Liu et al., 2019) using the labeled data. Finally, we apply the tuned RoBERTa as the router on Vicuna-80 and WizardLM. We detail the steps in the following.\n\n#### c.2.1 Annotation Process\n\nIn the classification task, a label of 1 (positive) indicates that this question can be answered with SoT, while a label of 0 (negative) suggests that using the normal generation mode is more suitable. We annotate the LIMA training set, which consists of 1,030 Q&As sourced from three community webpages: Stack Exchange, wikiHow, and the Pushshift Reddit. We also annotate the Vicuna-80 and WizardLM datasets for evaluation.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:21]\n\nthe token overhead. Therefore, we did not employ this approach in this work and leave it to future work.\n\n## Appendix D Related Work (Expanded)\n\n### Efficient LLMs\n\nExtensive research has been dedicated to enhancing the throughput and latency of LLM inference. We first discuss model-level architecture design or compression techniques. These techniques change the model and can benefit both the latency and throughput but require finetuning to retain the model quality. Then, we discuss system-level efforts that optimize the computational graph or the assignment and scheduling of the computational graph on computation and storage devices. Most system-level efforts accelerate the prefilling phase or focus on improving the throughput. Finally, we discuss some research efforts that share a similar motivation to ours, namely, addressing the efficiency issue of sequential decoding.\n\nModel-level optimization.Considerable architectural design efforts have emerged to (1) improve the scalability w.r.t. model size by introducing mixture-of-expert inference (Lepikhin et al., 2021; Fedus et al., 2022), (2) address the quadratic complexity w.r.t. input size of attention by designing new attention mechanisms (Kitaev et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020), (3) reduce the memory access and footprint of attention by using multi-query attention (Shazeer, 2019), and so on. However, these methods usually require a substantial re-training cost. The model compression techniques require a smaller amount of fine-tuning by reducing the model complexity of a pre-trained LLM from certain aspects (Ganesh et al., 2021). Representative techniques include quantization (Xiao et al., 2022; Frantar et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2023), the static or dynamic pruning of weights, activation, and attention (Mishra et al., 2021; Zaheer et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2023b), and so on.\n\nZooming out from LLM compression to the whole field of model compression, we can see that model co-design or compression for efficiency has received tremendous attention in the past few years and has grown into large research fields, such as pruning (Han et al., 2015; Wen et al., 2016), quantization (Krishnamoorthi, 2018), factorization (Denton et al., 2014), and neural architecture search (Zoph and Le, 2017; Elsken et al., 2019; Cai et al., 2019). _Different from the model co-design paradigm, SoT is in a \"content co-organization for efficiency\" paradigm for improving the LLM efficiency_. Along with the growth in the LLM capabilities and amount of LLM-generated data, data-level techniques could become important tools in the efficient LLM toolbox.\n\nSystem-level optimization.In the realm of lossless acceleration, considerable efforts have been devoted to addressing the I/O-bound nature of LLMs on modern hardware platforms (Dao et al., 2022). Numerous studies (Dao et al., 2022; Zhai et al., 2022; Ivanov et al., 2021; NVIDIA, 2019) have focused on adjusting the computational graph by fusing and implementing operations in an I/O-friendly way. As a representative method, FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) fuses all operations of one attention into one GPU kernel with spatially tiled computation to reduce the off-chip I/O of the attention map. While FlashAttention can effectively accelerate training and the prefilling phase of inference, it cannot accelerate the decoding phase much (when the batch size is small), as it is the I/O of weights rather than activation or attention map that bottlenecks the decoding phase. For example, when the context length is 64, decoding one token using LLaM-7B needs to load each\n\nFigure 9: **Left: The SoT-R pipeline. Right: A possible approach to further reduce latency at the cost of token overhead.**\n\nof the 7B parameters from the off-chip HBM onto the GPU chip at least once, but only transferring about 20M (0.02B) activation values between the off-chip HBM and GPU chip.\n\nIn order to satisfy Service Level Objectives, serving systems focus on improving the serving throughput under latency constraints. To this end, serving systems (Fang et al., 2021; NVIDIA, 2021; Google, 2021) pack multiple queries together into a batch to improve the hardware utilization. The batching technique has proven highly effective in enhancing throughput, leading to the development of various variants. For example, some work designs methods to decide which queries to batch together (Fang et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2022), while others selectively batch parts of the model to enable fine-grained iteration-level batching (Yu et al., 2022) or multi-task batching (Zhou et al., 2022). Various model parallelism (Lu et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019; Narayanan et al., 2019; Rajbhandari et al., 2020; Narayanan et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021; Zheng et al., 2022) and offloading (Ren et al., 2021; Sheng et al., 2023) techniques have been proposed to maximize the throughput of LLM training or inference. In a nutshell, given the computational graph and device configurations, these techniques optimize the split, assignment, and scheduling of computations, storage, and communications on devices. In addition to the model parallelism and batching techniques, an efficient memory management mechanism for LLM workloads is also an essential feature in the serving systems (Kwon et al., 2023; SenseTime, 2023a;b).\n\nTo sum up, these system-level techniques mainly help with the throughput in training and batched inference. They can be used by SoT to improve the throughput of the batched decoding of multiple segments. This means that _SoT can harness the power of these throughput-oriented techniques and make them help with the end-to-end latency_, offering a new dimension for better trading off latency and throughput in future serving systems.\n\nAnother parallelism perspective to position SoT is that _SoT guides the LLM to adjust the sequential workload to become \"inter-content\" parallelizable_, which differs from the parallelism levels in existing serving systems, including inter-instance (Krizhevsky, 2014; Rajbhandari et al., 2020), inter-operation (Huang et al., 2019; Narayanan et al., 2019; Narayanan et al., 2021), intra-operation (Xu et al., 2021), and inter-token (Li et al., 2021). It may be worthwhile to explore _the integration of SoT into serving systems to maximize the hardware utilization_.\n\nDecoding optimization.One bottleneck for the end-to-end latency lies in the autoregressive decoding phase, where tokens must be generated one by one. Due to the dependency between tokens, the computation of different tokens cannot be parallelized, causing severe under-utilization of GPU. In order to improve the end-to-end decoding latency of a given LLM, speculative decoding methods (Stern et al., 2018; Leviathan et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023a; Gante, 2023; Sun et al., 2023; Miao et al., 2023) propose to use cheaper approaches to generate short candidate token sequences, for example, by sequentially decoding with an assisting model much smaller than the given LLM. Then, they use the LLM to parallelly verify the candidates and keep the prefix sequence that matches the LLM's verification results.\n\nAnother line of work that shares the motivation of addressing the autoregressive efficiency issue is non-autoregressive generation (NAG) methods (Gu et al., 2018; Xiao et al., 2023). NAG methods sample consecutive tokens parallelly, often with the aid of a modified and tuned model. To maintain the answer quality, instead of sampling for one iteration, many NAG methods refine the output parallelly for multiple iterations (Xiao et al., 2023; Santilli et al., 2023).\n\nTo summarize, the speculative decoding methods use assisting models for _letting the LLM conduct parallel verification of consecutive tokens_, and the NAG methods rely on specially designed models, training schemes, or sampling schemes for _the parallel sampling and refinement of consecutive tokens_. In contrast, SoT prompts the LLM itself to plan the contents in a way that permits _the parallel generation of multiple tokens in different segments_. SoT exploits the emerging instruction-following and planning ability of SoTA LLMs rather than relying on specially designed modeling, sampling, and training schemes. This is different from all existing work that targets the autoregressive efficiency issue.\n\n### Prompting Methods for LLMs\n\nIn recent years, the \"pre-train, prompt, and predict\" paradigm has emerged (Liu et al., 2023), which designs prompts comprising task descriptions and (optionally) a few demonstrations to guide pretrained LLMs in generating answers for a wide range of downstream tasks. Researchers found that instruction-tuned LLMs (Brown et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022; Taori et al., 2023) possess a strong ability to (1) generalize to new tasks thanks to the diverse natural language descriptions encountered during instruction tuning, and (2) learn in-context using a few demonstrations without weight tuning.\n\nIn virtue of these abilities, the field has been manually engineering (Brown et al., 2020; Kojima et al., 2022; Shen et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023a), automatic searching (Shin et al., 2020), or continuously tuning (Li and Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021) the prompts for uncovering the capabilities of LLMs on downstream tasks. There are a bunch of prompting methods that improves the reasoning performance of LLMs by designing thinking flows mimicking human reasoning: (1) mimicking the step-by-step or compositional thinking structure (Wei et al., 2022; Kojima et al., 2022; Press et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2023; Besta et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023), (2) designing multiple reasoning paths and their aggregation (Wang et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023c), and (3) using tools for calculation and information retrieval (Chen et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2022; Schick et al., 2023). As a representative example, the Chain-of-Thought prompts largely improve the performance on tasks that require logical reasoning by simply providing a \"Let's think step by step\" (Kojima et al., 2022) instruction or a few demonstrations (Wei et al., 2022). Another topic that arises quite a surge of interests is to prompt LLMs to help finish complex multi-modality task (Shen et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023). For example, HuggingGPT (Shen et al., 2023) design prompts to guide the LLM to generate structural JSON for the orchestration of multi-model execution to finish complex tasks.\n\nTo summarize, the large literature on prompting methods has been aiming at uncovering different capabilities of LLM and improving the answer quality on different downstream tasks. In contrast, _SoT is a first attempt at exploiting the power of prompting to improve efficiency_.\n\n## Appendix E Efficiency Analysis\n\nThis section gives a detailed explanation on why SoT can reduce the overall decoding latency with the same computational resource for local models.\n\nThe vanilla approach processes only one question and decodes the answers sequentially, whereas SoT processes multiple point-expanding requests and the answers in a batch. We focus on the following question: \"Compared to processing only one sequence, how much peak memory overhead and latency increase will be brought by processing a batch of sequences?\"\n\nA typical LLM generative process consists of two phases: (1) the prefilling phase in which the prompt is parsed to generate the key-value cache for further use, and (2) the decoding phase in which tokens are generated one by one in a sequential manner. The decoding phase accounts for the majority of the end-to-end latency, especially when generating a long response. As shown in Table 5, when running Vicuna-7B on NVIDIA A100-80G, the actual computing performance is only 0.31 TLOPS (0.1% utilization) in the decoding phase, compared to 43 TFLOPS (13.8% utilization) during prefilling. The utilization is calculated with respect to the FP165 tensor core peak performance - 312 TFLOPS for NVIDIA-A100. As a result, the latency of decoding only one token is comparable to that of prefilling 128 tokens (40ms). This huge gap in actual computing performance and thereby the latency arises from the fact that all LLM weights need to be loaded onto the GPU chip at least once only for decoding one token, so the decoding is heavily bottlenecked by the I/O of weights and the GPU computation units cannot be well utilized.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c} \\hline \\hline Model & Prefill/Decode Latency (ms) & Prefill/Decode GPU Perf. (TFLOPS) \\\\ \\hline LLaMA-7B & 40 / 2735 & 43 / 0.31 \\\\ LLaMA-13B & 54 / 3725 & 62 / 0.44 \\\\ LLaMA-33B & 100 / 5506 & 85 / 0.75 \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 5: The latency and average GPU performance of the prefilling and decoding phases when inferencing LLMs. The prefilling token length is 128, the decoding token length is 64, and the batch size is 1. The test is run on one NVIDIA A100 GPU.\n\nWhen conducting batched decoding, as the sequence batch size \\(B\\) increases, the latency of decoding one token for each sequence stays roughly the same (Fig. 9(a)), as the amount of LLM weights that needs to be loaded onto the chip does not change. As a result, the GPU computation utilization ( Actual GPU Performance) increases almost linearly as \\(B\\) increases (Fig. 9(b)). In other words, for generating a final answer of length \\(N\\), if we cut the answer into \\(B\\) segments of length \\(N/B\\) and decode them as a batch, we can get a \\(B\\times\\) decoding speed-up compared to sequential decoding. Nevertheless, in practice, as prefilling longer requests brings some overhead, and the lengths of the \\(B\\) segments could be imbalanced, the actual speed-up of the batched point-expanding stage compared with the original prefilling and sequential decoding process is smaller than \\(B\\).\n\nAs for the peak memory overhead, the amount of LLM weights can be one to two orders of magnitude larger than that of all the intermediate activations as long as the prefilling token length is not too large, not to mention that most activations do not need to be saved for back-propagation during inference. Therefore, the LLM weights account for the majority of the memory footprint in our test cases. Consequently, as shown in Fig. 9(c), the peak memory overhead due to the increasing size of the KV cache and activation grows at a slow pace as the batch size \\(B\\) increases. Thanks to the small peak memory overhead, in all of our experiments, we managed to use one GPU to run SoC without seeking help from other peak memory optimization techniques (e.g., quantization (Frantar et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2023), offloading (Sheng et al., 2023)).\n\n## Appendix F Efficiency Profiling\n\nWe run the profiling on the target GPU (NVIDIA A100-80G and NVIDIA RTX 3090) with CUDA 11.7, using the Hugging Face transformer library 4.28.1 and PyTorch 2.0.1. The host of A100-80G has an Intel Xeon Platinum 8358P CPU and 1T memory. The host of RTX 3090 has an Intel Xeon Gold 6246R CPU and 512G memory.\n\nLatency profiling and estimation.For the decoding phase, we denote \\(t_{B}^{D}(k)\\) as the latency of batched decoding the \\(k+1\\)-th token with batch size \\(B\\), where the superscript \\(D\\) stands for \"decode\". For each batch size \\(B=1,\\cdots,16\\) and each context length \\(k=1,\\cdots,1024\\), we use torch.cuda.Event to record the latency of decoding one token. We run each decoding three times continuously and take their geometric mean as \\(\\{t_{B}^{D}(k)\\}_{k=1,\\cdots,1024;B=1,\\cdots,16}\\). For the prefilling phase, we profile the latency of batched prefilling the inputs with token length \\(k\\) in \\(\\operatorname{range}(1,700,10)\\) and batch size \\(B=1,\\cdots,16\\), and denote it as \\(t_{B}^{P}(k)\\), where the superscript \\(P\\) stands for \"prefill\". We run each test seven times continuously, regard the first two times as the warmup tests, and take the geometric mean of the last five times as \\(\\{t_{B}^{P}(k)\\}_{k=1,11,\\cdots,691;B=1,\\cdots,16}\\). Once we get the latency profiling table, given a request with \\(l_{i}\\) tokens and the decoding batch size \\(B\\), the latency of generating \\(l_{o}\\) tokens can be estimated as:\n\n\\[T(l_{i},l_{o},B)=\\tilde{t}_{B}^{P}(l_{i})+\\sum_{k=l_{i}}^{l_{i}+l_{o}-1}t_{B}^ {D}(k), \\tag{1}\\]\n\nwhere the subscripts \\(i\\) and \\(o\\) stand for \"input\" and \"output\". Note that we only test the prefilling latency every ten token lengths (i.e., \\(1,11,21,\\cdots\\)) for fast profiling and estimate \\(\\tilde{t}_{B}^{P}(l_{i})\\) by \\(t_{B}^{P}(\\lfloor\\frac{l_{i}}{10}\\rfloor\\times 10+1)\\).\n\nFigure 9: The trends of latency, average GPU performance of decoding one token, and peak memory with respect to the batch size \\(B\\) of sequences. The prefilling token length is 128, and the decoding token length is 64. The test is run on one NVIDIA A100 GPU.\n\nThe SoT decoding process consists of two stages: the skeleton stage and the point-expanding stage. Denoting the token length of the skeleton request and skeleton response as \\(l_{i}^{s}\\) and \\(l_{o}^{s}\\), the token length of the longest point-expanding request and the longest point-expanding response as \\(l_{i}^{pe}\\) and \\(l_{o}^{pe}\\), the number of the points as \\(B\\), we can compute the latency of the skeleton and point-expanding stages as:\n\n\\[L^{s}(l_{i}^{s},l_{o}^{s}) =T(l_{i}^{s},l_{o}^{s},1), \\tag{2}\\] \\[L^{pe}(l_{i}^{pe},l_{o}^{pe},B) =T(l_{i}^{pe},l_{o}^{pe},B). \\tag{3}\\]\n\nUsing the latency profiling table, we can further estimate the average GPU computing performance in FLOPS (i.e., FLOPs per second) of decoding \\(l_{o}\\) tokens with prefilling length \\(l_{i}\\) as\n\n\\[P^{D}(l_{i},l_{o},B)=\\frac{\\sum_{k=l_{i}}^{l_{i}+l_{o}-1}f_{B}^{D }(k)}{\\sum_{k=l_{i}}^{l_{i}+l_{o}-1}t_{B}^{D}(k)}, \\tag{4}\\]\n\nwhere \\(f_{B}^{D}(k)\\) denotes the FLOPs of decoding one token with context length \\(k\\), which is calculated by DeepSpeed's FLOPs profiler 6. Fig. 10b reports the average GPU computing performance during the process of decoding 64 tokens (prefilling length=128), i.e., \\(P^{D}(128,64,B)\\).\n\nFootnote 6: [https://deepspeed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/flops-profiler.html](https://deepspeed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/flops-profiler.html)\n\nMemory profiling and evaluation.To evaluate the peak memory, we use torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated to record the memory consumption of prefilling sequences of different lengths and decoding with different context lengths and a batch size ranging from 1 to 16. Then, we calculate the peak memory of each stage as the maximum value of the prefilling and decoding phases, and calculate the overall peak memory of SoT as the maximum value of the skeleton and point-expanding stages.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:27]\n\nprefilling latency - which is expected - this has negligible impact on the overall latency and thereby the overall speed-up.\n\n#### g.1.3 Efficiency Evaluation on NVIDIA RTX 3090\n\nWe present the SoT speed-ups and latency breakdown on RTX 3090 in Fig. 13. We test the three 7B models, as their FP16-precision version can be run on an RTX 3090 GPU without further peak memory optimization techniques such as weight quantization (Frantar et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2023) or offloading (Sheng et al., 2023). On these three models, SoT can obtain 1.94\\(\\times\\) to 2.40\\(\\times\\) speed-up on average on Vicuna-80.\n\nFor the five question categories that SoT can provide high-quality answers (i.e., _knowledge_, _commonsense_, _generic_, _roleplay_, _counterfactual_), SoT can speed-up the overall answer generation process by 1.96\\(\\times\\) to 2.52\\(\\times\\) in the meantime. Note that for the _math_ category, despite the average speed-up being 1.20\\(\\times\\) by calculating the speed-up across the three math questions, SoT does not reduce the absolute latency of processing the three questions.\n\n#### g.1.4 Actual Latency Testing\n\nThis section reports the actual SoT speed-up on the Vicuna-80 with batch testing (instead of analyzing with pre-made profiling tables), using a single NVIDIA A100 GPU. We test the actual end-to-end latency of the SoT and normal decoding with the 9 open-source models. For each model, we run the speed-up test for five times and plot the box in Fig. 14.\n\nFigure 12: The latency breakdown of SoT and normal generations on the Vicuna-80 dataset. For open-source models, the latency breakdown of the prefilling and decoding phases is shown in different colors. For API-based models, we do not record such latency breakdown information; the bar labeled as \u201c(decode)\u201d indicates the overall latency of prefilling and decoding phases.\n\nFigure 13: The latency breakdown of SoT and normal decoding on the Vicuna-80 dataset. The average speed-up across questions are also marked on the figure.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:29]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:30]\n\n## Appendix H Overhead of SoT in Different Scenarios\n\nDespite the optimizations made to the decoding phase, SoT brings overhead to the prefilling phase as the model needs to handle additional SoT prompts. Table 6 reports SoT's prefilling overhead for the API-based models. These statistics are averaged across the Vicuna-80 questions that are suitable for SoT (according to our manual annotation). We can see that SoT significantly increases the number of prefilling tokens. This is because that SoT issues an independent point-expanding request for each point, with the average number of points being 6.8 on Vicuna-80 dataset across all evaluated models. Consequently, the APIs need to prefill the point-expanding request multiple times.\n\nFigure 21: Speed-ups of SoT and SoT-R on different question categories of the WizardLM dataset.\n\nFigure 20: Speed-ups of SoT-R on different question categories of WizardLM datasetWhen using SoT to serve the open-source models, a simple and small trick is to prefill the common prefix of point-expanding requests with a batch size of 1 during Stage 2 (i.e., the point-expanding stage). Table 7 shows the prefilling overhead after applying the trick. Although the ratio is considerably smaller compared to that of the API-based models, this computational overhead remains a concern, especially during periods of high system workload.\n\nThere are some possibilities to further reduce the token and computational overhead that are worth exploring in future work. To name a few: (1) When using SoT in serving systems, we can simply reuse the key-value cache containing the question and skeleton from Stage 1 during Stage 2, rather than re-prefilling them as in a multi-round conversation. (2) Generally, as LLM capabilities continue to evolve and prompt tuning techniques advance (Shin et al., 2020; Li and Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021), the possibility of using much shorter prompts to activate the SoT mode in the future holds promise, which would significantly mitigate the token or computational overhead.\n\n## Appendix I Answer Quality Evaluation\n\n### Skeleton-of-Thought\n\n#### i.1.1 Answer Analysis: Different Models\n\n**Models on which SoT has low net win rates.** We observe two types of reasons for the low net win rates.\n\n_(1) OpenChat-13B, Vicuna-7B V1.1, and LLaMA2-Chat-13B._ For the weak models such as OpenChat-13B and Vicuna-7B V1.1, they are not able to follow the SoT prompts precisely.

It occurs when positively charged particles in a hundred cloud discharge to the negatively charged Earth. The process is still not fully understood, but scientists have been able to estimate how many lightning strikes occur on Earth each day._\n\n_1. The Earth's atmosphere._\n\n_The Earth's atmosphere plays a crucial role in the formation of lightning. It consists of different layers, with the troposphere being the lowest and most active. The troposphere is where most of the weather occurs, and it is where lightning primarily forms. The atmosphere's temperature, humidity, and wind patterns all contribute to the likelihood of a lightning strike._\n\n_Skeleton:_\n\n_2.

Protecting the innocent and fighting villains.I use my powers to defend the defenses and bring justice to those who have been wronged._\n\n_4. Inspired by courage, justice, and selflessness._\n\nThese two issues result in bad net win rates.\n\n_(2) Claude._ For strong models such as Claude, we do not see major issues with SoT's answers except the common issues across all models discussed in SS 3.2.3. We hypothesize that the low net win rates are majorly due to the fact that their normal sequential generation is already very good.\n\n**Models on which SoT has high net win rates.** The models with high net win rates (Vicuna-13B V1.3, StableVicuna-13B, and UltraLM-13B) are between the above two extremes. On one hand, they are good enough to understand SoT prompts. While we observe that they sometimes have the same issues as OpenChat-13B and Vicuna-7B V1.1 discussed before, these issues happen much less frequently. On the other hand, their normal sequential generation performance has a larger room for improvement than Claude and ChatGPT-3.5 so that the benefits from SoT are more visible on these models.\n\n#### 1.1.2 Answer Analysis: Different Question Categories\n\n**Categories on which SoT has low net win rates.**\n\n_(1) Math._ Math questions require step-by-step thinking. Without knowing the previous steps, it is hard to derive the following steps. Chain-of-Thoughts (Kojima et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022) emphasize the importance of expanding the sequential thinking steps to solve these problems successfully. In contrast, SoT requires the models to (a) come up with the skeleton of the solution first and (b) deduce each individual step independently without referring to previous results. Both of these are challenging tasks. Strong models are able to get (a) correct but fail at (b). In the following example, ChatGPT-3.5 gets the skeleton steps correct. However, without knowing the results from the first step, the model starts making mistakes in the second step.7For weaker models, it is hard to even get step (a) correct. For example, as shown below, the third step \"Apply FOIL\" in Vicuna-13B V1.3's SoT solution comes out of nowhere. This makes SoT's solution incorrect (though the solution from the normal generation is also incorrect).\n\n_(2) Fermi._ Similar to math questions, questions in the fermi category require solvers to make assumptions and calculate the answer step-by-step. For example, to answer the question in the figure below, the solver is required to make an assumption about when life began on Earth. In step 4, ChatGPT-3.5 does not know that it has already assumed 3.5 billion years in step 3 and uses the wrong number 4.54 billion in the calculation. In step 5, ChatGPT-3.5 does not know that it has already made the above assumptions and refuses to answer \"due to the uncertainties in estimating the age of the Earth\". In contrast, normal generation is able to create a consistent solution.\n\n**Question:** (Fermi) How many times has the Earth orbited the Sun since the beginning of life? Try to explain your answer. Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step.\n\n**X**: **SoT's answer (ChatGPT-3.5)** (Orange texts are the skeleton.)\n\n1. Estimate the age of the Earth. The age of the Earth is estimated to be around 4.54 billion years, based on radiometric dating of rocks and meteorites\n\n2. Determine when life began on Earth. Life on Earth is estimated to have begun around 3.5 billion years ago, based on the discovery of ancient microfossils.\n\n3. Calculate the number of years since life began. The oldest known fossils suggest that life on Earth began around 3.5 billion years ago. Therefore, the number of years since life began on Earth is approximately 3.5 billion years.\n\n4. Divide the number of years by the length of one orbit. Assuming an orbital period of 365.25 days, the Earth has orbited the Sun approximately 3.45 billion 365.25 12.425,000 times since the beginning of life. Unfortunately, it is impossible to give a specific number for the amount of times the Earth has orbited the Sun since the beginning of life due to the uncertainties in estimating the age of the Earth and when life first emerged.\n\n**Normal answer (ChatGPT-3.5)**\n\nThe beginning of life on Earth is estimated to have occurred around 3.5 to 4 billion years ago. Since that time, the Earth has been orbiting the Sun continuously.\n\nThe length of one orbit, or one year, is approximately 365.25 days. This means that the Earth completes one fall orbit around the Sun every 365.25 days.\n\nTo calculate the number of times the Earth has orbited the Sun since the beginning of life, we can divide the total number of days by the length of one orbit:\n\nTotal number of days since the beginning of life = (3.5 billion years) x (365 days per year) = 1.2775 tillion days\n\nNumber of orbits = (1.2775 tillion days) / (365.25 days per orbit) = 3.5 billion orbits\n\nTherefore, the Earth has orbited the Sun approximately 3.5 billion times since the beginning of life.\n\nAs the following example shows, there are also cases when SoT solves the question (with minor computation errors) by embedding the computation steps in the skeleton directly in the skeleton stage. The point-expanding stage will then add little content (except some undesired repetition of the following skeletons occasionally). This happens both on small/weak models and large/powerful models. Although this behavior is not what we originally expect, it sheds light on a promising direction for making SoT a general framework: in the problem where step-by-step thinking is needed, the SoT model automatically falls back to the sequential generation mode by outputting the complete answer in the skeleton stage and skipping the point-expanding stage. Future work needs to be done to control and encourage this behavior better.\n\n**Question:** (Fermi) How many times does the average human blink in a lifetime? Try to explain your answer. Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step.\n\n**SoT's answer (Vicuna-7b V1.1)** (Orange texts are the skeleton.)\n\n1. The average human blinks 12.15 times per minute.\n\n2. There are 60 minutes in an hour.\n\n3. Therefore, the average human blinks 60 x 12.15 720-900 times per hour.\n\n4. There are 24 hours in a day.Therefore, the average human blinks 720-900 x 24 = 17,520-22,400 times per day.This translates to blinking approximately 50-65 times per hour, which is a significant portion of the day.\n\n6. There are 365 days in a year.Therefore, the average human blinks 17,520-22,400 x 365 = 5,857,600-8,124,000 times per year.\n\n7. Therefore, the average human blinks 17,520-22,400 x 365 = 5,857,600-8,124,000 times per year.\n\n8. The human lifespan is typically 70-80 years.Therefore, the average human blinks 80,000-112,000 times in their lifetime.\n\n9. Therefore, the average human blinks 5,857,600-8,124,000/700 = 80,000-112,000 times in their lifetime.\n\n**Normal answer (Vicuna-7b V1.1)**\n\nThe average human blinks about 12-15 times per minute, which translates to about 18,200 to 20,400 blinks per day. Over the course of a lifetime, the number of blinks is estimated to be around 7,500,000 to 500,000.\n\nBlinking is a reflexive action that helps to keep the eyes moist and comfortable, as well as to protect the eyes from dust and other foreign particles. The frequency of blinking can vary depending on a variety of factors, including age, health, and environmental conditions. For example, people who work in dusty or dry environments may bink more frequently than those who work in a clean, moist environment.\n\nOver the course of a lifetime, the average person will spend approximately 27,375 days or 700,000 hours awake. This means that the majority of the time spent blinking will occur in the first few decades of life, with the frequency of blinking gradually decreasing as people age.\n\nIt is important to note that there is a significant amount of individual variation in the frequency of blinking. Some people may bink more or less than the average, depending on a variety of factors such as age, health, and environmental conditions. Additionally, blinking patterns can be affected by factors such as stress, fatigue, and certain medical conditions.\n\n_(3) Coding._ While in most cases, the models are able to decompose the coding problem into smaller tasks in the skeleton stage, the generation quality during the point-expanding stage is bad, potentially due to the fact that we did not carefully craft a special point-expanding prompt for coding. The failure cases can be grouped into two cases. (a) In some cases, the model only generates a description of how implementation can be done without giving the code.\n\n**Question: (Coding) Develop a C++ program that reads a text file line by line and counts the number of occurrences of a specific word in the file.**\n\n**SoT's answer (Claude) (\\(\\mathrm{Orange}\\) texts are the skeleton.)**\n\n1. Open file stream by declaring an fifteran object and using the open() method to open the file in read mode.\n\n2. Read line by line from the file stream into a string using germline.).\n\n3. Print word by searching each line for the target word using string:find and keeping track of matches.\n\n4. Increment counter by one each time the specified word is encountered in the current line.\n\n5. Close file\n\nThe file stream should be closed after finishing reading the file to free up resources. This can be done by calling the close() method on the file stream object.\n\nThis might be due to the fact that the powerful models (e.g., Claude) follow the point-expanding prompt \"Write it **very shortly** in 1\\(\\sim\\)2 sentence\" precisely. Better prompts tailed to coding could help. (b) In some other cases, the model tends to generate the complete code repeatedly in several points.\n\n**Question: (Coding) Develop a C++ program that reads a text file line by line and counts the number of occurrences of a specific word in the file.**\n\n**SoT's answer (OpenChat-13B) (\\(\\mathrm{Orange}\\) texts are the skeleton.)**\n\n1. Read file line by line.\n\n2. Store line in a container.\n\n3. Count occurrences of specific word.\n\n\"cpp\"\n\n_inner texts are omitted._\n\n...\n\nThis code uses the C++ standard library to read a text file line by line, store each line in a container, and count the occurrences of a specific word. The results are printed.\n\n4. Print results.\n\nHere's the C++ program that reads a text file line by line and counts the number of occurrences of a specific word in the file.\n\n\"cpp\"\n\n_inner texts are omitted._\n\n...\n\nPlease note that this is a very basic implementation. You may need to adjust it depending on your specific requirements.\n\nThis problem might also be alleviated by prompts that explicitly tell the model to only generate a \"code snippet\" in each skeleton point.\n\nAlthough better prompt engineering could lead to better results, we expect that SoT is not suitable for the coding questions in Vicuna-80. The reason is that the solutions to the problems in Vicuna-80 are usually in a few lines with strong dependencies between each other. Without knowing the previously defined variable names or imported libraries, it is hard (or even impossible) to implement the subsequent code correctly. As a consequence, generating different parts of the answers in parallel is not suitable here. Similar to the math questions, automatically falling back to outputting all the code in the skeleton stage and not triggering the point-expanding stage might be more suitable for answering this question type.\n\nHowever, we expect that SoT could be helpful for larger coding tasks that involve multiple modules (e.g., functions, classes). The skeleton stage could be in charge of defining the interfaces between different modules (e.g., functionalities, names, parameters, return types). The point-expanding stage could be in charge of implementing these modules or using these modules to complete the final task, which can be done in parallel. This mimics the common practice in software engineering.\n\n_(4) Writing._ The writing questions usually ask for an email, a blog post, or a review in a given scenario. In the detailed evaluation output from FastChat and LLMZoo metrics, the major and common complaint is that SoT's answers are (slightly) less detailed. This could potentially be improved by point-expanding prompts that request more details.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:37]\n\n**Question: (Counterfactual) What if the Internet had been invented during the Renaissance period?**\n\n**SoT's answer (ChatGPT-3.5)** (Orange texts are the skeleton.)\n\n1. Advancements in communication: The invention of the Internet during the Renaissance period would have revolutionized communication, allowing for faster and more efficient exchange of ideas and information across vast distances.\n\n2. Increased access to knowledge. The invention of the printing press during the Renaissance period already allowed for greater access to knowledge, but the internet would have revolutionized this even further by providing instantaneous access to information from all over the world.\n\n3. Improved dissemination of ideas: If the internet had been invented during the Renaissance period, the spread of ideas and knowledge would have been much faster and widespread than it was at the time. This could have led to a faster progression of scientific and artistic innovations.\n\n4. Impact on art and literature. The invention of the internet during the Renaissance period would have revolutionized the way art and literature are created, shared, and consumed, leading to a more diverse and globally-influenced artistic and literary scene.\n\n5. Potential for global trade.The invention of the internet during the Renaissance period would have greatly expanded global trade opportunities, allowing for easier communication and collaboration between merchants and traders across continents.\n\n6. Influence on political and social structures: The invention of the internet during the Renaissance period could have led to significant changes in political and social structures, allowing for greater democratization and communication among people from different regions and classes.\n\n**Normal answer (ChatGPT-3.5)**\n\nIf the internet had been invented during the Renaissance period, it would have had a significant impact on the way people communicated, shared ideas, and gained knowledge. The Renaissance was a time of great intellectual and artistic growth, and the internet would have facilitated the spread of these ideas and innovations.\n\nScholars and artists would have been able to share their work more easily, and people from different parts of the world would have been able to connect and collaborate more easily. The Internet would have also made it easier to access information, which could have accelerated the pace of scientific and technological advancements.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the infrastructure required for the Internet to exist did not exist during the Renaissance period. There were no telecommunications networks or electricity grids, so the idea of the Internet would have been impossible to realize. Nonetheless, it's interesting to think about how the Renaissance might have been different if the Internet had existed at that time.\n\n**Question:** (Knowledge) What are some potential implications of using a single-use plastic bottle versus a reusable bottle on both the environment and human health?\n\n**SoT's answer (ChatGPT-3.5)** (Orange texts are the skeleton.)\n\n1. Single-use plastic waste. Single-use plastic bottles contribute to the massive amount of plastic waste that ends up in landfills and oceans, harming wildlife and ecosystems.\n\n2. Pollution of waterways. Single-use plastic bottles contribute to the pollution of waterways, as they often end up in rivers, lakes, and oceans, causing harm to aquatic life and the overall ecosystem.\n\n3. Jarmful chemicals leaching. Single-use paste bottles may release harmful chemicals such as bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates into the water or liquify the combat, posing a risk to human health.\n\n4. Greenhouse gas emission: The production and disposal of single-use plastic bottles contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. Using a reusable bottle reduces the need for constant production and disposal, therefore reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n5. Microplastic ingestion. Single-use plastic bottles contribute to the accumulation of microplastics in the environment, which can be ingested by humans through food and water, leading to potential health risks.\n\n6. Increased risk of disease. Single-use plastic bottles can harbor harmful bacteria, leading to an increased risk of disease if not disposed of property. Reusable bottles, when cleaned regularly, pose a lower risk.\n\n**Normal answer (ChatGPT-3.5)**\n\nUsing a single-use plastic bottle has significant implications on the environment and human health.\n\nEnvironmental implications:\n\n1. Plastic pollution. Single-use plastic bottles are one of the major contributors to plastic pollution in oceans and landfills. They take hundreds of years to decompose, and during that time, they release toxic chemicals and microplastics into the environment.\n\n2. Carbon emissions: Manufacturing and transporting single-use plastic bottles require a significant amount of energy and resources, which contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.\n\n3. Natural resource depletion: The production of single-use plastic bottles requires large amounts of water and oil, which are finite resources.\n\nHealth implications:\n\n1. Chemical exposure: Single-use plastic bottles contain chemicals such as Bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates, which can leach into the water and pose a risk to human health.\n\n2. Microplastics ingestion: When plastic bottles break down, they release microplastics, which can enter the food chain and be ingested by humans.\n\nUsing a reusable bottle, on the other hand, has a positive impact on the environment and human health.\n\nEnvironmental benefits:\n\n1. Reduced plastic waste: Reusable bottles significantly reduce the amount of plastic waste generated.\n\n2. Lower carbon emissions: Reusable bottles have a lower carbon footprint as they can be used multiple times.\n\n3. Reduced resource depletion: The production of reusable bottles requires fewer resources than single-use plastic bottles. Health benefits:\n\n1. Chemical-free: Reusable bottles are typically made from materials that are free from harmful chemicals, reducing the risk of chemical exposure.\n\n2. Reduced microplastics: Reusable bottles do not break down easily, reducing the release of microplastics into the environment.\n\nOverall, using a reusable bottle is a more sustainable and healthier option than using a single-use plastic bottle.\n\n**Question:** (Common sense) How can you determine if a person is genuinely interested in a conversation or simply being polite?\n\n**SoT's answer (ChatGPT-3.5)** (Orange texts are the skeleton.)\n\n1. My situation to body language. Notice if their posture is open or closed, if they are facing towards you or away, and if they are fledging or relaxed. These can all indicate their level of interest in the conversation.\n\n2. Listen for engaged responses. If the person is genuinely interested in the conversation, they will respond with thoughtful and relevant comments or questions rather than short, generic responses.\n\n3. Observe eye contact if the person maintains steady eye contact and their gaze is focused on you, they are likely genuinely interested in the conversation. On the other hand, if they frequently look away or seem distracted, they may just be being polite.\n\n4. Lock for follow-up questions. If the person asks follow-up questions and seems genuinely interested in what you're saying, then they are likely interested in the conversation and not just being polite.\n\n5. Notice tone of voice. A person who is genuinely interested in a conversation will often have a more enthusiastic and animated tone of voice, compared to someone who is simply being polite and giving short, monotone responses.\n\n**Normal answer (ChatGPT-3.5)**\n\nAs an AI assistant, I cannot determine a person's true intentions or feelings. However, there are some social cues that can indicate whether a person is genuinely interested in a conversation or not. For example, if they maintain eye contact, lean in, nod there head and ask follow-up questions, it can be a sign that they are engaged in the conversation. On the other hand, if they avoid eye contact, give short or vague responses, or seem distracted, it may indicate that they are not as interested. Ultimately, it's important to remember that everyone has different communication styles, and it can be difficult to accurately interpret someone's intentions without directly asking them.\n\n**Question:** (Generic) How can I improve my time management skills?\n\n**SoT's answer (ChatGPT-3.5)** (Orange texts are the skeleton.)\n\n1. Set clear goals. Setting clear goals is important in improving time management skills as it helps you to focus on what needs to be done and what can be accomplished within a certain timeframe.\n\n2. Priorities tasks. Make a list of tasks and prioritize them based on their importance and deadline. This will help you focus on the most critical tasks and avoid washing time on less important ones.\n\n3. Create a schedule. Creating a schedule helps you allocate time for each task and ensures that you complete them within the allotted time.\n\n4. Minimize distractions. Distractions such as social media, emails, and phone notifications can waste a lot of time. Try to limit them by turning offtifications or setting specific times to check them.\n\n5. Take breaks. Taking breaks can actually improve productivity and help prevent burnout. It's important to schedule short breaks throughout the day to recharge and refocus.\n\n6. Learn to say to try. It's important to prioritize you own tasks and not take on too much at once. Saying no to requests that don't align with your goals or schedule can help you manage your time more effectively.\n\n7. Delegate tasks. If you have too many tasks to handle, consider delegating some of them to others who can help you.\n\nThis will allow you to focus on more important tasks and manage your time more effectively.\n\n8. Use time management tools.There are a variety of time management tools available, such as calendars, to-do lists, and productivity apps, that can help you stay organized and on track with your tasks.\n\n**Normal answer (ChatGPT-3.5)**\n\nImproving time management skills can be a challenge, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are a few:\n\n1. Set clear goals and priorities: Identify your most important tasks and make sure to complete them first.\n\n2. Make a schedule. Create a schedule that includes your most important tasks and set aside time for them.\n\n3. Use a timer. Set a timer for a specific amount of time to help you stay focused and avoid distractions.\n\n4. Take breaks. Take short breaks throughout the day to help you recharge and avoid burnout.\n\n5. Eliminate distractions: Try to limit distractions as much as possible, such as by turning off your phone or closing your email.\n\n6. Delegate tasks: If possible, delegate tasks to others to free up time for more important activities.\n\nRemember, improving time management skills takes practice and perseverance. Be patient with yourself and keep trying until you find strategies that work well for you.\n\n_(2) Roleplay._ Roleplay questions require LLMs to assume a character and present an introduction or speech to other people. LLMZoo and FastChat metrics usually favor the level of details of SoT when assigning it a better score. Similar to the writing category discussed before, SoT's answers could be even better if the skeleton points are removed from the answer.\n\n**Question:** (Roleplay) How would you introduce yourself as a medieval knight at a royal banquet?\n\n**SoT's answer (Claude)** (Orange texts are the skeleton.)\n\n1. Name and house. My name is Sir Percival of Camelet, knight of the Round Table and protective of King Arthur's realm.\n\n2. Lands and titles. I hold fieddom over the lands of Westmarch and Ravenshire, and bear the titles of Baron of the Western Marches and Knight of the Ravens.\n\n3. Military fieds. I have led my men to great victories against the kingdom's enemies, winning many battles through strength of arms and tactical cunning.\n\n4. Allegance to king. I pledge my sweed, my loyalty, and my life to serve and protect my noble king and this great kingdom.\n\n5. Request to join table. Your Highness, it would be the greatest honor to join your called table and share in this magnificent feast with my fellow knights and loyal subjects.\n\n**Normal answer (Claude)**\n\nGreetings, your majously and honored guests. I am Sir Claude, a knight in service of the king. I hail from the province of Assistation, where I was trained in the knightly virtues of chivalry, courage and courtesy. Though I am but a humble knight, I shall endeavor to serve you and this kingdom with all the strength and valor I possess. I thank you for allowing me to join you at this royal feast, and hope only that my conduct brings further honor to my lege and this noble court. Please let me know if I can be of any service during the celebrations, as it would be my honor to assist you in any way.\n\n#### i.1.3 Answer Analysis: Different Metrics\n\n**Metrics on which SoT has low net win rates.**\n\n_(1) Coherence._ In the prompt of LLMZoo evaluation, coherence is defined as \"The response should be coherent and flow logically from one point to the next that is easy to read and understand without major gaps or inconsistencies. The more coherent they are, the better.\" SoT's answer is structured in a list of points. It is suitable for some questions but not all. For example, in the questions that requireLLMs to write a passage, email, or script, the introduction and conclusion paragraphs are usually missing, and the answers usually lack transition sentences between consecutive points. These make the answers less coherent. Below is one example from Claude.\n\n**Question: Write a script for a YouTube video exploring the history and cultural significance of jazz.**\n\n**SoT's answer (Claude)** (Orange texts are the skeleton.)\n\n1. Origins. Jazz originated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries among African Americans in New Orleans, emerging from a combination of African rhythmic traditions, blues, ragine, and other influences.\n\n2. Early jazz lyrics. The early styles of jazz that emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries included ragine, Divisend, and the blues.\n\n3. Jazz age. The Jazz age was the period during the 1930s when jazz music and dance styles like the Charleston became popular cultural phenomena in American and European society.\n\n4. Hebrew era. Bebbo emerged in the early 1940s with artists like Dizzy Gillepeig and Charlie Parker experimenting with faster tempos, complex chord changes, and unpredictable melodic phrasing.\n\n5. Cool jazz. Emerging in the late 1940s and early 1950s, cool jazz was a more subdued, mellow style that broke from the high-energy virtuotic improvisation of bebop.\n\n6. Free jazz emerged in the late 1950s and 1960s as musicians explored free improvisation and tonality, moving away from traditional jazz structures.\n\n7. Peixin. Jazz. Major jazz artists such as Mike Davis and Herbie Hancock began experimenting with combining elements of rock, fruit, and electronic music in the 1970s, resulting in the emergence of the subfigure known as fusion jazz.\n\n8. Jazz festivals. Jazz festivals emerged in the 1950s and 1960s as a way to celebrate jazz music, with famous early festivals like the Newport Jazz Festival bringing thousands of fans together to hear top performers.\n\n9. Jazz instruments. The prompt, saxophone, piano, double bass, and drum set are some of the key instruments commonly used in jazz.\n\n10. Influential musicians include Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and many others who pioneered new styles and techniques.\n\n11. Lepacy and impact. Jazz has left an indelible mark on music and culture over the past century, influencing countless artists and genres while spreading the spirit of improvisation and freedom across the globe.\n\n**Normal answer (Claude)**\n\nHere is a draft script for a YouTube video exploring the history and cultural significance of jazz:\n\nIntroduction\n\nHey everyone! Welcome to my channel. In today's video, we're going to be exploring the history and cultural impact of one of America's original art forms - jazz music.\n\nJazz Origins\n\nIazz grew out of the African American communities in the southern United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was influenced by a combination of African and European musical traditions. Some key elements that fed into early jazz fielded bases, ragine, spirituals, work songs, field holders, and brass hand music.\n\nNew Orleans is considered the birthplace of jazz, emerging around the turn of the 20th century. The city was a melting port of cultures and musical styles. Musicians mixed improvisation, synocquoted rhythms, bent notes and a loose ensemble playing style to create a new genre that became known as jazz.\n\nEarly jazz greats like Buddy Boden, Jelly Roll Morton and Sidney Becht began fusing these various influences into the distinct jazz sound. As the music spread via travel and recordings in the 1910s, jazz contributed listeners and began to evolve into different styles.\n\nJazz Styles Europe\n\nIn the 1920s, jazz expanded out from New Orleans and Chicago emerged as a hotspot. Louis Armstrong's innovative solos and expressive phrasing became influential. The swing style also developed during the 1930s and 40s, propelled by star big bands and dance.\n\nBelow are in the 1940s with solosits like Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillepeig exploring new levels of harmonic and rhythmic complexity. In the 50s and 60s, jazz expanded into new fusions like cool jazz, hard hop, free jazz, modal jazz and soul jazz. Artists used jazz to express their unique regional, social and political identities.\n\nCultural Significance\n\nOver the decades, jazz has become woven into the fabric of American society. It is equated with many values and ideals like individuals, freedom, spontaneity, innovation and social harmony.\n\nJazz was associated with breaking down barriers between races, classes and genres. It represented modernism and urban culture. Musicians like Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington became some of the first widely popular African American artists.\n\nJazz also spend American culture and values abroad through performances, radio and film. It influenced music around the world and became a truly global art form.\n\nToday jazz continues to thrive and evolve both in the U.S. and internationally. Its history and sounds reflect the diversity of both American and global cultures. From its folk roots, jazz has become a sophisticated art music that retains its spirit of freedom and improvisation.\n\nConclusion\n\nThat covers some of the key points in the history and cultural impact of jazz music. Let me know in the comments about your favorite jazz styles and musicians! Be sure to like and subscribe. See you next time.\n\nWhile the content of SoT's answer is good, it reads less fluent for the purpose of a YouTube script.\n\n_(2) Immersion._ In the prompt of LLMZoo evaluation, immersion is defined as \"the response should act like the assigned role using the tone, manner, and vocabulary the role would use. The more assistant-like tones, the worse. The more in-character, the better.\" The way that SoT breaks the answers into a list makes its answer less in-character. Therefore, SoT receives a lower immersion score. Here is one example.\n\nAgain, while the answer from SoT covers sufficient aspects and details, it reads rather stiffly. The normal answer, in contrast, has the opening sentence \"Bonjour honored judges. Today I present to you my signature dish...\" and the conclusion statement \"So tell me honored judges, will my poulet a la Claude earn your coveted approval?...\" which reads more like a casual talk from a chef.\n\n**Metrics on which SoT has high net win rates.**\n\n_(1) Diversity._ In the prompt of LLMZoo evaluation, diversity is defined as \"The response should be comprehensive and provide a range of information that is not limited to a single perspective. More perspectives are better.\" The skeleton stage in SoT encourages LLMs to think from multiple perspectives. Therefore, SoT's answers tend to have better diversity. Below is one example showing that SoT's answer has better diversity.\n\nSoT answers the question from five aspects, whereas the normal answer only mentions one aspect.\n\n_(2) Relevance._ In the prompt of LLMZoo evaluation, relevance is defined as \"The response should be closely related to the question and answer the question accurately with sufficient details without repetition or redundancy. The more relevant they are, the better.\" In the skeleton stage, LLMs are forced to propose several points around the question; and in the point-expanding stage, LLMs are required to only discuss these points. Therefore, answers from SoT tend to have better relevance. One typical example is shown below.\n\n**Question:** **Why do some people enjoy the sensation of being scared, such as by watching horror movies or going on roller coasters, while others avoid these experiences?**\n\n**SoT's answer (ChatGPT-3.5)** (Orange texts are the skeleton.)\n\n1. Neurological differences: Some people enjoy the sensation of being scared due to the release of adrenaline and dopamine in the brain, while others may have a lower threshold for fear due to differences in their amygdala and prefrontal cortex.\n\n2. Psychological factors: Some people may enjoy the sensation of being scared because it can provide a sense of excitement, thrill, and a temporary escape from the mundane aspects of everyday life. On the other hand, others may avoid these experiences due to past trauma or anxiety.\n\n3. Developmental experiences: Individuals who had negative experiences with fear during childhood, such as trauma or abuse, may avoid scary situations as adults, while those who had positive experiences with fear may seek out these experiences.\n\n4. Cultural influences: Some cultures place a greater emphasis on seeking excitement and thrill, while others may prioritize safety and security, which can impact whether individuals enjoy scary experiences or avoid them.\n\n5. Genetics: Research has suggested that some individuals may have a genetic predisposition towards seeking out thrilling or risky experiences, which may include enjoying the sensation of being scared.\n\n**Normal answer (ChatGPT-3.5)**\n\nThe enjoyment of being scared is a complex psychological phenomenon. Some people may enjoy the adrenaline rush that comes with being scared, while others may enjoy the feeling of being able to conquer their fears. Additionally, some people may be more naturally inclined to seek out new experiences and sensations, including those that are scary or thrilling. On the other hand, some people may be more risk-averse or may have had negative experiences with fear or anxiety in the past, which could make them more likely to avoid scary experiences. Ultimately, the reasons why some people enjoy being scared while others do not are likely to be influenced by a range of factors, including personality, past experiences, and individual preferences.\n\nIn the answer from the normal generation, the first two sentences provide little information in answering the question, and the last sentence only gives keywords such as \"personality, past experiences, and individual preferences\" without providing concrete explanations to each. In contrast,SoT's answer is well-structured into five reasons with sufficient explanations and it does not waste space in irrelevant contents.\n\n### Skeleton-of-Thought with Router\n\nFig. 22 shows net win rates of SoT on Vicuna-80 dataset with LLMZoo metrics, and Fig. 23 shows net win rates of SoT on WizardLM dataset with FastChat metrics. The key takeaways are: (1) In both cases, SoT-R achieves similar or better quality than SoT, and the net win rates of SoT-R are usually non-negative. This indicates that SoT-R falls back to normal decoding on the right question categories. (2) On the WizardLM dataset, we see that the trained router has better performance than the prompting router in most cases. This is reasonable, as the prompting router is limited by the capability of GPT-4, whereas the trained router is dedicated to this task. (3) Sometimes, our routers can even achieve better performance than humans.\n\n### ChatGPT-3.5 as the Judge\n\nIn this section, we provide quality evaluation results with ChatGPT-3.5 as the judge in FastChat and LLMZoo metrics. Note that as prior work (e.g., [11]) shows, GPT-4-based evaluation usually aligns with human better than ChatGPT-3.5. Therefore, readers should refer to the results in the main paper (with GPT-4 as the judge) for a more accurate view of the performance of SoT. However, the takeaway messages from ChatGPT-3.5 are similar to the ones from GPT-4.\n\nFigure 23: Net win rates of SoT and SoT-R on different question categories of WizardLM dataset using the general quality metric from FastChat. SoT-R correctly falls back to normal decoding on questions where SoT is not suitable.\n\nFigure 22: Net win rates of SoT and SoT-R on different question categories of Vicuna-80 dataset using the general quality metric from LLMZoo. Blue dots are from Fig. 5b. SoT-R correctly falls back to normal decoding on questions where SoT is not suitable.\n\n#### i.3.1 Overall Quality\n\nIn Fig. 24, we show the win/tie/lose rates (the percentage of the cases when SoT wins/ties/loses compared to normal generation) across all models and questions using the two metrics from FastChat and LLMZoo that capture the general quality of the answers. We notice a discrepancy between the two metrics on when SoT is strictly better than the baseline (50.2% v.s. 12.4%). Despite that, the two metrics agree that SoT is not worse than the baseline in more than 76% of the cases. For FastChat metric, we also show the rates excluding math and coding questions that SoT is not suitable for (see SS 3.2.3); SoT is not worse than the baseline in more than 89% of the cases. _This result suggests that the answers of SoT maintain good quality._\n\n#### i.3.2 Quality Breakdown: Question Categories\n\nNext, we investigate how SoT performs on different question categories. We compute _net win rates_ (win rates minus lose rates) across all question categories in Fig. 25. Similar to Fig. 24, we see that LLMZoo tends to be more optimistic about the quality of SoT than FastChat. Nevertheless, the conclusions are consistent: SoT performs relatively _well_ on generic, common-sense, knowledge, roleplay, and counterfactual. SoT performs relatively _badly_ on writing, fermi, math, and coding.\n\n#### i.3.3 Quality Breakdown: Models\n\nNext, we investigate how SoT performs on different models. We compute net win rates across all models in Fig. 26. Again, we see that the two general metrics from FastChat and LLMZoo have different absolute values but similar rankings. In particular, both metrics agree that OpenChat-13B, Vicuna-7B V1.1, Claude, ChatGPT-3.5 have _low_ net win rates, whereas Vicuna-13B V1.3, StableVicuna-13B, and UltraLM-13B have _high_ net win rates.\n\n#### i.3.4 Quality Breakdown: Question Categories and Models\n\nIn the main text, we analyze how question categories and models affect SoT's answer quality _independently_. Here, we show their joint effect. For each model and question category, we compute the net win rates. The results are in Fig. 27.\n\nFigure 24: Win/tie/lose rates of SoT v.s. normal generation using \u201cgeneral\u201d metrics from FastChat and LLMZoo. SoT performs better than or equal to normal generation in around 80% of cases. (Evaluated using ChatGPT-3.5 as the judge.)\n\nFigure 25: Net win rates of SoT on different question categories. (Evaluated using ChatGPT-3.5 as the judge.)\n\n#### i.3.5 Quality Breakdown: Metrics\n\nAll previous evaluations use metrics about the general quality of the answer. In Fig. 28, we show more detailed metrics from LLMZoo to reveal in which aspects SoT can improve or hurt the answer quality. On average, we can see that SoT improves the diversity and relevance while hurting the immersion and coherence.\n\nFigure 28: Win/tie/lose rates of SoT v.s. normal generations using metrics from LLMZoo. SoT performs well on diversity and relevance, and relatively worse on coherence and immersion. (Evaluated using ChatGPT-3.5 as the judge.)\n\nFigure 26: Net win rates of SoT on different models. (Evaluated using ChatGPT-3.5 as the judge.)\n\nFigure 27: Net win rates of different models and question categories.

This variant utilizes a hierarchical representation of the chain of thought, resembling a tree-like structure. The tree structure provides a clear and organized way to capture the flow of reasoning and the relationships between different points or ideas [REF4].\n\nIn the tree structure variant of XoT, the reasoning process consists of two main stages: the skeleton stage and the point-expanding stage [REF4]. In the skeleton stage, the XoT system assembles a skeleton request using a skeleton prompt template. This template guides the Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a concise skeleton of the answer. The skeleton response is then extracted, and the relevant points are identified [REF4].\n\nOnce the skeleton is obtained, the point-expanding stage begins. Each point in the skeleton is expanded in parallel by the LLM. For each point, a point-expanding request is constructed using a point-expanding prompt template. This template provides the necessary context and instructions for the LLM to generate a detailed explanation or elaboration for the point [REF4].\n\nThe tree structure variant of XoT has shown promising results in various scenarios. In terms of efficiency and overhead, it has been observed that XoT can effectively reduce latency and enhance GPU utilization, especially in scenarios with an unsaturated number of concurrent queries [REF1]. This makes it suitable for edge-side applications with a single user or centralized services during periods with unsaturated user requests and underutilized computing capacity [REF1].\n\nFurthermore, the tree structure variant of XoT has been applied to solve a wide range of mathematical and logical problems. These include equation solving, polynomial factoring, 3SAT, and puzzles like Sudoku [REF2]. By combining rule-based checkers and neural network-powered systems, XoT allows for the explicit encoding of prior knowledge into the reasoning process [REF2]. Additionally, a memory module can be used to store the conversation history and other supplemental data, enabling the generation of helpful hints for the LLM [REF2].\n\nWhile the tree structure variant of XoT has demonstrated its effectiveness in certain types of questions, it may not be suitable for all scenarios. For questions that require the LLM to generate passages, emails, or scripts, the tree structure may result in answers that lack coherence and transition sentences between consecutive points [REF3]. In such cases, alternative approaches may be necessary to ensure the overall coherence and flow of the generated content [REF3].\n\nIn summary, the tree structure variant of XoT provides a hierarchical representation of the chain of thought, allowing for a clear and organized flow of reasoning. It has shown promise in terms of efficiency, applicability to mathematical and logical problems, and the ability to generate coherent answers. However, it may not be suitable for all types of questions, particularly those requiring the generation of longer passages or scripts. Further research and exploration are needed to fully understand the strengths and limitations of the tree structure variant of XoT and its potential applications in various domains.", "references_sent_to_gpt": [{"title": "Skeleton-of-thought: Large language models can do parallel decoding", "bibref": "BIBREF14", "authors": [{"first": "Xuefei", "middle": [], "last": "Ning", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Zinan", "middle": [], "last": "Lin", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Zixuan", "middle": [], "last": "Zhou", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Huazhong", "middle": [], "last": "Yang", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Yu", "middle": [], "last": "Wang", "suffix": ""}], "chunk": "Skeleton-of-thought: Large language models can do parallel decoding [SEP] 42\n\fSkeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding\nQuestion:\nHow can you determine if a person is genuinely interested in a conversation or simply\nbeing polite?\nSoT\u2019s answer (ChatGPT-3.5) (Orange texts are the skeleton.)\n 1.

The Policy Gradient based Training Algorithm for the ToT System, as outlined in REF0, provides a foundational approach for training both the ToT Controller and the Prompter agent [REF0]. The ToT Controller, which can be likened to a decision-making entity, guides the reasoning process, while the Prompter agent assists by generating contextually relevant prompts based on the current state of the problem-solving session.\n\nThe tree structure inherent in XoT reasoning is exemplified by the Skeleton-of-Thought (SoT) approach, where a high-level skeleton of the answer is first generated and then expanded upon [REF1]. This mirrors the branching nature of a tree, where the main trunk\u2014the skeleton\u2014branches out into various points that are fleshed out in parallel [REF5]. The efficiency of this method, especially in scenarios with unsaturated concurrent queries, highlights the potential for SoT to enhance throughput and GPU utilization without significant overhead [REF2].\n\nThe tree structure also benefits from the inclusion of backtracking capabilities, allowing the system to recover from errors by revisiting and exploring alternative branches of the tree [REF6]. This is akin to a human problem-solver who, upon reaching a dead-end, retraces their steps to find a new path forward. The flexibility of this approach is crucial for complex problem-solving tasks that may not have a linear path to the solution.\n\nMoreover, the tree structure of XoT reasoning can be adapted to various question types and scenarios. While SoT has shown promise in generating structured answers, it may not be suitable for all types of questions, such as those requiring a more narrative or continuous prose format [REF7]. This indicates the need for further refinement of the tree structure to accommodate a wider range of outputs.\n\nThe tree structure's adaptability is further enhanced by the memory module, which serves as a repository for the conversation history and other relevant data, providing the necessary context for the Prompter agent to generate useful hints [REF9]. This module can be seen as the roots of the tree, grounding the reasoning process in a rich substrate of information.\n\nFinally, the quality of the tree-structured XoT reasoning is contingent upon the model's ability to understand and respond to the prompts effectively. Improvements in prompt design or model fine-tuning are expected to yield better answer quality, as evidenced by the improved performance of SoT across various question categories [REF8].\n\nIn summary, the tree structure of XoT reasoning is characterized by its branching decision paths, backtracking capabilities, and adaptability to different problem types. The interplay between the ToT Controller, Prompter agent, and memory module underpins the system's ability to navigate complex reasoning tasks, with the potential for further enhancements to answer quality and coherence through improved model understanding and prompt design [REF0]-[REF9].", "references_sent_to_gpt": [{"title": "Large language model guided tree-of-thought", "bibref": "BIBREF80", "authors": [{"first": "Jieyi", "middle": [], "last": "Long", "suffix": ""}], "chunk": "Large language model guided tree-of-thought [SEP] 5\n\fAlgorithm 1 Policy Gradient based Training Algorithm for the ToT System\n1: Input: training set Ptrain, num of training epochs N\n2: procedure REINFORCE(Ptrain, N)\n3:\nrandomly initialized the ToT Controller policy \u03c0t\n\u03c1\n4:\nrandomly initialized the Prompter agent policy \u03c0p\n\u03b8\n5:\nfor epoch = 1, 2, .., N do\n6:\n\u03c0w \u2190 \u03c0t\n\u03c1 if epoch is even, \u03c0p\n\u03b8 otherwise \u25b7 update the selected policy only, fix the other\n7:\nfor pi \u2208 Ptrain do\n8:\nri \u2190 reward(ToTSystem(pi)) \u25b7 attempt to solve problem pi and obtain reward ri\n9:\nw \u2190 w + \u03b1\u2207wlog\u03c0wri\n10:\nend for\n11:\nend for\n12: end procedure\nSimilar to the ToT controller, we can also implement the prompter agent as a policy network, which\ncan generate prompts based on the current partial solution and the conversation history.

As opposed to previous-generation methods, which relied heavily on lexical resources,\nneural models only make use of pre-trained word\nembeddings. The few efforts to incorporate external lexical knowledge resulted in negligible performance gain (Chen et al., 2018).\nThis raises\nthe question whether (1) neural methods are inherently stronger, obviating the need of external lexical knowledge; (2) large-scale training data allows\nfor implicit learning of previously explicit lexical\nknowledge; or (3) the NLI datasets are simpler\nthan early RTE datasets, requiring less knowledge.\n1The contradiction example follows the assumption in\nBowman et al. (2015) that the premise contains the most\nprominent information in the event, hence the premise can\u2019t\ndescribe the event of a man holding both instruments.\nPremise/Hypothesis\nLabel\nThe man is holding a saxophone\ncontradiction1\nThe man is holding an electric guitar\nA little girl is very sad.\nentailment\nA little girl is very unhappy.\nA couple drinking wine\nneutral\nA couple drinking champagne\nTable 1: Examples from the new test set.\nIn this paper we show that state-of-the-art NLI\nsystems are limited in their generalization ability,\nand fail to capture many simple inferences that require lexical and world knowledge. Inspired by\nthe work of Jia and Liang (2017) on reading comprehension, we create a new NLI test set with examples that capture various kinds of lexical knowledge (Table 1). For example, that champagne is\na type of wine (hypernymy), and that saxophone\nand electric guitar are different musical instruments (co-hyponyms). To isolate lexical knowledge aspects, our constructed examples contain\nonly words that appear both in the training set and\nin pre-trained embeddings, and differ by a single\nword from sentences in the training set.\nThe performance on the new test set is substantially worse across systems, demonstrating that the\nSNLI test set alone is not a sufficient measure of\nlanguage understanding capabilities. Our results\nare in line with Gururangan et al. (2018) and Poliak et al. (2018), who showed that the label can\nbe identified by looking only at the hypothesis and\nexploiting annotation artifacts such as word choice\nand sentence length.\nFurther investigation shows that what mostly\naffects the systems\u2019 ability to correctly predict\na test example is the amount of similar examples found in the training set. Given that training data will always be limited, this is a rather\ninefficient way to learn lexical inferences, stressing the need to develop methods that do this more\n\feffectively.\nOur test set can be used to evaluate such models\u2019 ability to recognize lexical inferences, and it is available at https://github.com/\nBIU-NLP/Breaking NLI.\n2\nBackground\nNLI Datasets.\nThe SNLI dataset (Stanford Natural Language Inference, Bowman et al., 2015)\nconsists of 570k sentence-pairs manually labeled\nas entailment, contradiction, and neutral. Premises\nare image captions from Young et al. (2014), while\nhypotheses were generated by crowd-sourced\nworkers who were shown a premise and asked to\ngenerate entailing, contradicting, and neutral sentences. Workers were instructed to judge the relation between sentences given that they describe\nthe same event. Hence, sentences that differ by a\nsingle mutually-exclusive term should be considered contradicting, as in \u201cThe president visited Alabama\u201d and \u201cThe president visited Mississippi\u201d.\nThis differs from traditional RTE datasets, which\ndo not assume event coreference, and in which\nsuch sentence-pairs would be considered neutral.\nFollowing criticism on the simplicity of the\ndataset, stemming mostly from its narrow domain,\ntwo additional datasets have been collected. The\nMultiNLI dataset (Multi-Genre Natural Language\nInference, Williams et al., 2018) was collected\nsimilarly to SNLI, though covering a wider range\nof genres, and supporting a cross-genre evaluation.\nThe SciTail dataset (Khot et al., 2018), created\nfrom science exams, is somewhat different from\nthe two datasets, being smaller (27,026 examples),\nand labeled only as entailment or neutral. The domain makes this dataset different in nature from\nthe other two datasets, and it consists of more factual sentences rather than scene descriptions.\nNeural Approaches for NLI.\nFollowing the release of SNLI, there has been tremendous interest in the task, and many end-to-end neural models were developed, achieving promising results.2\nMethods are divided into two main approaches.\nSentence-encoding models (e.g. Bowman et al.,\n2015, 2016; Nie and Bansal, 2017; Shen et al.,\n2018) encode the premise and hypothesis individually, while attention-based models align words\nin the premise with similar words in the hypothesis, encoding the two sentences together (e.g.\nRockt\u00a8aschel et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2017).\n2See the SNLI leaderboard for a comprehensive list:\nhttps://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/.\nExternal Lexical Knowledge.\nTraditional RTE\nmethods typically relied on resources such as\nWordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) to identify lexical inferences. Conversely, neural methods rely solely\non pre-trained word embeddings, yet, they achieve\nhigh accuracy on SNLI.\nThe only neural model to date that incorporates external lexical knowledge (from WordNet)\nis KIM (Chen et al., 2018), however, gaining only\na small addition of 0.6 points in accuracy on the\nSNLI test set. This raises the question whether the\nsmall performance gap is a result of the model not\ncapturing lexical knowledge well, or the SNLI test\nset not requiring this knowledge in the first place.\n3\nData Collection\nWe construct a test set with the goal of evaluating\nthe ability of state-of-the-art NLI models to make\ninferences that require simple lexical knowledge.\nWe automatically generate sentence pairs (\u00a73.1)\nwhich are then manually verified (\u00a73.2).\n3.1\nGenerating Adversarial Examples\nIn order to isolate the lexical knowledge aspects,\nthe premises are taken from the SNLI training set.\nFor each premise we generate several hypotheses\nby replacing a single word within the premise by\na different word. We also allow some multi-word\nnoun phrases (\u201celectric guitar\u201d) and adapt determiners and prepositions when needed.\nWe focus on generating only entailment and\ncontradiction examples, while neutral examples\nmay be generated as a by-product.\nEntailment\nexamples are generated by replacing a word with\nits synonym or hypernym, while contradiction examples are created by replacing words with mutually exclusive co-hyponyms and antonyms (see\nTable 1). The generation steps are detailed below.\nReplacement Words.\nWe collected the replacement words using online resources for English\nlearning.3\nThe newly introduced words are all\npresent in the SNLI training set:\nfrom occurrence in a single training example (\u201cPortugal\u201d)\nup to 248,051 examples (\u201cman\u201d), with a mean of\n3,663.1 and a median of 149.5.\nThe words are\nalso available in the pre-trained embeddings vocabulary. The goal of this constraint is to isolate\nlexical knowledge aspects, and evaluate the models\u2019 ability to generalize and make new inferences\nfor known words.\n3www.enchantedlearning.com, www.smart-words.org\n\fSNLI Test\nNew Test\nInstances:\ncontradiction\n3,236\n7,164\nentailment\n3,364\n982\nneutral\n3,215\n47\nOverall\n9,815\n8,193\nFleiss \u03ba:\ncontradiction\n0.77\n0.61\nentailment\n0.69\n0.90\nOverall\n0.67\n0.61\nEstimated human performance:\n87.7%\n94.1%\nTable 2: Statistics of the test sets. 9,815 is the\nnumber of samples with majority agreement in the\nSNLI test set, whose full size is 9,824.\nReplacement words are divided into topical categories detailed in Table 4. In several categories\nwe applied additional processing to ensure that examples are indeed mutually-exclusive, topicallysimilar, and interchangeable in context.\nWe included WordNet antonyms with the same part-ofspeech and with a cosine similarity score above a\nthreshold, using GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014).\nIn nationalities and countries we focused on countries which are related geographically (Japan,\nChina) or culturally (Argentina, Spain).\nSentence-Pairs.\nTo avoid introducing new information not present in the training data, we sampled premises from the SNLI training set that contain words from our lists, and generated hypotheses by replacing the selected word with its replacement. Some of the generated sentences may be ungrammatical or nonsensical, for instance, when replacing Jordan with Syria in sentences discussing\nMichael Jordan. We used Wikipedia bigrams4 to\ndiscard sentences in which the replaced word created a bigram with less than 10 occurrences.\n3.2\nManual Verification\nWe manually verify the correctness of the automatically constructed examples using crowdsourced workers in Amazon Mechanical Turk. To\nensure the quality of workers, we applied a qualification test and required a 99% approval rate for\nat least 1,000 prior tasks. We assigned each annotation to 3 workers.\nFollowing the SNLI guidelines, we instructed\nthe workers to consider the sentences as describing\nthe same event, but we simplified the annotation\nprocess into answering 3 simple yes/no questions:\n1. Do the sentences describe the same event?\n4github.com/rmaestre/Wikipedia-Bigram-Open-Datasets\n2. Does the new sentence (hypothesis) add new\ninformation to the original sentence (premise)?\n3. Is the new sentence incorrect/ungrammatical?\nWe then discarded any sentence-pair in which\nat least one worker answered the third question\npositively. If the answer to the first question was\nnegative, we considered the label as contradiction.\nOtherwise, we considered the label as entailment\nif the answer to the second question was negative\nand neutral if it was positive. We used the majority vote to determine the gold label.\nThe annotations yielded substantial agreement,\nwith Fleiss\u2019 Kappa \u03ba = 0.61 (Landis and Koch,\n1977). We estimate human performance to 94.1%,\nusing the method described in Gong et al. (2018),\nshowing that the new test set is substantially easier\nto humans than SNLI. Table 2 provides additional\nstatistics on the test set.5\n4\nEvaluation\n4.1\nModels\nWithout External Knowledge.\nWe chose 3 representative models in different approaches (sentence encoding and/or attention):\nRESIDUALSTACKED-ENCODER (Nie and Bansal, 2017) is\na biLSTM-based single sentence-encoding model\nwithout attention. As opposed to traditional multilayer biLSTMs, the input to each next layer is\nthe concatenation of the word embedding and\nthe summation of outputs from previous layers. ESIM (Enhanced Sequential Inference Model,\nChen et al., 2017) is a hybrid TreeLSTM-based\nand biLSTM-based model.\nWe use the biLSTM model, which uses an inter-sentence attention mechanism to align words across sentences.\nFinally, DECOMPOSABLE ATTENTION (Parikh\net al., 2016) performs soft alignment of words\nfrom the premise to words in the hypothesis using attention mechanism, and decomposes the task\ninto comparison of aligned words. Lexical-level\ndecisions are merged to produce the final classification. We use the AllenNLP re-implementation,6\nwhich does not implement the optional intrasentence attention, and achieves an accuracy of\n84.7% on the SNLI test set, comparable to 86.3%\nby the original system.\n5We note that due to its bias towards contradiction, the\nnew test set can neither be used for training, nor serve as a\nmain evaluation set for NLI. Instead, we suggest to use it in\naddition to the original test set in order to test a model\u2019s ability to handle lexical inferences.\n6http://allennlp.org/models\n\fModel\nTrain set\nSNLI test set\nNew test set\n\u2206\nDecomposable Attention\n(Parikh et al., 2016)\nSNLI\n84.7%\n51.9%\n-32.8\nMultiNLI + SNLI\n84.9%\n65.8%\n-19.1\nSciTail + SNLI\n85.0%\n49.0%\n-36.0\nESIM (Chen et al., 2017)\nSNLI\n87.9%\n65.6%\n-22.3\nMultiNLI + SNLI\n86.3%\n74.9%\n-11.4\nSciTail + SNLI\n88.3%\n67.7%\n-20.6\nResidual-Stacked-Encoder\n(Nie and Bansal, 2017)\nSNLI\n86.0%\n62.2%\n-23.8\nMultiNLI + SNLI\n84.6%\n68.2%\n-16.8\nSciTail + SNLI\n85.0%\n60.1%\n-24.9\nWordNet Baseline\n-85.8%\n-KIM (Chen et al., 2018)\nSNLI\n88.6%\n83.5%\n-5.1\nTable 3: Accuracy of various models trained on SNLI or a union of SNLI with another dataset (MultiNLI,\nSciTail), and tested on the original SNLI test set and the new test set.\nWe chose models which are amongst the best\nperforming within their approaches (excluding ensembles) and have available code.\nAll models\nare based on pre-trained GloVe embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014), which are either fine-tuned\nduring training (RESIDUAL-STACKED-ENCODER\nand ESIM) or stay fixed (DECOMPOSABLE AT-\nTENTION). All models predict the label using a\nconcatenation of features derived from the sentence representations (e.g. maximum, mean), for\nexample as in Mou et al. (2016). We use the recommended hyper-parameters for each model, as\nthey appear in the provided code.\nWith External Knowledge.\nWe provide a simple WORDNET BASELINE, in which we classify\na sentence-pair according to the WordNet relation\nthat holds between the original word wp and the\nreplaced word wh. We predict entailment if wp is\na hyponym of wh or if they are synonyms, neutral\nif wp is a hypernym of wh, and contradiction if wp\nand wh are antonyms or if they share a common\nhypernym ancestor (up to 2 edges). Word pairs\nwith no WordNet relations are classified as other.\nWe\nalso\nreport\nthe\nperformance\nof\nKIM\n(Knowledge-based Inference Model, Chen et al.,\n2018), an extension of ESIM with external knowledge from WordNet, which was kindly provided\nto us by Qian Chen. KIM improves the attention\nmechanism by taking into account the existence\nof WordNet relations between the words. The lexical inference component, operating over pairs of\naligned words, is enriched with a vector encoding\nthe specific WordNet relations between the words.\n4.2\nExperimental Settings\nWe trained each model on 3 different datasets: (1)\nSNLI train set, (2) a union of the SNLI train set\nand the MultiNLI train set, and (3) a union of the\nSNLI train set and the SciTail train set. The motivation is that while SNLI might lack the training\ndata needed to learn the required lexical knowledge, it may be available in the other datasets,\nwhich are presumably richer.\n4.3\nResults\nTable 3 displays the results for all the models on\nthe original SNLI test set and the new test set. Despite the task being considerably simpler, the drop\nin performance is substantial, ranging from 11 to\n33 points in accuracy. Adding MultiNLI to the\ntraining data somewhat mitigates this drop in accuracy, thanks to almost doubling the amount of\ntraining data. We note that adding SciTail to the\ntraining data did not similarly improve the performance; we conjecture that this stems from the differences between the datasets.\nKIM substantially outperforms the other neural\nmodels, demonstrating that lexical knowledge is\nthe only requirement for good performance on the\nnew test set, and stressing the inability of the other\nmodels to learn it. Both WordNet-informed models leave room for improvement: possibly due to\nlimited WordNet coverage and the implications of\napplying lexical inferences within context.\n5\nAnalysis\nWe take a deeper look into the predictions of the\nmodels that don\u2019t employ external knowledge, focusing on the models trained on SNLI.\n5.1\nAccuracy by Category\nTable 4 displays the accuracy of each model per\nreplacement-word category.\nThe neural models\ntend to perform well on categories which are frequent in the training set, such as colors, and badly\n\fDominant\nLabel\nCategory\nInstances\nExample\nWords\nDecomposable\nAttention\nESIM\nResidual\nEncoders\nWordNet\nBaseline\nKIM\nCont.\nantonyms\n1,147\nloves - dislikes\n41.6%\n70.4%\n58.2%\n95.5%\n86.5%\ncardinals\n759\nfive - seven\n53.5%\n75.5%\n53.1%\n98.6%\n93.4%\nnationalities\n755\nGreek - Italian\n37.5%\n35.9%\n70.9%\n78.5%\n73.5%\ndrinks\n731\nlemonade - beer\n52.9%\n63.7%\n52.0%\n94.8%\n96.6%\nantonyms (WN)\n706\nsitting - standing\n55.1%\n74.6%\n67.9%\n94.5%\n78.8%\ncolors\n699\nred - blue\n85.0%\n96.1%\n87.0%\n98.7%\n98.3%\nordinals\n663\nfifth - 16th\n2.1%\n21.0%\n5.4%\n40.7%\n56.6%\ncountries\n613\nMexico - Peru\n15.2%\n25.4%\n66.2%\n100.0%\n70.8%\nrooms\n595\nkitchen - bathroom\n59.2%\n69.4%\n63.4%\n89.9%\n77.6%\nmaterials\n397\nstone - glass\n65.2%\n89.7%\n79.9%\n75.3%\n98.7%\nvegetables\n109\ntomato -potato\n43.1%\n31.2%\n37.6%\n86.2%\n79.8%\ninstruments\n65\nharmonica - harp\n96.9%\n90.8%\n96.9%\n67.7%\n96.9%\nplanets\n60\nMars - Venus\n31.7%\n3.3%\n21.7%\n100.0%\n5.0%\nEnt.\nsynonyms\n894\nhappy - joyful\n97.5%\n99.7%\n86.1%\n70.5%\n92.1%\ntotal\n8,193\n51.9%\n65.6%\n62.2%\n85.8%\n83.5%\nTable 4: The number of instances and accuracy per category achieved by each model.\non categories such as planets, which rarely occur\nin SNLI. These models perform better than the\nWordNet baseline on entailment examples (synonyms), suggesting that they do so due to high\nlexical overlap between the premise and the hypothesis rather than recognizing synonymy. We\ntherefore focus the rest of the discussion on contradiction examples.\n5.2\nAccuracy by Word Similarity\nThe accuracies for ordinals, nationalities and\ncountries are especially low. We conjecture that\nthis stems from the proximity of the contradicting words in the embedding space. Indeed, the\nDecomposable Attention model\u2014which does not\nupdate its embeddings during training\u2014seems to\nsuffer the most.\nGrouping its prediction accuracy by the cosine\nsimilarity between the contradicting words reveals\na clear trend that the model errs more on contradicting pairs with similar pre-trained vectors:7\nSimilarity\n0.5-0.6\n0.6-0.7\n0.7-0.8\n0.8-0.9\n0.9-1.0\nAccuracy\n46.2%\n42.3%\n37.5%\n29.7%\n20.2%\n5.3\nAccuracy by Frequency in Training\nModels that fine-tune the word embeddings may\nbenefit from training examples consisting of test\nreplacement pairs. Namely, for a given replacement pair (wp, wh), if many training examples labeled as contradiction contain wp in the premise\nand wh in the hypothesis, the model may update\ntheir embeddings to optimize predicting contradiction. Indeed, we show that the ESIM accuracy on\ntest pairs increases with the frequency in which\n7We ignore multi-word replacements in \u00a75.2 and \u00a75.3.\ntheir replacement words appear in contradiction\nexamples in the training data:\nFrequency\n0\n1-4\n5-9\n10-49\n50-99\n100+\nAccuracy\n40.2% 70.6% 91.4% 92.1% 97.5% 98.5%\nThis demonstrates that the model is capable of\nlearning lexical knowledge when sufficient training data is given, but relying on explicit training\nexamples is a very inefficient way of obtaining\nsimple lexical knowledge.\n6\nConclusion\nWe created a new NLI test set with the goal of\nevaluating systems\u2019 ability to make inferences that\nrequire simple lexical knowledge. Although the\ntest set is constructed to be much simpler than\nSNLI, and does not introduce new vocabulary, the\nstate-of-the-art systems perform poorly on it, suggesting that they are limited in their generalization\nability. The test set can be used in the future to assess the lexical inference abilities of NLI systems\nand to tease apart the performance of otherwise\nvery similarly-performing systems.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Qian Chen for evaluating KIM on our test set.\nThis work was supported in part by the German Research Foundation through the German-Israeli Project Cooperation (DIP, grant DA 1600/1-1), an Intel ICRI-CI\ngrant, Theo Hoffenberg, and the Israel Science\nFoundation grants 1951/17 and 1555/15.

The new examples are simpler than the SNLI test set, containing sentences that differ by at most one word from sentences in the training set. Yet, the performance on the new test set is substantially worse across systems trained on SNLI, demonstrating that these systems are limited in their generalization ability, failing to capture many simple inferences.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nRecognizing textual entailment (RTE) [1], recently framed as natural language inference (NLI) [1] is a task concerned with identifying whether a _premise_ sentence entails, contradicts or is neutral with the _hypothesis_ sentence. Following the release of the large-scale SNLI dataset [1], many end-to-end neural models have been developed for the task, achieving high accuracy on the test set. As opposed to previous-generation methods, which relied heavily on lexical resources, neural models only make use of pre-trained word embeddings. The few efforts to incorporate external lexical knowledge resulted in negligible performance gain [1]. This raises the question whether (1) neural methods are inherently stronger, obviating the need of external lexical knowledge; (2) large-scale training data allows for implicit learning of previously explicit lexical knowledge; or (3) the NLI datasets are simpler than early RTE datasets, requiring less knowledge.\n\nIn this paper we show that state-of-the-art NLI systems are limited in their generalization ability, and fail to capture many simple inferences that require lexical and world knowledge. Inspired by the work of Jia and Liang (2017) on reading comprehension, we create a new NLI test set with examples that capture various kinds of lexical knowledge (Table 1). For example, that _champagne_ is a type of _wine_ (hypernymy), and that _saxophone_ and _electric guitar_ are different musical instruments (co-hyponyms). To isolate lexical knowledge aspects, our constructed examples contain only words that appear both in the training set and in pre-trained embeddings, and differ by a single word from sentences in the training set.\n\nThe performance on the new test set is substantially worse across systems, demonstrating that the SNLI test set alone is not a sufficient measure of language understanding capabilities. Our results are in line with gururangan2018neural and poliak2018neural, who showed that the label can be identified by looking only at the hypothesis and exploiting annotation artifacts such as word choice and sentence length.\n\nFurther investigation shows that what mostly affects the systems' ability to correctly predict a test example is the amount of similar examples found in the training set. Given that training data will always be limited, this is a rather inefficient way to learn lexical inferences, stressing the need to develop methods that do this more\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c} \\hline \\hline\n**Premise/Hypothesis** & **Label** \\\\ \\hline The man is holding a saxophone & \\\\ The man is holding an electric guitar & contradiction1 \\\\ \\hline A little girl is very sad. & \\\\ A little girl is very unhappy. & entailment \\\\ \\hline A couple drinking wine & \\\\ A couple drinking champagne & neutral \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: Examples from the new test set.\n\neffectively. Our test set can be used to evaluate such models' ability to recognize lexical inferences, and it is available at [https://github.com/BIU-NLP/Breaking_NLI](https://github.com/BIU-NLP/Breaking_NLI).\n\n## 2 Background\n\nNLI Datasets.The SNLI dataset (Stanford Natural Language Inference, Bowman et al., 2015) consists of 570k sentence-pairs manually labeled as entailment, contradiction, and neutral. Premises are image captions from Young et al. (2014), while hypotheses were generated by crowd-sourced workers who were shown a premise and asked to generate entailing, contradicting, and neutral sentences. Workers were instructed to judge the relation between sentences _given that they describe the same event_. Hence, sentences that differ by a single mutually-exclusive term should be considered contradicting, as in \"The president visited Alabama\" and \"The president visited Mississippi\". This differs from traditional RTE datasets, which do not assume event coreference, and in which such sentence-pairs would be considered neutral.\n\nFollowing criticism on the simplicity of the dataset, stemming mostly from its narrow domain, two additional datasets have been collected. The MultiNLI dataset (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference, Williams et al., 2018) was collected similarly to SNLI, though covering a wider range of genres, and supporting a cross-genre evaluation. The SciTail dataset (Khot et al., 2018), created from science exams, is somewhat different from the two datasets, being smaller (27,026 examples), and labeled only as entailment or neutral. The domain makes this dataset different in nature from the other two datasets, and it consists of more factual sentences rather than scene descriptions.\n\nNeural Approaches for NLI.Following the release of SNLI, there has been tremendous interest in the task, and many end-to-end neural models were developed, achieving promising results.2 Methods are divided into two main approaches. Sentence-encoding models (e.g. Bowman et al., 2015, 2016; Nie and Bansal, 2017; Shen et al., 2018) encode the premise and hypothesis individually, while attention-based models align words in the premise with similar words in the hypothesis, encoding the two sentences together (e.g. Rocktaschel et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2017).\n\nFootnote 2: See the SNLI leaderboard for a comprehensive list: [https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/).\n\nExternal Lexical Knowledge.Traditional RTE methods typically relied on resources such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) to identify lexical inferences. Conversely, neural methods rely solely on pre-trained word embeddings, yet, they achieve high accuracy on SNLI.\n\nThe only neural model to date that incorporates external lexical knowledge (from WordNet) is KIM (Chen et al., 2018), however, gaining only a small addition of 0.6 points in accuracy on the SNLI test set. This raises the question whether the small performance gap is a result of the model not capturing lexical knowledge well, or the SNLI test set not requiring this knowledge in the first place.\n\n## 3 Data Collection\n\nWe construct a test set with the goal of evaluating the ability of state-of-the-art NLI models to make inferences that require simple lexical knowledge. We automatically generate sentence pairs (SS3.1) which are then manually verified (SS3.2).\n\n### Generating Adversarial Examples\n\nIn order to isolate the lexical knowledge aspects, the premises are taken from the SNLI training set. For each premise we generate several hypotheses by replacing a single word within the premise by a different word. We also allow some multi-word noun phrases (\"electric guitar\") and adapt determiners and prepositions when needed.\n\nWe focus on generating only _entailment_ and _contradiction_ examples, while _neutral_ examples may be generated as a by-product. _Entailment_ examples are generated by replacing a word with its synonym or hypernym, while _contradiction_ examples are created by replacing words with mutually exclusive co-hyponyms and antonyms (see Table 1). The generation steps are detailed below.\n\nReplacement Words.We collected the replacement words using online resources for English learning.3 The newly introduced words are all present in the SNLI training set: from occurrence in a single training example (\"Portugal\") up to 248,051 examples (\"man\"), with a mean of 3,663.1 and a median of 149.5. The words are also available in the pre-trained embeddings vocabulary. The goal of this constraint is to isolate lexical knowledge aspects, and evaluate the models' ability to generalize and make new inferences for known words.\n\nFootnote 3: www.enchantedlearning.com,www.smart-words.orgReplacement words are divided into topical categories detailed in Table 4. In several categories we applied additional processing to ensure that examples are indeed mutually-exclusive, topically-similar, and interchangeable in context. We included WordNet antonyms with the same part-of-speech and with a cosine similarity score above a threshold, using GloVe [17]. In _nationalities_ and _countries_ we focused on countries which are related geographically _(Japan, China)_ or culturally _(Argentina, Spain)_.\n\nSentence-Pairs.To avoid introducing new information not present in the training data, we sampled premises from the SNLI training set that contain words from our lists, and generated hypotheses by replacing the selected word with its replacement. Some of the generated sentences may be ungrammatical or nonsensical, for instance, when replacing _Jordan_ with _Syria_ in sentences discussing _Michael Jordan_. We used Wikipedia bigrams4 to discard sentences in which the replaced word created a bigram with less than 10 occurrences.\n\nFootnote 4: github.com/rmasetre/Wikipedia-Bigram-Open-Datasets\n\n### Manual Verification\n\nWe manually verify the correctness of the automatically constructed examples using crowd-sourced workers in Amazon Mechanical Turk. To ensure the quality of workers, we applied a qualification test and required a 99% approval rate for at least 1,000 prior tasks. We assigned each annotation to 3 workers.\n\nFollowing the SNLI guidelines, we instructed the workers to consider the sentences as describing the same event, but we simplified the annotation process into answering 3 simple yes/no questions:\n\n1. Do the sentences describe the same event?\n2. Does the new sentence (hypothesis) add new information to the original sentence (premise)?\n3. Is the new sentence incorrect/ungrammatical?\n\nWe then discarded any sentence-pair in which at least one worker answered the third question positively. If the answer to the first question was negative, we considered the label as _contradiction_. Otherwise, we considered the label as _entailment_ if the answer to the second question was negative and _neutral_ if it was positive. We used the majority vote to determine the gold label.\n\nThe annotations yielded substantial agreement, with Fleiss' Kappa \\(\\kappa=0.61\\)[10]. We estimate human performance to 94.1%, using the method described in Gong2018, showing that the new test set is substantially easier to humans than SNLI. Table 2 provides additional statistics on the test set.5\n\nFootnote 5: We note that due to its bias towards _contradiction_, the new test set can neither be used for training, nor serve as a main evaluation set for NLI. Instead, we suggest to use it in addition to the original test set in order to test a model\u2019s ability to handle lexical inferences.\n\n## 4 Evaluation\n\n### Models\n\nWithout External Knowledge.We chose 3 representative models in different approaches (sentence encoding and/or attention): Residual-Stacked-Encoder [20] is a biLSTM-based single sentence-encoding model without attention. As opposed to traditional multi-layer biLSTMs, the input to each next layer is the concatenation of the word embedding and the summation of outputs from previous layers. Esim (Enhanced Sequential Inference Model, Chen2017) is a hybrid TreeLSTM-based and biLSTM-based model. We use the biLSTM model, which uses an inter-sentence attention mechanism to align words across sentences. Finally, Decomposable Attention[11] performs soft alignment of words from the premise to words in the hypothesis using attention mechanism, and decomposes the task into comparison of aligned words. Lexical-level decisions are merged to produce the final classification. We use the AllenNLP re-implementation,6 which does not implement the optional intra-sentence attention, and achieves an accuracy of 84.7% on the SNLI test set, comparable to 86.3% by the original system.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l r r} \\hline \\hline  & **SNLI Test** & **New Test** \\\\ \\hline\n**Instances:** & & \\\\ _contradiction_ & 3,236 & 7,164 \\\\ _entailment_ & 3,364 & 982 \\\\ _neutral_ & 3,215 & 47 \\\\ Overall & 9,815 & 8,193 \\\\ \\hline\n**Fleiss \\(\\kappa\\):** & & \\\\ _contradiction_ & 0.77 & 0.61 \\\\ _entailment_ & 0.69 & 0.90 \\\\ Overall & 0.67 & 0.61 \\\\ \\hline\n**Estimated human performance:** & & \\\\  & 87.7\\% & 94.1\\% \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 2: Statistics of the test sets. 9,815 is the number of samples with majority agreement in the SNLI test set, whose full size is 9,824.\n\nWe chose models which are amongst the best performing within their approaches (excluding ensembles) and have available code. All models are based on pre-trained GloVe embeddings Pennington et al. (2014), which are either fine-tuned during training (Residual-Stacked-Encoder and esim) or stay fixed (Decomposable Attention). All models predict the label using a concatenation of features derived from the sentence representations (e.g. maximum, mean), for example as in Mou et al. (2016). We use the recommended hyper-parameters for each model, as they appear in the provided code.\n\nWith External Knowledge.We provide a simple WordNet baseline, in which we classify a sentence-pair according to the WordNet relation that holds between the original word \\(w_{p}\\) and the replaced word \\(w_{h}\\). We predict _entailment_ if \\(w_{p}\\) is a hyponym of \\(w_{h}\\) or if they are synonyms, _neutral_ if \\(w_{p}\\) is a hypernym of \\(w_{h}\\), and _contradiction_ if \\(w_{p}\\) and \\(w_{h}\\) are antonyms or if they share a common hypernym ancestor (up to 2 edges). Word pairs with no WordNet relations are classified as _other_.\n\nWe also report the performance of kim (Knowledge-based Inference Model, Chen et al., 2018), an extension of esim with external knowledge from WordNet, which was kindly provided to us by Qian Chen. Kim improves the attention mechanism by taking into account the existence of WordNet relations between the words. The lexical inference component, operating over pairs of aligned words, is enriched with a vector encoding the specific WordNet relations between the words.\n\n### Experimental Settings\n\nWe trained each model on 3 different datasets: (1) SNLI train set, (2) a union of the SNLI train set and the MultiNLI train set, and (3) a union of the SNLI train set and the SciTail train set. The motivation is that while SNLI might lack the training data needed to learn the required lexical knowledge, it may be available in the other datasets, which are presumably richer.\n\n### Results\n\nTable 3 displays the results for all the models on the original SNLI test set and the new test set. Despite the task being considerably simpler, the drop in performance is substantial, ranging from 11 to 33 points in accuracy. Adding MultiNLI to the training data somewhat mitigates this drop in accuracy, thanks to almost doubling the amount of training data. We note that adding SciTail to the training data did not similarly improve the performance; we conjecture that this stems from the differences between the datasets.\n\nKim substantially outperforms the other neural models, demonstrating that lexical knowledge is the only requirement for good performance on the new test set, and stressing the inability of the other models to learn it. Both WordNet-informed models leave room for improvement: possibly due to limited WordNet coverage and the implications of applying lexical inferences within context.\n\n## 5 Analysis\n\nWe take a deeper look into the predictions of the models that don't employ external knowledge, focusing on the models trained on SNLI.\n\n### Accuracy by Category\n\nTable 4 displays the accuracy of each model per replacement-word category. The neural models tend to perform well on categories which are frequent in the training set, such as _colors_, and badly\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} \\hline \\hline\n**Model** & **Train set** & **SNLI test set** & **New test set** & \\(\\Delta\\) \\\\ \\hline \\multirow{3}{*}{\\begin{tabular}{} \\end{tabular} } & SNLI & 84.7\\% & 51.9\\% & -32.8 \\\\  & MultiNLI + SNLI & 84.9\\% & 65.8\\% & -19.1 \\\\  & SciTail + SNLI & 85.0\\% & 49.0\\% & -36.0 \\\\ \\hline \\multirow{3}{*}{ESIM Chen et al.

These models perform better than the WordNet baseline on entailment examples (_synonyms_), suggesting that they do so due to high lexical overlap between the premise and the hypothesis rather than recognizing synonymy. We therefore focus the rest of the discussion on contradiction examples.\n\n### Accuracy by Word Similarity\n\nThe accuracies for _ordinals_, _nationalities_ and _countries_ are especially low. We conjecture that this stems from the proximity of the contradicting words in the embedding space. Indeed, the Decomposable Attention model--which does not update its embeddings during training--seems to suffer the most.\n\nGrouping its prediction accuracy by the cosine similarity between the contradicting words reveals a clear trend that the model errs more on contradicting pairs with similar pre-trained vectors:7\n\nFootnote 7: We ignore multi-word replacements in \u00a75.2 and \u00a75.3.\n\n### Accuracy by Frequency in Training\n\nModels that fine-tune the word embeddings may benefit from training examples consisting of test replacement pairs. Namely, for a given replacement pair (\\(w_{p}\\), \\(w_{h}\\)), if many training examples labeled as contradiction contain \\(w_{p}\\) in the premise and \\(w_{h}\\) in the hypothesis, the model may update their embeddings to optimize predicting contradiction. Indeed, we show that the ESIM accuracy on test pairs increases with the frequency in which their replacement words appear in contradiction examples in the training data:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \\hline \\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{**Dominant Label**} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{**Category**} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{**Instances**} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{**Example Words**} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{**Decomposable Attention**} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{**ESIM**} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{**Residual Encoders**} & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{**WordNet Baseline**} & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{**KIM**} \\\\ \\hline \\multirow{6}{*}{Cont.} & antonyms & 1,147 & _loves - dislikes_ & 41.6\\% & 70.4\\% & 58.2\\% & 95.5\\% & 86.5\\% \\\\  & cardinals & 759 & _five - seven_ & 53.5\\% & 75.5\\% & 53.1\\% & 98.6\\% & 93.4\\% \\\\  & nationalities & 755 & _Greek - Italian_ & 37.5\\% & 35.9\\% & 70.9\\% & 78.5\\% & 73.5\\% \\\\  & drinks & 731 & _lemonde - beer_ & 52.9\\% & 63.7\\% & 52.0\\% & 94.8\\% & 96.6\\% \\\\  & antonyms (WN) & 706 & _sitting - standing_ & 55.1\\% & 74.6\\% & 67.9\\% & 94.5\\% & 78.8\\% \\\\  & colors & 699 & _red - blue_ & 85.0\\% & 96.1\\% & 87.0\\% & 98.7\\% & 98.3\\% \\\\  & ordinals & 663 & _fifth - 16th_ & 2.1\\% & 21.0\\% & 5.4\\% & 40.7\\% & 56.6\\% \\\\  & countries & 613 & _Mexico - Peru_ & 15.2\\% & 25.4\\% & 66.2\\% & 100.0\\% & 70.8\\% \\\\  & rooms & 595 & _kitchen - bathroom_ & 59.2\\% & 69.4\\% & 63.4\\% & 89.9\\% & 77.6\\% \\\\  & materials & 397 & _stone - glass_ & 65.2\\% & 89.7\\% & 79.9\\% & 75.3\\% & 98.7\\% \\\\  & vegetables & 109 & _tomato - potato_ & 43.1\\% & 31.2\\% & 37.6\\% & 86.2\\% & 79.8\\% \\\\  & instruments & 65 & _harmonica - harp_ & 96.9\\% & 90.8\\% & 96.9\\% & 67.7\\% & 96.9\\% \\\\  & planets & 60 & _Mars - Venus_ & 31.7\\% & 3.3\\% & 21.7\\% & 100.0\\% & 5.0\\% \\\\ \\hline Ent. & synonyms & 894 & _happy - joyful_ & 97.5\\% & 99.7\\% & 86.1\\% & 70.5\\% & 92.1\\% \\\\ \\hline  & total & 8,193 & & 51.9\\% & 65.6\\% & 62.2\\% & 85.8\\% & 83.5\\% \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\nTable 4: The number of instances and accuracy per category achieved by each model.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \\hline \\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{**Frequency**} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{0} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{1-4} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{5-9} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{10-49} & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{50-99} & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{100+} \\\\ \\hline Accuracy & 40.2\\% & 70.6\\% & 91.4\\% & 92.1\\% & 97.5\\% & 98.5\\% \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\nThis demonstrates that the model is capable of learning lexical knowledge when sufficient training data is given, but relying on explicit training examples is a very inefficient way of obtaining simple lexical knowledge.\n\n## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe created a new NLI test set with the goal of evaluating systems' ability to make inferences that require simple lexical knowledge. Although the test set is constructed to be much simpler than SNLI, and does not introduce new vocabulary, the state-of-the-art systems perform poorly on it, suggesting that they are limited in their generalization ability. The test set can be used in the future to assess the lexical inference abilities of NLI systems and to tease apart the performance of otherwise very similarly-performing systems.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank Qian Chen for evaluating KIM on our test set.

Models trained or evaluated with only\nthis data may not perform well on real world tasks\nwhere such sensitivity is important.\nTo address this, we introduce a workflow (outlined in Figure 1) for generating pairs of sentences\nthat have high word overlap, but which are balanced with respect to whether they are paraphrases\nor not.\nUsing this process, we create PAWS\n(Paraphrase Adversaries from Word Scrambling),\na dataset constructed from sentences in Quora and\narXiv:1904.01130v1  [cs.CL]  1 Apr 2019\n\fSentence 1\nSentence 2\nGold\nBOW\nBERT\nBERT+\nPAWS\n(1) Can a bad person become good?\nCan a good person become bad?\nN\nY\nY\nN\n(2) Which is the cheapest flight from anywhere in South America to Europe?\nWhich is the cheapest flight from anywhere in Europe to South America?\nN\nY\nN\nN\n(3) \u201cTaunton Castle\u201d was on August 1 in Rio\nde Janeiro and on October 31 in Penang.\n\u201cTaunton Castle\u201d was at Penang on 1 August and Rio de Janeiro on 31 October.\nN\nY\nY\nN\n(4) Although\ninterchangeable,\nthe\nbody\npieces on the 2 cars are not similar.\nAlthough similar, the body parts are not\ninterchangeable on the 2 cars.\nN\nY\nY\nN\n(5) Katz was born in Sweden in 1947 and\nmoved to New York City at the age of 1.\nKatz was born in 1947 in Sweden and\nmoved to New York at the age of one.\nY\nY\nY\nY\n(6) It was not the sales manager who hit the\nbottle that day, but the office worker with\nthe serious drinking problem.\nThat day the office manager, who was\ndrinking, hit the problem sales worker\nwith a bottle, but it was not serious.\nN\nY\nY\nN\nTable 1: Paraphrase/Non-paraphrase (Y/N) pairs with high bag-of-words (BOW) overlap. (1)-(5) are drawn from\nPAWS, and (6) is from Mitchell and Lapata (2008). Both a simple BOW and the state-of-the-art BERT (Devlin\net al., 2018) models, if trained/fine-tuned on the Quora Question Pairs (QQP) corpus, classify all of them (with\none exception) as paraphrases (Y). A BERT model fine-tuned on both QQP and PAWS examples (BERT+PAWS),\nhowever, is able to get them correct.\nWikipedia.\nExamples are generated from controlled language models and back translation, and\ngiven five human ratings each in both phases. A\nfinal rule recombines annotated examples and balances the labels. Our final PAWS dataset will be\nreleased publicly with 108,463 pairs at https:\n//g.co/dataset/paws.\nWe show that existing state-of-the-art models\nfail miserably on PAWS when trained on existing resources, but some perform well when given\nPAWS training examples. BERT (Devlin et al.,\n2018) fine-tuned on QQP achieves over 90% accuracy on QQP, but only 33% accuracy on PAWS\ndata in the same domain.\nHowever, the accuracy on PAWS boosts to 85% by including 12k\nPAWS training pairs (without reducing QQP performance). Table 1 also shows that the new model\nis able to correctly classify challenging pairs. Annotation scale is also important:\nour learning\ncurves show strong models like BERT improve\nwith tens of thousands of training examples.\nOur experimental results also demonstrate that\nPAWS effectively measures sensitivity of models\nto word order and structure. Unlike BERT, a simple BOW model fails to learn from PAWS training\nexamples, demonstrating its weakness at capturing non-local contextual information. Our experiments show that the gains from PAWS examples\ncorrelate with the complexity of models.\n2\nRelated Work\nExisting data creation techniques have focused on\ncollecting paraphrases, e.g. from co-captions for\nimages (Lin et al., 2014), tweets with shared URLs\n(Lan et al., 2017), subtitles (Creutz, 2018), and\nback translation (Iyyer et al., 2018). Unlike all\nprevious work, we emphasize the collection of\nchallenging negative examples.\nOur work closely relates to the idea of crafting\nadversarial examples to break NLP systems. Existing approaches mostly focused on adding labelpreserving perturbations to inputs, but with the effect of distracting systems from correct answers.\nExample perturbation rules include adding noise\nto inputs (Jia and Liang, 2017; Chen et al., 2018),\nword replacements (Alzantot et al., 2018; Ribeiro\net al., 2018), and syntactic transformation (Iyyer\net al., 2018).\nA notable exception is Glockner\net al. (2018): they generated both entailment and\ncontradiction examples by replacing words with\ntheir synonyms or antonyms. Our work presents\ntwo main departures. We propose a novel method\nthat generates challenging examples with balanced\nclass labels and more word reordering variations\nthan previous work.\nIn addition, we release to\npublic a large set of 108k example pairs with highquality human labels. We believe the new dataset\nwill benefit future research on both adversarial example generation and improvement of model robustness.\nIn our work, we demonstrate the importance\nof capturing non-local contextual information in\nthe problem of paraphrase identification. This relates to prior work on probing sentence representations for their linguistic properties, such as how\nmuch syntactic information is encoded in representations (Conneau et al., 2018; Tenney et al.,\n\f{ Flights } { from, to } { New York, Florida }\nLSTM\nLSTM\nLSTM\nLSTM\nLSTM\nNNS\nIN\nLOCATION\n(a) Tagging\n(b) Candidates\n(c) Beam Search \nw/ Constraints\n[Flights]\nNNS\nIN\nLOCATION\nLOCATION\nIN\n[from]\n[Florida]\n[to]\n[New York]\n[Flights]\nNNS\nIN\nLOCATION\nLOCATION\nIN\n[from]\n[Florida]\n[to]\n[New York]\nNNS\nIN\nLOCATION\nFigure 2: Illustration of the generation method in three\nsteps.

(c) Under the constraints of tag sequence template and candidate sets, find sentences with high language model\nscores using beam search.\n2019; Ettinger et al., 2018). There also exists prior\nwork that directly uses structural information in\nmodeling (Filice et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2018).\nAll these prior approaches were evaluated on existing datasets. In contrast, we perform studies on\nPAWS, a new dataset that emphasizes the importance of capturing structural information in representation learning. While developing new models\nis beyond the scope of this paper, this new dataset\ncan facilitate research in this direction.\n3\nPAWS Example Generation\nWe define a PAWS pair to be a pair of sentences\nwith high bag-of-words (BOW) overlap but different word order. In the Quora Question Pairs corpus, 80% of such pairs are paraphrases. Here, we\ndescribe a method to automatically generate nontrivial and well-formed PAWS pairs from realworld text in any domain (this section), and then\nhave them annotated by human raters (Section 4).\nOur automatic generation method is based on\ntwo ideas. The first swaps words to generate a\nsentence pair with the same BOW, controlled by a\nlanguage model. The second uses back translation\nto generate paraphrases with high BOW overlap\nbut different word order. These two strategies generate high-quality, diverse PAWS pairs, balanced\nevenly between paraphrases and non-paraphrases.\n3.1\nWord Swapping\nOur first phase generates well-formed sentences\nby swapping words in real world text. Most text\ngeneration models rely on large amount of training\ndata (Iyyer et al., 2018; Guu et al., 2018; Gupta\net al., 2018; Li et al., 2018), which is unfortunately not available in our case. We thus propose a\nnovel generation method based on language modeling and constrained beam search. The goal is to\nfind a sentence that achieves high language model\nscore as well as satisfying all constraints. High\nscores indicate that generated sentences are natural and well-formed, and constraints ensure generated pairs have the same BOW.\nFigure 2 illustrates the generation procedure.\nFirst, given an input sentence, a CRF-based partof-speech tagger tags each word. We further detect\nperson names, locations, and organizations using\na named entity recognizer, and replace POS with\nentity tags if probability scores are above 95%.1\nThe sequence of tags of words and phrases form a\ntemplate for the input.\nOur beam search method then fills in each slot\nof the template from left to right, scoring each\nstate by a language model trained on one billion\nwords (Chelba et al., 2014). The candidate words\nand phrases for each slot are drawn from the input based on its tag. In Figure 2, for example,\nthe second slot must be filled with a LOCATION\nfrom two candidate New York and Florida. Candidates are drawn without replacement so the generated sentence and the input have exactly the same\nbag-of-words. Note that this template-based constraint is more restrictive than the BOW requirement, but we choose it because it significantly reduces the search space. With this constraint, the\nmethod achieves high generation quality without\na large beam. In practice, beam size is set to 100,\nwhich produces near-optimal results in most cases.\nLet s\u2032 be the best sentence in the beam other\nthan the input sentence s, and LM(\u00b7) be their\nlog-likelihood by the language model. We take\n(s, s\u2032) as a good word-swapping pair if LM(s\u2032) \u2265\nLM(s) \u2212 t.2\nWe manually pick the threshold\nt=3.0 for a good balance between generation\nquality and coverage. Examples (1) and (2) in Table 2 are representative examples from this generation method.\n1We pick this threshold to achieve about 95% precision.\n2In a preliminary stage, we noticed that many pairs were\nsimply a permutation of a list, like \u201cA and B\u201d changed to\n\u201cB and A\u201d. For the diversity of the dataset, 99% of these are\npruned via hand-crafted, heuristic rules.\n\fSentence 1\nSentence 2\nGeneration Type\n(1) Can a bad person become good?\nCan a good person become bad?\nAdjective swap\n(2) Jerry looks over Tom\u2019s shoulder and gets\npunched.\nTom looks over Jerry\u2019s shoulder and gets\npunched.\nNamed entity swap\n(3) The team also toured in Australia in 1953.\nIn 1953, the team also toured in Australia.\nTemporal phrase swap\n(4) Erikson formed the rock band Spooner with\ntwo fellow musicians.\nErikson founded the rock band Spooner with\ntwo fellow musicians.\nWord replacement\nTable 2: Examples of typical types of generation. (1) and (2) are from the word swapping method, while (3) and\n(4) are from the back translation method. Boldface indicates changes in each example.\n3.2\nBack Translation\nBecause word order impacts meaning, especially\nin English, the swapping method tends to produce non-paraphrases.\nOur preliminary results\nshowed that the distribution of paraphrase to nonparaphrases from this method is highly imbalanced (about 1:4 ratio).\nHowever, we seek to\ncreate a balanced dataset, so we use an additional strategy based on back translation\u2014which\nhas the opposite label distribution and also produces greater diversity of paraphrases while still\nmaintaining a high BOW overlap.\nThe back translation method takes a sentence\npair and label (s1, s2, l) as input. For each sentence, the top-k translations are obtained from an\nEnglish-German neural machine translation model\n(NMT); then each of these is translated back to English using another German-English NMT model,\nproviding a resulting top-k results. We chose German as the pivot language because it produced\nmore word reordering variations than other languages and the translation quality was good. Both\nmodels have the same architecture (Wu et al.,\n2016) and are trained on WMT14. This results\nin k2 back translations before deduplication. We\nchose k=5. To obtain more pairs with the PAWS\nproperty, we further filter back translations by\ntheir BOW similarities to the input and their wordorder inversion rates, as described below.\nWe define BOW similarity as the cosine similarity \u03b1 between the word count vectors of a sentence\npair. Pairs generated from the swapping strategy\nhave score \u03b1 = 1.0, but here we relax the threshold to 0.9 because it brings more data diversity\nand higher coverage, while still generating paraphrases of the input with high quality.\nTo define the word-order inversion rate, we first\ncompute word alignments between a sentence pair\nin a heuristic way by assuming they are one-to-one\nmapping and are always monotonic. For example,\nif the first sentence has three instances of dog and\nOn     April   2    Jenkins    married   Ivy   Vujic\nJenkins     married     Ivy     on     April     2 \nFigure 3: An example of how to compute inversion\nrate.\nthe second has two, we align the first two instances\nof dog in the same order and skip the third one.\nThe inversion rate is then computed as the ratio of\ncross alignments. Figure 3 is an example pair with\nsix alignments. There are 15 alignment pairs in\ntotal and 9 of them are crossed, e.g. alignments\nof on and married. The inversion rate of this example is therefore 9/15 = 0.6. We sample back\ntranslation results such that at least half of the pairs\nhave inversion rate over 0.02; this way, the final\nselected pairs cover interesting transformations of\nboth word-order changes and word replacement.\nExamples (3) and (4) in Table 2 are representative\nexamples from back translation.\nLabel Balancing\nFigure 1 illustrates the process of constructing the final label-balanced set\nbased on human annotations.\nThe set first includes all pairs from back translation, which are\nmostly paraphrases. For each labeled pair (s1, s2)\nfrom swapping and a labeled pair (s1, s\u2032\n1) from\nback translation, the set further includes the pair\n(s2, s\u2032\n1) based on the rules: (1) (s2, s\u2032\n1) is paraphrase if both (s1, s2) and (s1, s\u2032\n1) are paraphrases; (2) (s2, s\u2032\n1) is non-paraphrase if exactly\none of (s1, s2) and (s1, s\u2032\n1) is non-paraphrase; (3)\notherwise (s2, s\u2032\n1) is not included because its label\nis unknown. We also consider pairs (s\u2032\n2, s1) and\n(s\u2032\n2, s\u2032\n1) in the similar way if s\u2032\n2 is a back translation of s2 with human labels.\n4\nPAWS Dataset\nUsing the example generation strategies described\nin Section 3 combined with human paraphrase an-\n\fQuora\nWikipedia\n# Raw pairs\n16,280\n50,000\nSentence correction\n# Accepted pairs\n10,699\n39,903\n# Fixed pairs\n3,626\n7,387\n# Rejected pairs\n1,955\n2,710\nParaphrase identification\nTotal # pairs\n14,325\n47,290\nparaphrase\n4,693\n5,725\nnon-paraphrase\n9,632\n41,565\nHuman agreement\n92.0%\n94.7%\nAfter post-filtering\nTotal # pairs\n12,665\n43,647\nHuman agreement\n95.8%\n97.5%\nTable 3: Detailed counts for examples created via the\nswapping strategy, followed by human filtering and\nparaphrase judgments.\nnotations, we create a large new dataset, PAWS\nthat contains both paraphrase and non-paraphrase\npairs that have both high bag-of-words overlap and\nword reordering. Source sentences are drawn from\nboth the Quora Question Pairs (QQP) corpus (Iyer\net al., 2017) and Wikipedia.3 From these, we produce two datasets, PAWSQQP and PAWSWiki.\nWe start by producing swapped examples from\nboth QQP and Wikipedia. Both sources contain\nnaturally occurring sentences covering many topics.\nOn both corpora only about 3% of candidates are selected for further processing\u2014the rest\nare filtered because there is no valid generation\ncandidate that satisfies all swapping constraints\nor because the language model score of the best\ncandidate is below the threshold. The remaining\npairs (16,280 for QQP and 50k for Wikipedia) are\npassed to human review.\nSentence correction\nThe examples generated\nusing both of our strategies are generally of high\nquality, but they still need to be checked with respect to grammar and coherence. Annotators evaluate each generated sentence without seeing its\nsource sentence. The sentence is accepted as is,\nfixed, or rejected. Table 3 shows the number of\npairs of each action on each domain. Most of fixes\nare minor grammar corrections like a apple\u2192an\napple.\nAccepted and fixed sentences are then\npassed to the next stage for paraphrase annotation.\n3https://dumps.wikimedia.org\nTotal # back translation pairs\n26,897\nparaphrase\n25,521\nnon-paraphrase\n1,376\nHuman agreement\n94.8%\nTable 4: Paraphrase judgments on example pairs generated by back translation on Wikipedia sentences.\nOverall 88% of generated examples passed the human correction phase on both domains.\nParaphrase identification\nSentence pairs are\npresented to five annotators, each of which gives\na binary judgment as to whether they are paraphrases or not. We choose binary judgments to\nmake our dataset have the same label schema\nas the QQP corpus.\nTable 3 shows aggregated\nannotation statistics on both domains, including\nthe number of paraphrase (positive) and nonparaphrase (negative) pairs and human agreement,\nwhich is the percentage ratio of agreement between each individual label and the majority vote\nof five labels on each example pair. Overall, human agreement is high on both Quora (92.0%) and\nWikipedia (94.7%) and each label only takes about\n24 seconds. As such, answers are usually straightforward to human raters.\nTo ensure the data is comprised of clearly paraphrase or non-paraphrase pairs, only examples\nwith four or five raters agreeing are kept.4 An example of low agreement is Why is the 20th-century\nmusic so different from the 21st music? v.s. Why\nis the 21st century music so different from the 20th\ncentury music?, where three out of five raters gave\nnegative labels on this pair. The bottom block of\nTable 3 shows the final number of pairs after this\nfiltering, and human agreement further goes up to\nover 95%. Finally, source and generated sentences\nare randomly flipped to mask their provenance.\nThe swapping strategy generally produces nonparaphrase examples\u201467% for QQP and 88% for\nWikipedia.\nBecause (a) the label imbalance is\nless pronounced for QQP and (b) NMT models\nperform poorly on Quora questions due to domain mismatch, we only apply the back translation strategy to Wikipedia pairs. Doing so creates\n26,897 candidate example pairs after filtering. As\nbefore, each pair is rated by five annotators on the\nparaphrase identification task.5 Table 4 shows that\n4We exclude low agreement pairs from our experiments,\nbut we include them in our data release for further study.\n5Sentence correction was not necessary for these because\n\fTrain\nDev\nTest\nYes%\nPAWSQQP\n11,988\n677\n\u2013 31.3%\nPAWSWiki\n49,401 8,000 8,000 44.2%\nPAWSWiki-Swap 30,397\n\u2013\n\u2013\n9.6%\nTable 5: Counts of experimental split for each PAWS\ndataset. The final column gives the proportion of paraphrase (positive) pairs. There are 108,463 PAWS pairs\nin total.\nmost of the examples (94.9%) are paraphrases (as\nexpected), with high human agreement (94.8%).\nFinally, we expand the pairs using the the rules\ndescribed in Section 3.2.\nTable 5 provides counts for each split in the final\nPAWS datasets. The training portion of PAWSQQP\nis a subset of the QQP training set; however,\nPAWSQQP\u2019s development set is a subset of both\nQQP\u2019s development and test sets because there are\nonly 677 pairs. PAWSWiki randomly draws 8,000\npairs for each of its development and test sets and\ntakes the rest as its training set, with no overlap of\nsource sentences across sets. Finally, any trivial\npairs with identical sentences from development\nand test sets are removed.6 The final PAWSQQP\nhas a total of 12,665 pairs (443k tokens), where\n31.3% of them have positive labels (paraphrases).\nPAWSWiki has a total of 65,401 pairs (2.8m tokens), where 44.2% of them are paraphrases.\nNote that we have human annotations on 43k\npairs generated by the word swapping method on\nWikipedia, but 30k of them have no back translation counterparts and therefore they are not included in our final PAWSWiki dataset. Nevertheless, they are high-quality pairs with manual labels, so we include them as an auxiliary training\nset (PAWSWiki-Swap in Table 5), and empirically\nshow its impact in Section 6.\nUnlabeled PAWSWiki\nIn addition to the fully labeled PAWSWiki dataset, we also construct an unlabeled PAWSWiki set at large scale. The idea is to\nsimply treat all pairs from word swapping as nonparaphrases and all pairs from back translation as\nparaphrase, and construct the dataset in the same\nway as labeled PAWSWiki. The result is a total of\n656k pairs with silver labels. We show empirically\nNMT generates fluent output.\n6Such trivial examples exist because annotators sometimes fix a swapped sentence back to its source. We keep\nsuch examples in the training set (about 8% of the corpus)\nbecause otherwise a trained model would actually predict low\nsimilarity scores to identical pairs.\nBOW\nBiLSTM\n& ESIM\nDecAtt\nDIIN &\nBERT\nNon-local context\n\u00d7\n\u2713\n\u00d7\n\u2713\nWord interaction\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u2713\n\u2713\nTable 6: Complexity of each evaluated model.\nthe impact of using this silver set in pre-training in\nSection 6.\n5\nEvaluated Models\nPAWS is designed to probe models\u2019 ability to\ngo beyond recognizing overall sentence similarity or relatedness. As noted in the introduction,\nmodels\u2014even the best avaliable\u2014trained on existing resources tend to classify any example with\nhigh BOW overlap as a paraphrase. Can any of\nthese models learn finer structural sensitivity when\nprovided with PAWS examples as part of their\ntraining?\nWe consider six different models that cover a\nwide range of complexity and expressiveness: two\nbaseline encoders and four recent advanced models that achieved state-of-the-art or strong performance on paraphrase identification.\nTable 6\nsummarizes the models with respect to whether\nthey represent non-local contexts or support crosssentential word interaction.\nThe baseline models use cosine similarity with\nsimple sentence encoders: a bag-of-words (BOW)\nencoder based on token unigram and bigram encodings and a bi-directional LSTM (BiLSTM)\nthat produces a contextualized sentence encoding.\nA cosine value above .5 is taken as a paraphrase.\nESIM. The Enhanced Sequential Inference\nModel (Chen et al., 2017) achieved competitive\nperformance on eight sentence pair modeling tasks\n(Lan and Xu, 2018).\nIt encodes each sentence\nusing a BiLSTM, concatenates the encodings for\neach sentence in the pair, and passes them through\na multi-layer perceptron (MLP) for classification.\nThe additional layers allow ESIM to capture more\ncomplex sentence interaction than cosine similarity in the baseline models.\nDecAtt. The Decomposable Attention Model\n(Parikh et al., 2016) is one of the earliest models to introduce attention for paraphrase identification. It computes word pair interaction between\ntwo sentences and aggregates aligned vectors for\nfinal classification. This model achieved state-ofthe-art results without explicitly modeling word\n\forder. In our experiments, we show the limitations\nof this modeling choice on PAWS pairs.\nDIIN. The Densely Interactive Inference Network (Gong et al., 2018) adopts DenseNet (Huang\net al., 2017), a 2-dimensional convolution architecture, to extract high-order word-by-word interaction between n-gram pairs.\nThis model\nachieved state-of-the-art performance without relying on pre-trained deep contextualized representations like ELMo (Peters et al., 2018). It outperformed ESIM and DecAtt models by a large margin on both paraphrase identification and natural\nlanguage inference tasks.\nBERT. The Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (Devlin et al., 2018)\nrecently obtained new state-of-the-art results on\neleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE benchmark to 80.4% (7.6%\nabsolute improvement).\nBERT involves pretraining a Transformer encoder (Vaswani et al.,\n2017) on a large corpus with over three billion\nwords. This large network is then fine-tuned with\njust one additional output layer.\n6\nExperiments\nWe seek to understand how well models trained\non standard datasets perform on PAWS pairs and\nto see which models are most able to learn from\nPAWS pairs.\nA strong model should improve\nsignificantly on PAWS when trained on PAWS\npairs without diminishing performance on existing\ndatasets like QQP. Overall, both DIIN and BERT\nprove remarkably able to adapt to PAWS pairs and\nperform well on both PAWSQQP and PAWSWiki\nwhile the other models prove far less capable.\n6.1\nExperimental Setup\nWe use two metrics: classification accuracy and\narea-under-curve (AUC) scores of precision-recall\ncurves. For all classification models, 0.5 is the\nthreshold used to compute accuracy. We report results on testing sets for QQP and PAWSWiki, and\non the development set for PAWSQQP (which has\nno test set).\nFor BERT, we use the implementation provided\nby the authors7 and apply their default fine-tuning\nconfiguration.\nWe use the provided BERTBASE\npre-trained model instead of BERTLARGE due to\nGPU memory limitations. For all other models,\nwe use our own (re-)implementations that matched\n7https://github.com/google-research/bert\nreported performance on QQP. We use 300 dimensional GloVe embeddings (Pennington et al.,\n2014) to represent words and fix them during training.\n6.2\nResults\nMain Results on PAWSQQP\nTable 7 summarizes results on the Quora domain. We first train\nmodels on the Quora Question Pairs (QQP) training set, and column \u201cQQP\u2192QQP\u201d shows that all\nmodels achieve over 83% accuracy on QQP. However, when evaluating on PAWSQQP, all models,\nincluding BERT, obtain abysmal accuracy under\n40% (column \u201cQQP\u2192PAWSQQP\u201d).\nWe hypothesize the performance on PAWSQQP\nrelies on two factors: the number of representative\ntraining examples, and the capability of models\nto represent complex interactions between words\nin each sentence and across the sentences in the\npair. To verify that, we further train models on a\ncombination of QQP and PAWSQQP training sets\nand the last two columns of Table 7 show the results on PAWSQQP. As expected, all models benefit from new training examples, but to different\nextents. Gains are much larger on state-of-the-art\nmodels like BERT, while the BOW model learns\nalmost nothing from new examples.\nAs a consequence, performance changes are more drastic\non PAWSQQP than on QQP. For example, the absolute difference between BiLSTM and BERT is\n4.2% on QQP, but it goes up to 27% on PAWSQQP,\nwhich is a 60% relative reduction in error.\nIt is also noteworthy that adding PAWSQQP\ntraining examples has no negative impact to QQP\nperformance at all. For example, a BERT model\nfine-tuned on QQP+PAWSQQP achieves the same\n90.5% classification accuracy as training on QQP\nalone. We therefore obtain a single model that performs well on both datasets.\nMain Results on PAWSWiki\nIn our second experiment we train and evaluate models on our\nPAWSWiki dataset. Table 8 presents the results.\nDIIN and BERT outperform others by a substantial margin (>17% accuracy gains). This observation gives more evidence that PAWS data effectively measures models\u2019 sensitivity to word order\nand syntactic structure.\nOne interesting observation is that DecAtt performs as poorly as BOW on this dataset. This is\nlikely due to the fact that DecAtt and BOW both\nconsider only local context information.

As Table 9 shows,\nadding this auxiliary training set is particularly\nhelpful to the performance on PAWSQQP, yielding\na 12.1% (70.6% vs 58.5%) gain on AUC when\ntraining on QQP+PAWSWiki. On PAWSWiki, this\naddition lifts the (no pre-training) DIIN model\nAUC from 91.1% (Table 8) to 93.8% (Table 9).\nBERT vs DIIN\nBoth models achieve top scores\non PAWS, but interestingly, the two models disagree on many pairs and are not correlated in their\nerrors. For example, of 687 of BERT\u2019s mistakes\non the PAWSWiki test set, DIIN got 280 (41%) correct. As such, performance might improve with\ncombinations of these two existing models.\nIt is also worth noting that the DIIN model used\nin our experiments has only 590k model parameters, whereas BERT has over 100m.\nFurthermore, the computational cost of BERT is notably\nhigher than DIIN. Given this, and the fact that\nDIIN is competitive with BERT (especially when\npre-trained on noisy pairs, see Table 8), DIIN is\nlikely the better choice in computationally constrained scenarios\u2014especially those with strict latency requirements.\n7\nConclusion\nDatasets are insufficient for differentiating models\nif they lack examples that exhibit the necessary diagnostic phenomena. This has led, for example,\nto new datasets for noun-verb ambiguity (Elkahky\net al., 2018) and gender bias in coreference (Webster et al., 2018; Rudinger et al., 2018; Jieyu Zhao,\n2018). Our new PAWS datasets join these efforts\nand provide a new resource for training and evaluating paraphrase identifiers. We show that including PAWS training data for state-of-the-art models\ndramatically improves their performance on challenging examples and makes them more robust to\nreal world examples. We also demonstrate that\nPAWS effectively measures sensitivity of models\non word order and syntactic structure.\nAcknowledgement\nWe would like to thank our anonymous reviewers and the Google AI Language team, especially\nEmily Pitler, for the insightful comments that contributed to this paper.\nMany thanks also to the\nData Compute team, especially Ashwin Kakarla\nand Henry Jicha, for their help with the annotations\nReferences\nMoustafa Alzantot, Yash Sharma, Ahmed Elgohary,\nBo-Jhang Ho, Mani Srivastava, and Kai-Wei Chang.\n2018.

Models trained on such data fail to distinguish pairs like _flights from New York to Florida_ and _flights from Florida to New York_. This paper introduces PAWS (**P**a**raphrase **A**dversaries from **W**ord **S**crambling), a new dataset with 108,463 well-formed paraphrase and non-paraphrase pairs with high lexical overlap. Challenging pairs are generated by controlled word swapping and back translation, followed by fluency and paraphrase judgments by human raters. State-of-the-art models trained on existing datasets have dismal performance on PAWS (\\(<\\)40% accuracy); however, including PAWS training data for these models improves their accuracy to 85% while maintaining performance on existing tasks. In contrast, models that do not capture non-local contextual information fail even with PAWS training examples. As such, PAWS provides an effective instrument for driving further progress on models that better exploit structure, context, and pairwise comparisons.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nWord order and syntactic structure have a large impact on sentence meaning. Even small perturbation in word order can completely change interpretation. Consider the following related sentences.\n\n1. Flights from New York to Florida.\n2. Flights to Florida from NYC.\n3. Flights from Florida to New York.\n\nAll three have high bag-of-words (BOW) overlap. However, (2) is a paraphrase of (1), while (3) has a very different meaning from (1).\n\nExisting datasets lack non-paraphrase pairs like (1) and (3). The Quora Question Pairs (QQP) corpus contains 400k real world pairs, but its negative examples are drawn primarily from related questions. Few have high word overlap, and of the \\(\\sim\\)1,000 pairs with the same BOW, only 20% are not paraphrases. This provides insufficient representative examples to evaluate models' performance on this problem, and there are too few examples for models to learn the importance of word order. Table 1 shows that models trained on QQP are inclined to mark any sentence pairs with high word overlap as paraphrases despite clear clashes in meaning. Models trained or evaluated with only this data may not perform well on real world tasks where such sensitivity is important.\n\nTo address this, we introduce a workflow (outlined in Figure 1) for generating pairs of sentences that have high word overlap, but which are balanced with respect to whether they are paraphrases or not. Using this process, we create PAWS (**P**a**raphrase **A**dversaries from **W**ord **S**crambling), a dataset constructed from sentences in Quora and\n\nFigure 1: PAWS corpus creation workflow.\n\nWikipedia. Examples are generated from controlled language models and back translation, and given five human ratings each in both phases. A final rule recombines annotated examples and balances the labels. Our final PAWS dataset will be released publicly with 108,463 pairs at [https://g.co/dataset/paws](https://g.co/dataset/paws).\n\nWe show that existing state-of-the-art models fail miserably on PAWS when trained on existing resources, but some perform well when given PAWS training examples. BERT Devlin et al. (2018) fine-tuned on QQP achieves over 90% accuracy on QQP, but only 33% accuracy on PAWS data in the same domain. However, the accuracy on PAWS boosts to 85% by including 12k PAWS training pairs (without reducing QQP performance). Table 1 also shows that the new model is able to correctly classify challenging pairs. Annotation scale is also important: our learning curves show strong models like BERT improve with tens of thousands of training examples.\n\nOur experimental results also demonstrate that PAWS effectively measures sensitivity of models to word order and structure. Unlike BERT, a simple BOW model fails to learn from PAWS training examples, demonstrating its weakness at capturing non-local contextual information. Our experiments show that the gains from PAWS examples correlate with the complexity of models.\n\n## 2 Related Work\n\nExisting data creation techniques have focused on collecting paraphrases, e.g. from co-captions for images Lin et al. (2014), tweets with shared URLs Lan et al. (2017), subtitles Creutz (2018), and back translation Iyyer et al. (2018). Unlike all previous work, we emphasize the collection of challenging negative examples.\n\nOur work closely relates to the idea of crafting adversarial examples to break NLP systems. Existing approaches mostly focused on adding label-preserving perturbations to inputs, but with the effect of distracting systems from correct answers. Example perturbation rules include adding noise to inputs Jia and Liang (2017); Chen et al. (2018), word replacements Alzantot et al. (2018); Ribeiro et al. (2018), and syntactic transformation Iyyer et al. (2018). A notable exception is Glockner et al. Glockner et al. (2018): they generated both entailment and contradiction examples by replacing words with their synonyms or antonyms. Our work presents two main departures. We propose a novel method that generates challenging examples with balanced class labels and more word reordering variations than previous work. In addition, we release to public a large set of 108k example pairs with high-quality human labels. We believe the new dataset will benefit future research on both adversarial example generation and improvement of model robustness.\n\nIn our work, we demonstrate the importance of capturing non-local contextual information in the problem of paraphrase identification. This relates to prior work on probing sentence representations for their linguistic properties, such as how much syntactic information is encoded in representations Conneau et al. (2018); Tenney et al. (2018),\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{p{142.3pt} p{142.3pt} p{142.3pt} p{142.3pt} p{142.3pt} p{142.3pt}} \\hline \\hline \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Sentence 1} & \\multicolumn{1}{p{142.3pt}}{Sentence 2} & \\multicolumn{1}{p{142.3pt}}{Gold} & \\multicolumn{1}{p{142.3pt}}{BOW} & \\multicolumn{1}{p{142.3pt}}{BERT+PAWS} \\\\ \\hline (1) & Can a bad person become good? & Can a good person become bad? & N & Y & Y & N \\\\ (2) & Which is the cheapest flight from anywhere in South America to Europe? & N & Y & N & N \\\\ (3) & \u201cTaunton Castle\u201d was on August 1 in Rio de Janeiro and on October 31 in Penang. & N & Y & Y & N \\\\ (4) & Although interchangeable, the body pieces on the 2 cars are not similar. & N & Y & Y & N \\\\ (5) & Katz was born in Sweden in 1947 and moved to New York City at the age of 1. & Y & Y & Y & Y \\\\ (6) & It was not the sales manager who hit the bottle that day, but the office worker with the serious drinking problem. & N & Y & Y & N \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: Paraphrase/Non-paraphrase (Y/N) pairs with high bag-of-words (BOW) overlap. (1)-(5) are drawn from PAWS, and (6) is from Mitchell and Lapata Mitchell and Lapata (2008). Both a simple BOW and the state-of-the-art BERT Devlin et al. (2018) models, if trained/fine-tuned on the Quora Question Pairs (QQP) corpus, classify all of them (with one exception) as paraphrases (Y). A BERT model fine-tuned on both QQP and PAWS examples (BERT+PAWS), however, is able to get them correct.\n\n2019; Ettinger et al., 2018). There also exists prior work that directly uses structural information in modeling (Filice et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2018). All these prior approaches were evaluated on existing datasets. In contrast, we perform studies on PAWS, a new dataset that emphasizes the importance of capturing structural information in representation learning. While developing new models is beyond the scope of this paper, this new dataset can facilitate research in this direction.\n\n## 3 PAWS Example Generation\n\nWe define a **PAWS pair** to be a pair of sentences with high bag-of-words (BOW) overlap but different word order. In the Quora Question Pairs corpus, 80% of such pairs are paraphrases. Here, we describe a method to automatically generate non-trivial and well-formed PAWS pairs from real-world text in any domain (this section), and then have them annotated by human raters (Section 4).\n\nOur automatic generation method is based on two ideas. The first swaps words to generate a sentence pair with the same BOW, controlled by a language model. The second uses back translation to generate paraphrases with high BOW overlap but different word order. These two strategies generate high-quality, diverse PAWS pairs, balanced evenly between paraphrases and non-paraphrases.\n\n### Word Swapping\n\nOur first phase generates well-formed sentences by swapping words in real world text. Most text generation models rely on large amount of training data (Iyyer et al., 2018; Guu et al., 2018; Gupta et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018), which is unfortunately not available in our case. We thus propose a novel generation method based on language modeling and constrained beam search. The goal is to find a sentence that achieves high language model score as well as satisfying all constraints. High scores indicate that generated sentences are natural and well-formed, and constraints ensure generated pairs have the same BOW.\n\nFigure 2 illustrates the generation procedure. First, given an input sentence, a CRF-based part-of-speech tagger tags each word. We further detect person names, locations, and organizations using a named entity recognizer, and replace POS with entity tags if probability scores are above 95%.1 The sequence of tags of words and phrases form a template for the input.\n\nFootnote 1: We pick this threshold to achieve about 95% precision.\n\nOur beam search method then fills in each slot of the template from left to right, scoring each state by a language model trained on one billion words (Chelba et al., 2014). The candidate words and phrases for each slot are drawn from the input based on its tag. In Figure 2, for example, the second slot must be filled with a Location from two candidate _New York_ and _Florida_. Candidates are drawn without replacement so the generated sentence and the input have exactly the same bag-of-words. Note that this template-based constraint is more restrictive than the BOW requirement, but we choose it because it significantly reduces the search space. With this constraint, the method achieves high generation quality without a large beam. In practice, beam size is set to 100, which produces near-optimal results in most cases.\n\nLet \\(s^{\\prime}\\) be the best sentence in the beam other than the input sentence \\(s\\), and \\(LM(\\cdot)\\) be their log-likelihood by the language model. We take \\((s,s^{\\prime})\\) as a good word-swapping pair if \\(LM(s^{\\prime})\\geq LM(s)-t\\).2 We manually pick the threshold \\(t{=}3.0\\) for a good balance between generation quality and coverage. Examples (1) and (2) in Table 2 are representative examples from this generation method.\n\nFootnote 2: In a preliminary stage, we noticed that many pairs were simply a permutation of a list, like \u201cA and B\u201d changed to \u201cB and A\u201d. For the diversity of the dataset, 99% of these are pruned via hand-crafted, heuristic rules.\n\nFigure 2: Illustration of the generation method in three steps. (a) Tag words and phrases with part-of-speech (POS) and named entities. (b) Build candidate sets by grouping words and phrases with the same tag. (c) Under the constraints of tag sequence template and candidate sets, find sentences with high language model scores using beam search.\n\n### Back Translation\n\nBecause word order impacts meaning, especially in English, the swapping method tends to produce non-paraphrases. Our preliminary results showed that the distribution of paraphrase to non-paraphrases from this method is highly imbalanced (about 1:4 ratio). However, we seek to create a balanced dataset, so we use an additional strategy based on back translation--which has the opposite label distribution and also produces greater diversity of paraphrases while still maintaining a high BOW overlap.\n\nThe back translation method takes a sentence pair and label \\((s_{1},s_{2},l)\\) as input. For each sentence, the top-\\(k\\) translations are obtained from an English-German neural machine translation model (NMT); then each of these is translated back to English using another German-English NMT model, providing a resulting top-\\(k\\) results. We chose German as the pivot language because it produced more word reordering variations than other languages and the translation quality was good. Both models have the same architecture Wu et al. (2016) and are trained on WMT14. This results in \\(k^{2}\\) back translations before deduplication. We chose \\(k{=}5\\). To obtain more pairs with the PAWS property, we further filter back translations by their BOW similarities to the input and their word-order inversion rates, as described below.\n\nWe define BOW similarity as the cosine similarity \\(\\alpha\\) between the word count vectors of a sentence pair. Pairs generated from the swapping strategy have score \\(\\alpha=1.0\\), but here we relax the threshold to 0.9 because it brings more data diversity and higher coverage, while still generating paraphrases of the input with high quality.\n\nTo define the word-order inversion rate, we first compute word alignments between a sentence pair in a heuristic way by assuming they are one-to-one mapping and are always monotonic. For example, if the first sentence has three instances of _dog_ and the second has two, we align the first two instances of _dog_ in the same order and skip the third one. The inversion rate is then computed as the ratio of cross alignments. Figure 3 is an example pair with six alignments. There are 15 alignment pairs in total and 9 of them are crossed, e.g. alignments of _on_ and _married_. The inversion rate of this example is therefore \\(9/15=0.6\\). We sample back translation results such that at least half of the pairs have inversion rate over 0.02; this way, the final selected pairs cover interesting transformations of both word-order changes and word replacement. Examples (3) and (4) in Table 2 are representative examples from back translation.\n\nLabel BalancingFigure 1 illustrates the process of constructing the final label-balanced set based on human annotations. The set first includes all pairs from back translation, which are mostly paraphrases. For each labeled pair \\((s_{1},s_{2})\\) from swapping and a labeled pair \\((s_{1},s^{\\prime}_{1})\\) from back translation, the set further includes the pair \\((s_{2},s^{\\prime}_{1})\\) based on the rules: (1) \\((s_{2},s^{\\prime}_{1})\\) is paraphrase if both \\((s_{1},s_{2})\\) and \\((s_{1},s^{\\prime}_{1})\\) are paraphrases; (2) \\((s_{2},s^{\\prime}_{1})\\) is non-paraphrase if exactly one of \\((s_{1},s_{2})\\) and \\((s_{1},s^{\\prime}_{1})\\) is non-paraphrase; (3) otherwise \\((s_{2},s^{\\prime}_{1})\\) is not included because its label is unknown. We also consider pairs \\((s^{\\prime}_{2},s_{1})\\) and \\((s^{\\prime}_{2},s^{\\prime}_{1})\\) in the similar way if \\(s^{\\prime}_{2}\\) is a back translation of \\(s_{2}\\) with human labels.\n\n## 4 PAWS Dataset\n\nUsing the example generation strategies described in Section 3 combined with human paraphrase an\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{p{142.3pt} p{142.3pt} p{142.3pt}} \\hline \\hline Sentence 1 & Sentence 2 & Generation Type \\\\ \\hline (1) Can a **bad** person become **good?** (2) **Jerry** looks over **Tom**\u2019s shoulder and gets punched.

Boldface indicates changes in each example.\n\nFigure 3: An example of how to compute inversion rate.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:5]\n\nmost of the examples (94.9%) are paraphrases (as expected), with high human agreement (94.8%). Finally, we expand the pairs using the the rules described in Section 3.2.\n\nFootnote 5: The \\(\\text{PAWS}_{\\text{QQP}}\\) is a subset of the QQP training set; however, \\(\\text{PAWS}_{\\text{QQP}}\\)\u2019s development set is a subset of both QQP's development and test sets because there are only 677 pairs. \\(\\text{PAWS}_{\\text{Wiki}}\\) randomly draws 8,000 pairs for each of its development and test sets and takes the rest as its training set, with no overlap of source sentences across sets. Finally, any trivial pairs with identical sentences from development and test sets are removed.6 The final \\(\\text{PAWS}_{\\text{QQP}}\\) has a total of 12,665 pairs (443k tokens), where 31.3% of them have positive labels (paraphrases). \\(\\text{PAWS}_{\\text{Wiki}}\\) has a total of 65,401 pairs (2.8m tokens), where 44.2% of them are paraphrases.\n\nFootnote 6: Such trivial examples exist because annotators sometimes fix a swapped sentence back to its source. We keep such examples in the training set (about 8% of the corpus) because otherwise a trained model would actually predict low similarity scores to identical pairs.\n\nNote that we have human annotations on 43k pairs generated by the word swapping method on Wikipedia, but 30k of them have no back translation counterparts and therefore they are not included in our final \\(\\text{PAWS}_{\\text{Wiki}}\\) dataset. Nevertheless, they are high-quality pairs with manual labels, so we include them as an auxiliary training set (\\(\\text{PAWS}_{\\text{Wiki-Swap}}\\) in Table 5), and empirically show its impact in Section 6.\n\nUnlabeled \\(\\text{PAWS}_{\\text{Wiki}}\\)In addition to the fully labeled \\(\\text{PAWS}_{\\text{Wiki}}\\) dataset, we also construct an unlabeled \\(\\text{PAWS}_{\\text{Wiki}}\\) set at large scale. The idea is to simply treat all pairs from word swapping as non-paraphrases and all pairs from back translation as paraphrase, and construct the dataset in the same way as labeled \\(\\text{PAWS}_{\\text{Wiki}}\\). The result is a total of 656k pairs with silver labels. We show empirically the impact of using this silver set in pre-training in Section 6.\n\n## 5 Evaluated Models\n\nPAWS is designed to probe models' ability to go beyond recognizing overall sentence similarity or relatedness. As noted in the introduction, models--even the best avaliable--trained on existing resources tend to classify any example with high BOW overlap as a paraphrase. Can any of these models learn finer structural sensitivity when provided with PAWS examples as part of their training?\n\nWe consider six different models that cover a wide range of complexity and expressiveness: two baseline encoders and four recent advanced models that achieved state-of-the-art or strong performance on paraphrase identification. Table 6 summarizes the models with respect to whether they represent non-local contexts or support cross-sentential word interaction.\n\nThe baseline models use cosine similarity with simple sentence encoders: a bag-of-words (**BOW**) encoder based on token unigram and bigram encodings and a bi-directional LSTM (**BiLSTM**) that produces a contextualized sentence encoding. A cosine value above.5 is taken as a paraphrase.\n\n**ESIM**. The Enhanced Sequential Inference Model (Chen et al., 2017) achieved competitive performance on eight sentence pair modeling tasks (Lan and Xu, 2018). It encodes each sentence using a BiLSTM, concatenates the encodings for each sentence in the pair, and passes them through a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) for classification. The additional layers allow ESIM to capture more complex sentence interaction than cosine similarity in the baseline models.\n\n**DecAtt**. The Decomposable Attention Model (Parikh et al., 2016) is one of the earliest models to introduce attention for paraphrase identification. It computes word pair interaction between two sentences and aggregates aligned vectors for final classification. This model achieved state-of-the-art results without explicitly modeling word\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c c}  & \\multirow{2}{*}{BOW} & BiLSTM & \\multirow{2}{*}{DecAtt} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{DIIN \\&} \\\\  & & \\& ESIM & & BERT \\\\ \\hline Non-local context & \\(\\times\\) & \u2713 & \\(\\times\\) & \u2713 \\\\ Word interaction & \\(\\times\\) & \\(\\times\\) & \u2713 & \u2713 \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 6: Complexity of each evaluated model.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l r r r r}  & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{Train} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{Dev} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{Test} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{Yes\\%} \\\\ \\hline \\(\\text{PAWS}_{\\text{QQP}}\\) & 11,988 & 677 & \u2013 & 31.3\\% \\\\ \\(\\text{PAWS}_{\\text{Wiki}}\\) & 49,401 & 8,000 & 8,000 & 44.2\\% \\\\ \\(\\text{PAWS}_{\\text{Wiki-Swap}}\\) & 30,397 & \u2013 & \u2013 & 9.6\\% \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 5: Counts of experimental split for each PAWS dataset. The final column gives the proportion of paraphrase (positive) pairs. There are 108,463 PAWS pairs in total.\n\norder. In our experiments, we show the limitations of this modeling choice on PAWS pairs.\n\n**DIIN**. The Densely Interactive Inference Network Gong et al. (2018) adopts DenseNet Huang et al. (2017), a 2-dimensional convolution architecture, to extract high-order word-by-word interaction between n-gram pairs. This model achieved state-of-the-art performance without relying on pre-trained deep contextualized representations like ELMo Peters et al. (2018). It outperformed ESIM and DecAtt models by a large margin on both paraphrase identification and natural language inference tasks.\n\n**BERT**. The Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers Devlin et al. (2018) recently obtained new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE benchmark to 80.4% (7.6% absolute improvement). BERT involves pre-training a Transformer encoder Vaswani et al. (2017) on a large corpus with over three billion words. This large network is then fine-tuned with just one additional output layer.\n\n## 6 Experiments\n\nWe seek to understand how well models trained on standard datasets perform on PAWS pairs and to see which models are most able to learn from PAWS pairs. A strong model should improve significantly on PAWS when trained on PAWS pairs without diminishing performance on existing datasets like QQP. Overall, both DIIN and BERT prove remarkably able to adapt to PAWS pairs and perform well on both PAWS\\({}_{\\text{QQP}}\\) and PAWS\\({}_{\\text{Wiki}}\\) while the other models prove far less capable.\n\n### Experimental Setup\n\nWe use two metrics: classification accuracy and area-under-curve (AUC) scores of precision-recall curves. For all classification models, 0.5 is the threshold used to compute accuracy. We report results on testing sets for QQP and PAWS\\({}_{\\text{Wiki}}\\), and on the development set for PAWS\\({}_{\\text{QQP}}\\) (which has no test set).\n\nFor BERT, we use the implementation provided by the authors7 and apply their default fine-tuning configuration. We use the provided BERT\\({}_{\\text{BASE}}\\) pre-trained model instead of BERT\\({}_{\\text{LARGE}}\\) due to GPU memory limitations. For all other models, we use our own (re-)implementations that matched reported performance on QQP. We use 300 dimensional GloVe embeddings Pennington et al. (2014) to represent words and fix them during training.\n\nFootnote 7: [https://github.com/google-research/bert](https://github.com/google-research/bert)\n\n### Results\n\n**Main Results on PAWS\\({}_{\\text{QQP}}\\)** Table 7 summarizes results on the Quora domain. We first train models on the Quora Question Pairs (QQP) training set, and column \"QQP\\(\\rightarrow\\)QQP\" shows that all models achieve over 83% accuracy on QQP. However, when evaluating on PAWS\\({}_{\\text{QQP}}\\), all models, including BERT, obtain abysmal accuracy under 40% (column \"QQP\\(\\rightarrow\\)PAWS\\({}_{\\text{QQP}}\\)\").\n\nWe hypothesize the performance on PAWS\\({}_{\\text{QQP}}\\) relies on two factors: the number of representative training examples, and the capability of models to represent complex interactions between words in each sentence and across the sentences in the pair. To verify that, we further train models on a combination of QQP and PAWS\\({}_{\\text{QQP}}\\) training sets and the last two columns of Table 7 show the results on PAWS\\({}_{\\text{QQP}}\\). As expected, all models benefit from new training examples, but to different extents. Gains are much larger on state-of-the-art models like BERT, while the BOW model learns almost nothing from new examples. As a consequence, performance changes are more drastic on PAWS\\({}_{\\text{QQP}}\\) than on QQP. For example, the absolute difference between BiLSTM and BERT is 4.2% on QQP, but it goes up to 27% on PAWS\\({}_{\\text{QQP}}\\), which is a 60% relative reduction in error.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that adding PAWS\\({}_{\\text{QQP}}\\) training examples has no negative impact to QQP performance at all. For example, a BERT model fine-tuned on QQP+PAWS\\({}_{\\text{QQP}}\\) achieves the same 90.5% classification accuracy as training on QQP alone. We therefore obtain a single model that performs well on both datasets.\n\n**Main Results on PAWS\\({}_{\\text{Wiki}}\\)** In our second experiment we train and evaluate models on our PAWS\\({}_{\\text{Wiki}}\\) dataset. Table 8 presents the results. DIIN and BERT outperform others by a substantial margin (\\(>\\)17% accuracy gains). This observation gives more evidence that PAWS data effectively measures models' sensitivity to word order and syntactic structure.\n\nOne interesting observation is that DecAtt performs as poorly as BOW on this dataset. This is likely due to the fact that DecAtt and BOW both consider only local context information. We there fore tested an enhancement of DecAtt by replacing its word representations with encodings from a BiLSTM encoder to capture non-local context information. The enhanced model significantly outperforms the base, yielding an 11.5% (57.1% vs. 68.6%) absolute gain on accuracy.\n\nWe further evaluate the impact of using silver PAWS\\({}_{\\text{Wiki}}\\) data in pre-training, as discussed in Section 4. The last two columns of Table 8 show the results. Comparing to supervised performance, pre-training with silver data gives consistent improvements across all models except BOW and vanilla DecAtt. Perhaps surprisingly, adding silver data gives more than 10% absolute improvements on AUC scores for BiLSTM and ESIM, much higher than the gains on DIIN and BERT.\n\nSize of Training SetTo analyze how many PAWS examples are sufficient for training, we train multiple models on QQP plus different number of PAWS\\({}_{\\text{QQP}}\\) examples. Figure 4 plots AUC score curves of DIIN and BERT as a function of the number of PAWS\\({}_{\\text{QQP}}\\) training examples. \\(x=0\\) corresponds to models trained on QQP only, and the rightmost points correspond to models trained on QQP and full PAWS\\({}_{\\text{QQP}}\\). Both models improve from 30% to 74% AUC scores with 6,000 PAWS\\({}_{\\text{QQP}}\\) examples. Furthermore, neither curve reaches convergence, so they would likely still benefit from more PAWS training examples.\n\nCross-domain ResultsThe PAWS datasets cover two domains: Quora and Wikipedia. Here we demonstrate that a model trained on one domain also generalizes to another domain, although not as well as training on in-domain data. Table 9 shows that a DIIN model trained on Quora (QQP+PAWS\\({}_{\\text{QQP}}\\)) achieves 70.5% AUC on the Wikipedia domain. This is lower than training on in-domain data (92.9%), but higher than the model trained without any PAWS data (46.0%). We also observe similar patterns when\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c} \\hline \\hline \\multirow{2}{*}{Models} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{QQP\\(\\rightarrow\\)QQP} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{QQP\\(\\rightarrow\\)PAWS\\({}_{\\text{QQP}}\\)} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{QQP+PAWS\\({}_{\\text{QQP}}\\)\\(\\rightarrow\\)PAWS\\({}_{\\text{QQP}}\\)} \\\\  & (Acc) & (AUC) & (Acc) & (AUC) & (Acc) & (AUC) \\\\ \\hline BOW & 83.2 & 89.5 & 29.0 & 27.1 & 30.0 (+1.0) & 27.3 (+0.2) \\\\ BiLSTM & 86.3 & 91.6 & 34.8 & **37.9** & 57.6 (+22.9) & 52.3 (+14.5) \\\\ ESIM (Chen et al., 2017) & 85.3 & 92.8 & **38.9** & 26.9 & 66.5 (+27.7) & 48.1 (+17.2) \\\\ DecAtt (Parikh et al., 2016) & 87.8 & 93.9 & 33.3 & 26.3 & 67.4 (+34.1) & 51.1 (+24.9) \\\\ DIIN (Gong et al., 2018) & 89.2 & 95.2 & 32.8 & 32.4 & 83.8 (+51.1) & 77.8 (+45.5) \\\\ BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) & **90.5** & **96.3** & 33.5 & 35.1 & **85.0** (+51.5) & **83.1** (+48.0) \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 7: **Accuracy (%) of classification and AUC scores (%) of precision-recall curves on Quora Question Pairs (QQP) testing set and our PAWS\\({}_{\\text{QQP}}\\) development set.

Interestingly, using out-of-domain data also boosts in-domain performance. As Table 9 shows, training on both domains (QQP+PAWS\\({}_{\\text{QQP+Wiki}}\\)) leads to 9.2% absolute AUC gains on PAWS\\({}_{\\text{QQP}}\\) over the model trained only on QQP+PAWS\\({}_{\\text{QQP}}\\).\n\nThe auxiliary training set on Wikipedia (PAWS\\({}_{\\text{Wiki-Swap}}\\)) helps further. As Table 9 shows, adding this auxiliary training set is particularly helpful to the performance on PAWS\\({}_{\\text{QQP}}\\), yielding a 12.1% (70.6% vs 58.5%) gain on AUC when training on QQP+PAWS\\({}_{\\text{Wiki}}\\). On PAWS\\({}_{\\text{Wiki}}\\), this addition lifts the (no pre-training) DIIN model AUC from 91.1% (Table 8) to 93.8% (Table 9).\n\nBERT vs DIINBoth models achieve top scores on PAWS, but interestingly, the two models disagree on many pairs and are not correlated in their errors. For example, of 687 of BERT's mistakes on the PAWS\\({}_{\\text{Wiki}}\\) test set, DIIN got 280 (41%) correct. As such, performance might improve with combinations of these two existing models.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the DIIN model used in our experiments has only 590k model parameters, whereas BERT has over 100m. Furthermore, the computational cost of BERT is notably higher than DIIN. Given this, and the fact that DIIN is competitive with BERT (especially when pre-trained on noisy pairs, see Table 8), DIIN is likely the better choice in computationally constrained scenarios--especially those with strict latency requirements.\n\n## 7 Conclusion\n\nDatasets are insufficient for differentiating models if they lack examples that exhibit the necessary diagnostic phenomena. This has led, for example, to new datasets for noun-verb ambiguity Elkahky et al. (2018) and gender bias in coreference Webster et al. (2018); Rudinger et al. (2018); Jieyu Zhao (2018). Our new PAWS datasets join these efforts and provide a new resource for training and evaluating paraphrase identifiers. We show that including PAWS training data for state-of-the-art models dramatically improves their performance on challenging examples and makes them more robust to real world examples. We also demonstrate that PAWS effectively measures sensitivity of models on word order and syntactic structure.\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nWe would like to thank our anonymous reviewers and the Google AI Language team, especially Emily Pitler, for the insightful comments that contributed to this paper.

The number of possible transformations scales exponentially with text length, so data augmentation cannot cover all transformations of an input. This paper considers one exponentially\nlarge family of label-preserving transformations, in which every word in the input can\nbe replaced with a similar word.\nWe train\nthe first models that are provably robust to all\nword substitutions in this family. Our training procedure uses Interval Bound Propagation (IBP) to minimize an upper bound on the\nworst-case loss that any combination of word\nsubstitutions can induce. To evaluate models\u2019\nrobustness to these transformations, we measure accuracy on adversarially chosen word\nsubstitutions applied to test examples.\nOur\nIBP-trained models attain 75% adversarial accuracy on both sentiment analysis on IMDB\nand natural language inference on SNLI. In\ncomparison, on IMDB, models trained normally and ones trained with data augmentation\nachieve adversarial accuracy of only 8% and\n35%, respectively.\n1\nIntroduction\nMachine learning models have achieved impressive accuracy on many NLP tasks, but they are\nsurprisingly brittle. Adding distracting text to the\ninput (Jia and Liang, 2017), paraphrasing the text\n(Iyyer et al., 2018; Ribeiro et al., 2018), replacing\nwords with similar words (Alzantot et al., 2018),\nor inserting character-level \u201ctypos\u201d (Belinkov and\nBisk, 2017; Ebrahimi et al., 2017) can significantly degrade a model\u2019s performance. Such perturbed inputs are called adversarial examples, and\nhave shown to break models in other domains as\nwell, most notably in vision (Szegedy et al., 2014;\n\u2026 made\none\nof\nthe\nmade \naccomplished \ndelivered \none\nof\nthe\nbest \nbetter \nfinest \nnicest  \ngood \nfilms\u2026\nfilms \nmovies \nfilm \ncinema\nx1\nx2\nx3\nx4\nx5\n\u02dcx1\n\u02dcx2\n\u02dcx3\n\u02dcx4\n\u02dcx5\nbest\nx6\n\u02dcx6\nS(x, 1)\nS(x, 2) S(x, 3) S(x, 4)\nS(x, 5)\nS(x, 6)\nInput reviewaaa               \nx\nSubstitution words                 \n\u2026delivered one\nof\nthe\nmovies\u2026\nbetter\nPerturbed reviewaaa               \nPositive\nCNN\nNegative\nCNN\n\u02dcx\nFigure 1: Word substitution-based perturbations in sentiment analysis. For an input x, we consider perturbations \u02dcx, in which every word xi can be replaced with\nany similar word from the set S(x, i), without changing the original sentiment. Models can be easily fooled\nby adversarially chosen perturbations (e.g., changing\n\u201cbest\u201d to \u201cbetter\u201d, \u201cmade\u201d to \u201cdelivered\u201d, \u201cfilms\u201d to\n\u201cmovies\u201d), but the ideal model would be robust to all\ncombinations of word substitutions.\nGoodfellow et al., 2015). Since humans are not\nfooled by the same perturbations, the widespread\nexistence of adversarial examples exposes troubling gaps in models\u2019 understanding.\nIn this paper, we focus on the word substitution\nperturbations of Alzantot et al. (2018). In this setting, an attacker may replace every word in the input with a similar word (that ought not to change\nthe label), leading to an exponentially large number of possible perturbations. Figure 1 shows an\nexample of these word substitutions. As demonstrated by a long line of work in computer vision,\nit is challenging to make models that are robust to\nvery large perturbation spaces, even when the set\nof perturbations is known at training time (Goodfellow et al., 2015; Athalye et al., 2018; Raghunathan et al., 2018; Wong and Kolter, 2018).\nOur paper addresses two key questions. First,\nis it possible to guarantee that a model is robust\nagainst all adversarial perturbations of a given in-\n\f4130\nput? Existing methods that use heuristic search\nto attack models (Ebrahimi et al., 2017; Alzantot\net al., 2018) are slow and cannot provide guarantees of robustness, since the space of possible perturbations is too large to search exhaustively. We\nobtain guarantees by leveraging Interval Bound\nPropagation (IBP), a technique that was previously applied to feedforward networks and CNNs\nin computer vision (Dvijotham et al., 2018). IBP\nefficiently computes a tractable upper bound on\nthe loss of the worst-case perturbation. When this\nupper bound on the worst-case loss is small, the\nmodel is guaranteed to be robust to all perturbations, providing a certificate of robustness.\nTo\napply IBP to NLP settings, we derive new interval bound formulas for multiplication and softmax\nlayers, which enable us to compute IBP bounds for\nLSTMs (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) and\nattention layers (Bahdanau et al., 2015). We also\nextend IBP to handle discrete perturbation sets,\nrather than the continuous ones used in vision.\nSecond, can we train models that are robust in\nthis way? Data augmentation can sometimes mitigate the effect of adversarial examples (Jia and\nLiang, 2017; Belinkov and Bisk, 2017; Ribeiro\net al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019), but it is insufficient when considering very large perturbation\nspaces (Alzantot et al., 2018). Adversarial training strategies from computer vision (Madry et al.,\n2018) rely on gradient information, and therefore\ndo not extend to the discrete perturbations seen in\nNLP. We instead use certifiably robust training, in\nwhich we train models to optimize the IBP upper\nbound (Dvijotham et al., 2018).\nWe evaluate certifiably robust training on two\ntasks\u2014sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset\n(Maas et al., 2011) and natural language inference on the SNLI dataset (Bowman et al.,\n2015). Across various model architectures (bagof-words, CNN, LSTM, and attention-based), certifiably robust training consistently yields models\nwhich are provably robust to all perturbations on a\nlarge fraction of test examples. A normally-trained\nmodel has only 8% and 41% accuracy on IMDB\nand SNLI, respectively, when evaluated on adversarially perturbed test examples. With certifiably\nrobust training, we achieve 75% adversarial accuracy for both IMDB and SNLI. Data augmentation fares much worse than certifiably robust training, with adversarial accuracies falling to 35% and\n71%, respectively.\n2\nSetup\nWe consider tasks where a model must predict a\nlabel y \u2208 Y given textual input x \u2208 X.\nFor\nexample, for sentiment analysis, the input x is a\nsequence of words x1, x2, . . . , xL, and the goal\nis to assign a label y \u2208 {\u22121, 1} denoting negative or positive sentiment, respectively. We use\nz = (x, y) to denote an example with input x and\nlabel y, and use \u03b8 to denote parameters of a model.\nLet f(z, \u03b8) \u2208 R denote some loss of a model with\nparameters \u03b8 on example z. We evaluate models\non f0-1(z, \u03b8), the zero-one loss under model \u03b8.\n2.1\nPerturbations by word substitutions\nOur goal is to build models that are robust to labelpreserving perturbations. In this work, we focus\non perturbations where words of the input are substituted with similar words. Formally, for every\nword xi, we consider a set of allowed substitution\nwords S(x, i), including xi itself. We use \u02dcx to denote a perturbed version of x, where each word\n\u02dcxi is in S(x, i). For an example z = (x, y), let\nBperturb(z) denote the set of all allowed perturbations of z:\nBperturb(z) = {(\u02dcx, y) : \u02dcxi \u2208 S(x, i) \u2200i}.\n(1)\nFigure 1 provides an illustration of word substitution perturbations. We choose S(x, i) so that \u02dcx is\nlikely to be grammatical and have the same label\nas x (see Section 5.1).\n2.2\nRobustness to all perturbations\nLet F(z, \u03b8) denote the set of losses of the network\non the set of perturbed examples defined in (1):\nF(z, \u03b8) = {f(\u02dcz, \u03b8) : \u02dcz \u2208 Bperturb(z)}.\n(2)\nWe define the robust loss as max F(z, \u03b8), the loss\ndue to worst-case perturbation.\nA model is robust at z if it classifies all inputs in the perturbation set correctly, i.e., the robust zero-one loss\nmax F0-1(z, \u03b8) = 0.\nUnfortunately, the robust\nloss is often intractable to compute, as each word\ncan be perturbed independently. For example, reviews in the IMDB dataset (Maas et al., 2011)\nhave a median of 1031 possible perturbations and\nmax of 10271, far too many to enumerate.\nWe\ninstead propose a tractable upper bound by constructing a set O(z, \u03b8) \u2287 F(z, \u03b8). Note that\nmax O0-1(z, \u03b8) = 0 \u21d2 max F0-1(z, \u03b8) = 0\n\u21d4 robust at z.\n(3)\n\f4131\nTherefore, whenever max O0-1(z, \u03b8) = 0, this\nfact is sufficient to certify robustness to all perturbed examples Bperturb(z).\nHowever, since\nO0-1(z, \u03b8) \u2287 F0-1(z, \u03b8), the model could be robust even if max O0-1(z, \u03b8) \u0338= 0.\n3\nCertification via Interval Bound\nPropagation\nWe now show how to use Interval Bound Propagation (IBP) (Dvijotham et al., 2018) to obtain\na superset O(z, \u03b8) of the losses of perturbed inputs F(z, \u03b8), given z, \u03b8, and Bperturb(z). For notational convenience, we drop z and \u03b8. The key\nidea is to compute upper and lower bounds on the\nactivations in each layer of the network, in terms\nof bounds computed for previous layers. These\nbounds propagate through the network, as in a\nstandard forward pass, until we obtain bounds on\nthe final output, i.e., the loss f. While IBP bounds\nmay be loose in general, Section 5.2 shows that\ntraining networks to minimize the upper bound on\nf makes these bounds much tighter (Gowal et al.,\n2018; Raghunathan et al., 2018).\nFormally, let gi denote a scalar-valued function\nof z and \u03b8 (e.g., a single activation in one layer of\nthe network) computed at node i of the computation graph for a given network. Let dep(i) be the\nset of nodes used to compute gi in the computation\ngraph (e.g., activations of the previous layer). Let\nGi denote the set of possible values of gi across all\nexamples in Bperturb(z). We construct an interval\nOi = [\u2113i, ui] that contains all these possible values of gi, i.e., Oi \u2287 Gi. Oi is computed from the\nintervals Odep(i) = {Oj : j \u2208 dep(i)} of the dependencies of gi. Once computed, Oi can then be\nused to compute intervals on nodes that depend on\ni. In this way, bounds propagate through the entire\ncomputation graph in an efficient forward pass.\nWe now discuss how to compute interval\nbounds for NLP models and word substitution perturbations. We obtain interval bounds for model\ninputs given Bperturb(z) (Section 3.1), then show\nhow to compute Oi from Odep(i) for elementary\noperations used in standard NLP models (Section 3.2). Finally, we use these bounds to certify\nrobustness and train robust models.\n3.1\nBounds for the input layer\nPrevious work (Gowal et al., 2018) applied IBP\nto continuous image perturbations, which are\nnaturally represented with interval bounds (Dvi-\nFigure 2: Bounds on the word vector inputs to the neural network. Consider a word (sentence of length one)\nx = a with the set of substitution words S(x, 1) =\n{a, b, c, d, e}. (a) IBP constructs axis-aligned bounds\naround a set of word vectors. These bounds may be\nloose, especially if the word vectors are pre-trained and\nfixed. (b) A different word vector space can give tighter\nIBP bounds, if the convex hull of the word vectors is\nbetter approximated by an axis-aligned box.\njotham et al., 2018). We instead work with discrete word substitutions, which we must convert\ninto interval bounds Oinput in order to use IBP.\nGiven input words x = x1, . . . , xL, we assume\nthat the model embeds each word as ginput =\n[\u03c6(x1), . . . , \u03c6(xL)] \u2208 RL\u00d7d, where \u03c6(xi) \u2208 Rd is\nthe word vector for word xi. To compute Oinput \u2287\nGinput, recall that each input word xi can be replaced with any \u02dcxi \u2208 S(x, i). So, for each coordinate j \u2208 {1, . . . , d}, we can obtain an interval\nbound Oinput\nij\n= [\u2113input\nij\n, uinput\nij\n] for ginput\nij\nby computing the smallest axis-aligned box that contains all\nthe word vectors:\n\u2113input\nij\n=\nmin\nw\u2208S(x,i) \u03c6(w)j, uinput\nij\n=\nmax\nw\u2208S(x,i) \u03c6(w)j.\n(4)\nFigure 2 illustrates these bounds. We can view\nthis as relaxing a set of discrete points to a convex\nset that contains all of the points. Section 4.2 discusses modeling choices to make this box tighter.\n3.2\nInterval bounds for elementary functions\nNext, we describe how to compute the interval of\na node i from intervals of its dependencies. Gowal\net al. (2018) show how to efficiently compute interval bounds for affine transformations (i.e., linear layers) and monotonic elementwise nonlinearities (see Appendix 3). This suffices to compute interval bounds for feedforward networks and\nCNNs.\nHowever, common NLP model components like LSTMs and attention also rely on softmax (for attention), element-wise multiplication\n(for LSTM gates), and dot product (for computing\nattention scores). We show how to compute interval bounds for these new operations. These building blocks can be used to compute interval bounds\n\f4132\nnot only for LSTMs and attention, but also for any\nmodel that uses these elementary functions.\nFor ease of notation, we drop the superscript\ni on gi and write that a node computes a result\nzres = g(zdep) where zres \u2208 R and zdep \u2208 Rm for\nm = |dep(i)|. We are given intervals Odep such\nthat zdep\nj\n\u2208 Odep\nj\n= [\u2113dep\nj , udep\nj ] for each coordinate\nj and want to compute Ores = [\u2113res, ures].\nSoftmax layer.\nThe softmax function is often\nused to convert activations into a probability distribution, e.g., for attention. Gowal et al. (2018)\nuses unnormalized logits and does not handle softmax operations. Formally, let zres represent the\nnormalized score of the word at position c. We\nhave zres =\nexp(zdep\nc )\n\ufffdm\nj=1 exp(zdep\nj\n). The value of zres is\nlargest when zdep\nc\ntakes its largest value and all\nother words take the smallest value:\nures =\nexp(udep\nc )\nexp(udep\nc ) + \ufffd\nj\u0338=c\nexp(\u2113dep\nj )\n.\n(5)\nWe obtain a similar expression for \u2113res. Note that\n\u2113res and ures can each be computed in a forward\npass, with some care taken to avoid numerical instability (see Appendix A.2).\nElement-wise multiplication and dot product.\nModels like LSTMs incorporate gates which perform element-wise multiplication of two activations. Let zres = zdep\n1 zdep\n2\nwhere zres, zdep\n1 , zdep\n2\n\u2208\nR. The extreme values of the product occur at one\nof the four points corresponding to the products of\nthe extreme values of the inputs. In other words,\nC = {\u2113dep\n1 \u2113dep\n2 ,\n\u2113dep\n1 udep\n2\nudep\n1 \u2113dep\n2 ,\nudep\n1 udep\n2 }\n\u2113res = min\n\ufffd\nC\n\ufffd\nures = max\n\ufffd\nC\n\ufffd\n.\n(6)\nPropagating\nintervals\nthrough\nmultiplication\nnodes therefore requires four multiplications.\nDot products between activations are often used\nto compute attention scores.1\nThe dot product\n(zdep\n1 )\u22a4zdep\n2\nis just the sum of the element-wise\nproduct zdep\n1\n\u2299 zdep\n2 . Therefore, we can bound the\ndot product by summing the bounds on each element of zdep\n1\n\u2299zdep\n2 , using the formula for elementwise multiplication.\n1This is distinct from an affine transformation, because\nboth vectors have associated bounds; in an affine layer, the\ninput has bounds, but the weight matrix is fixed.\n3.3\nFinal layer\nClassification models typically output a single\nlogit for binary classification, or k logits for k-way\nclassification. The final loss f(z, \u03b8) is a function\nof the logits s(x). For standard loss functions, we\ncan represent this function in terms of elementwise monotonic functions (Appendix 3) and the\nelementary functions described in Section 3.2.\n1. Zero-one loss: f(z, \u03b8) = I[max(s(x)) = y]\ninvolves a max operation followed by a step\nfunction, which is monotonic.\n2. Cross entropy: For multi-class, f(z, \u03b8) =\nsoftmax(s(x)). In the binary case, f(z, \u03b8) =\n\u03c3(s(x)), where the sigmoid function \u03c3 is\nmonotonic.\nThus,\nwe can compute bounds on the loss\nO(z, \u03b8) = [\u2113final, ufinal] from bounds on the logits.\n3.4\nCertifiably Robust Training with IBP\nFinally, we describe certifiably robust training, in\nwhich we encourage robustness by minimizing the\nupper bound on the worst-case loss (Dvijotham\net al., 2018; Gowal et al., 2018). Recall that for an\nexample z and parameters \u03b8, ufinal(z, \u03b8) is the upper bound on the loss f(z, \u03b8). Given a dataset D,\nwe optimize a weighted combination of the normal\nloss and the upper bound ufinal,\nmin\n\u03b8\n\ufffd\nz\u2208D\n(1 \u2212 \u03ba)f(z, \u03b8) + \u03ba ufinal(z, \u03b8),\n(7)\nwhere 0 \u2264 \u03ba \u2264 1 is a scalar hyperparameter.\nAs described above, we compute ufinal in a modular fashion:\neach layer has an accompanying\nfunction that computes bounds on its outputs given\nbounds on its inputs. Therefore, we can easily apply IBP to new architectures. Bounds propagate\nthrough layers via forward passes, so the entire objective (7) can be optimized via backpropagation.\nGowal et al. (2018) found that this objective was\neasier to optimize by starting with a smaller space\nof allowed perturbations, and make it larger during\ntraining. We accomplish this by artificially shrinking the input layer intervals Oinput\nij\n= [\u2113input\nij\n, uinput\nij\n]\ntowards the original value \u03c6(xi)j by a factor of \u03f5:\n\u2113input\nij\n\u2190 \u03c6(xi)j \u2212 \u03f5(\u03c6(xi)j \u2212 \u2113input\nij\n)\nuinput\nij\n\u2190 \u03c6(xi)j + \u03f5(uinput\nij\n\u2212 \u03c6(xi)j).\nStandard training corresponds to \u03f5 = 0. We train\nfor T init epochs while linearly increasing \u03f5 from 0\n\f4133\nto 1, and also increasing \u03ba from 0 up to a maximum value of \u03ba\u22c6, We then train for an additional\nT final epochs at \u03ba = \u03ba\u22c6 and \u03f5 = 1.\nTo summarize, we use IBP to compute an upper\nbound on the model\u2019s loss when given an adversarially perturbed input. This bound is computed\nin a modular fashion. We efficiently train models\nto minimize this bound via backpropagation.\n4\nTasks and models\nNow we describe the tasks and model architectures on which we run experiments. These models\nare all built from the primitives in Section 3.\n4.1\nTasks\nFollowing Alzantot et al. (2018), we evaluate on\ntwo standard NLP datasets: the IMDB sentiment\nanalysis dataset (Maas et al., 2011) and the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset\n(Bowman et al., 2015). For IMDB, the model is\ngiven a movie review and must classify it as positive or negative. For SNLI, the model is given\ntwo sentences, a premise and a hypothesis, and\nis asked whether the premise entails, contradicts,\nor is neutral with respect to the hypothesis. For\nSNLI, the adversary is only allowed to change the\nhypothesis, as in Alzantot et al. (2018), though it\nis possible to also allow changing the premise.\n4.2\nModels\nIMDB.\nWe\nimplemented\nthree\nmodels\nfor\nIMDB. The bag-of-words model (BOW) averages\nthe word vectors for each word in the input, then\npasses this through a two-layer feedforward network with 100-dimensional hidden state to obtain\na final logit. The other models are similar, except\nthey run either a CNN or bidirectional LSTM on\nthe word vectors, then average their hidden states.\nAll models are trained on cross entropy loss.\nSNLI\nWe implemented two models for SNLI.\nThe bag-of-words model (BOW) encodes the\npremise and hypothesis separately by summing\ntheir word vectors, then feeds the concatenation of\nthese encodings to a 3-layer feedforward network.\nWe also reimplement the Decomposable Attention\nmodel (Parikh et al., 2016), which uses attention\nbetween the premise and hypothesis to compute\nricher representations of each word in both sentences. These context-aware vectors are used in\nthe same way BOW uses the original word vectors to generate the final prediction. Both models\nare trained on cross entropy loss. Implementation\ndetails are provided in Appendix A.4.\nWord vector layer.\nThe choice of word vectors\naffects the tightness of our interval bounds. We\nchoose to define the word vector \u03c6(w) for word w\nas the output of a feedforward layer applied to a\nfixed pre-trained word vector \u03c6pre(w):\n\u03c6(w) = ReLU(gword(\u03c6pre(w))),\n(8)\nwhere gword is a learned linear transformation.\nLearning gword with certifiably robust training encourages it to orient the word vectors so that the\nconvex hull of the word vectors is close to an\naxis-aligned box. Note that gword is applied before bounds are computed via (4).2 Applying gword\nafter the bound calculation would result in looser\ninterval bounds, since the original word vectors\n\u03c6pre(w) might be poorly approximated by interval\nbounds (e.g., Figure 2a), compared to \u03c6(w) (e.g.,\nFigure 2b). Section 5.7 confirms the importance\nof adding gword. We use 300-dimensional GloVe\nvectors (Pennington et al., 2014) as our \u03c6pre(w).\n5\nExperiments\n5.1\nSetup\nWord substitution perturbations.\nWe base our\nsets of allowed word substitutions S(x, i) on the\nsubstitutions allowed by Alzantot et al. (2018).\nThey demonstrated that their substitutions lead to\nadversarial examples that are qualitatively similar\nto the original input and retain the original label,\nas judged by humans. Alzantot et al. (2018) define the neighbors N(w) of a word w as the n = 8\nnearest neighbors of w in a \u201ccounter-fitted\u201d word\nvector space where antonyms are far apart (Mrk\u02c7si\u00b4c\net al., 2016).3 The neighbors must also lie within\nsome Euclidean distance threshold. They also use\na language model constraint to avoid nonsensical perturbations: they allow substituting xi with\n\u02dcxi \u2208 N(xi) if and only if it does not decrease the\nlog-likelihood of the text under a pre-trained language model by more than some threshold.\nWe make three modifications to this approach.\nFirst, in Alzantot et al. (2018), the adversary applies substitutions one at a time, and the neighborhoods and language model scores are computed\n2 Equation (4) must be applied before the model can combine information from multiple words, but it can be delayed\nuntil after processing each word independently.\n3 Note that the model itself classifies using a different\nset of pre-trained word vectors; the counter-fitted vectors are\nonly used to define the set of allowed substitution words.\n\f4134\nrelative to the current altered version of the input.\nThis results in a hard-to-define attack surface, as\nchanging one word can allow or disallow changes\nto other words. It also requires recomputing language model scores at each iteration of the genetic\nattack, which is inefficient. Moreover, the same\nword can be substituted multiple times, leading\nto semantic drift. We define allowed substitutions\nrelative to the original sentence x, and disallow repeated substitutions. Second, we use a faster language model that allows us to query longer contexts; Alzantot et al. (2018) use a slower language\nmodel and could only query it with short contexts.\nFinally, we use the language model constraint only\nat test time; the model is trained against all perturbations in N(w). This encourages the model to be\nrobust to a larger space of perturbations, instead of\nspecializing for the particular choice of language\nmodel. See Appendix A.3 for further details.\nAnalysis of word neighbors.\nOne natural question is whether we could guarantee robustness by\nhaving the model treat all neighboring words the\nsame. We could construct equivalence classes of\nwords from the transitive closure of N(w), and\nrepresent each equivalence class with one embedding. We found that this would lose a significant\namount of information. Out of the 50,000 word\nvocabulary, 19,122 words would be in the same\nequivalence class, including the words \u201cgood\u201d,\n\u201cbad\u201d, \u201cexcellent\u201d, and \u201cterrible.\u201d Of the remaining words, 24,389 (79%) have no neighbors.\nBaseline training methods.\nWe compare certifiably robust training (Section 3) with both standard training and data augmentation, which has\nbeen used in NLP to encourage robustness to\nvarious types of perturbations (Jia and Liang,\n2017; Belinkov and Bisk, 2017; Iyyer et al., 2018;\nRibeiro et al., 2018). In data augmentation, for\neach training example z, we augment the dataset\nwith K new examples \u02dcz by sampling \u02dcz uniformly\nfrom Bperturb(z), then train on the normal cross\nentropy loss. For our main experiments, we use\nK = 4. We do not use adversarial training (Goodfellow et al., 2015) because it would require running an adversarial search procedure at each training step, which would be prohibitively slow.\nEvaluation of robustness.\nWe wish to evaluate\nrobustness of models to all word substitution perturbations. Ideally, we would directly measure robust accuracy, the fraction of test examples z for\nwhich the model is correct on all \u02dcz \u2208 Bperturb(z).\nHowever, evaluating this exactly involves enumerating the exponentially large set of perturbations, which is intractable. Instead, we compute\ntractable upper and lower bounds:\n1. Genetic attack accuracy: Alzantot et al. (2018)\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of a genetic algorithm that searches for perturbations \u02dcz that\ncause model misclassification. The algorithm\nmaintains a \u201cpopulation\u201d of candidate \u02dcz\u2019s and\nrepeatedly perturbs and combines them.\nWe\nused a population size of 60 and ran 40 search\niterations on each example. Since the algorithm\ndoes not exhaustively search over Bperturb(z),\naccuracy on the perturbations it finds is an upper bound on the true robust accuracy.\n2. Certified accuracy: To complement this upper\nbound, we use IBP to obtain a tractable lower\nbound on the robust accuracy. Recall from Section 3.3 that we can use IBP to get an upper\nbound on the zero-one loss.\nFrom this, we\nobtain a lower bound on the robust accuracy\nby measuring the fraction of test examples for\nwhich the zero-one loss is guaranteed to be 0.\nExperimental details.\nFor IMDB, we split\nthe\nofficial\ntrain\nset\ninto\ntrain\nand\ndevelopment subsets, putting reviews for different\nmovies into different splits (matching the original train/test split). For SNLI, we use the official\ntrain/development/test split. We tune hyperparameters on the development set for each dataset. Hyperparameters are reported in Appendix A.4.\n5.2\nMain results\nTable 1 and Table 2 show our main results for\nIMDB and SNLI, respectively. We measure accuracy on perturbations found by the genetic attack (upper bound on robust accuracy) and IBPcertified accuracy (lower bound on robust accuracy) on 1000 random test examples from IMDB,4\nand all 9824 test examples from SNLI. Across\nmany architectures, our models are more robust\nto perturbations than ones trained with data augmentation. This effect is especially pronounced\non IMDB, where inputs can be hundreds of words\nlong, so many words can be perturbed.\nOn\nIMDB, the best IBP-trained model gets 75.0% accuracy on perturbations found by the genetic at-\n4We downsample the test set because the genetic attack is\nslow on IMDB, as inputs can be hundreds of words long.\n\f4135\nSystem\nGenetic attack\n(Upper bound)\nIBP-certified\n(Lower bound)\nStandard training\nBOW\n9.6\n0.8\nCNN\n7.9\n0.1\nLSTM\n6.9\n0.0\nRobust training\nBOW\n70.5\n68.9\nCNN\n75.0\n74.2\nLSTM\n64.7\n63.0\nData augmentation\nBOW\n34.6\n3.5\nCNN\n35.2\n0.3\nLSTM\n33.0\n0.0\nTable 1: Robustness of models on IMDB.

On IMDB, the best model is\nguaranteed to be correct on all perturbations of\n74.2% of test examples, very close to the 75.0%\naccuracy against the genetic attack. In contrast, for\ndata augmentation models, the IBP bound cannot\nguarantee robustness on almost all examples. It\nis possible that a stronger attack (e.g., exhaustive\nsearch) could further lower the accuracy of these\nmodels, or that the IBP bounds are loose.\nLSTM models can be certified with IBP, though\nthey fare worse than other models. IBP bounds\nmay be loose for RNNs because of their long computation paths, along which looseness of bounds\ncan get amplified.

Data\naugmentation cannot achieve high robustness. Certifiably robust training yields much more robust models,\nthough at the cost of some clean accuracy. Lines connect Pareto optimal points for each training strategy.\nwe show on synthetic data that robustly trained\nLSTMs can learn long-range dependencies.\n5.3\nClean versus robust accuracy\nRobust training does cause a moderate drop in\nclean accuracy (accuracy on unperturbed test examples) compared with normal training.\nOn\nIMDB, our normally trained CNN model gets 89%\nclean accuracy, compared to 81% for the robustly\ntrained model. We also see a drop on SNLI: the\nnormally trained BOW model gets 83% clean accuracy, compared to 79% for the robustly trained\nmodel. Similar drops in clean accuracy are also\nseen for robust models in vision (Madry et al.,\n2017).\nFor example, the state-of-the-art robust\nmodel on CIFAR10 (Zhang et al., 2019) only has\n85% clean accuracy, but comparable normallytrained models get > 96% accuracy.\nWe found that the robustly trained models\ntend to underfit the training data\u2014on IMDB, the\nCNN model gets only 86% clean training accuracy, lower than the test accuracy of the normally\ntrained model. The model continued to underfit\nwhen we increased either the depth or width of\nthe network. One possible explanation is that the\nattack surface adds a lot of noise, though a large\nenough model should still be able to overfit the\ntraining set. Better optimization or a tighter way to\ncompute bounds could also improve training accuracy. We leave further exploration to future work.\nNext, we analyzed the trade-off between clean\nand robust accuracy by varying the importance\n\f4136\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\nNumber of words perturbed\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\nFrequency\nRobust training\nData augmentation\nNormal training\nFigure 4: Number of words perturbed by the genetic\nattack to cause errors by CNN models on 1000 IMDB\ndevelopment set examples. Certifiably robust training\nreduces the effect of many simultaneous perturbations.\nplaced on perturbed examples during training.\nWe use accuracy against the genetic attack as\nour proxy for robust accuracy, rather than IBPcertified accuracy, as IBP bounds may be loose\nfor models that were not trained with IBP. For\ndata augmentation, we vary K, the number of augmented examples per real example, from 1 to 64.\nFor certifiably robust training, we vary \u03ba\u22c6, the\nweight of the certified robustness training objective, between 0.01 and 1.0. Figure 3 shows tradeoff curves for the CNN model on 1000 random\nIMDB development set examples. Data augmentation can increase robustness somewhat, but cannot reach very high adversarial accuracy.\nWith\ncertifiably robust training, we can trade off some\nclean accuracy for much higher robust accuracy.\n5.4\nRuntime considerations\nIBP enables efficient computation of ufinal(z, \u03b8),\nbut it still incurs some overhead. Across model\narchitectures, we found that one epoch of certifiably robust training takes between 2\u00d7 and 4\u00d7\nlonger than one epoch of standard training. On\nthe other hand, IBP certificates are much faster to\ncompute at test time than genetic attack accuracy.\nFor the robustly trained CNN IMDB model, computing certificates on 1000 test examples took 5\nseconds, while running the genetic attack on those\nsame examples took over 3 hours.\n5.5\nError analysis\nWe examined development set examples on which\nmodels were correct on the original input but in-\ncorrect on the perturbation found by the genetic\nattack. We refer to such cases as robustness errors.\nWe focused on the CNN IMDB models trained\nnormally, robustly, and with data augmentation.\nWe found that robustness errors of the robustly\ntrained model mostly occurred when it was not\nconfident in its original prediction. The model had\n> 70% confidence in the correct class for the original input in only 14% of robustness errors. In contrast, the normally trained and data augmentation\nmodels were more confident on their robustness\nerrors; they had > 70% confidence on the original\nexample in 92% and 87% of cases, respectively.\nWe next investigated how many words the genetic attack needed to change to cause misclassification, as shown in Figure 4.\nFor the normally trained model, some robustness errors involved only a couple changed words (e.g., \u201cI\u2019ve\nfinally found a movie worse than ...\u201d was classified negative, but the same review with \u201cI\u2019ve finally discovered a movie worse than...\u201d was classified positive), but more changes were also common (e.g., part of a review was changed from \u201cThe\ncreature looked very cheesy\u201d to \u201cThe creature\nseemed supremely dorky\u201d, with 15 words changed\nin total). Surprisingly, certifiably robust training\nnearly eliminated robustness errors in which the\ngenetic attack had to change many words: the genetic attack either caused an error by changing a\ncouple words, or was unable to trigger an error\nat all.\nIn contrast, data augmentation is unable\nto cover the exponentially large space of perturbations that involve many words, so it does not prevent errors caused by changing many words.\n5.6\nTraining schedule\nWe investigated the importance of slowly increasing \u03f5 during training, as suggested by Gowal et al.\n(2018). Fixing \u03f5 = 1 during training led to a 5\npoint reduction in certified accuracy for the CNN.\nOn the other hand, we found that holding \u03ba fixed\ndid not hurt accuracy, and in fact may be preferable. More details are shown in Appendix A.5.\n5.7\nWord vector analysis\nWe determined the importance of the extra feedforward layer gword that we apply to pre-trained\nword vectors, as described in Section 4.2.\nWe\ncompared with directly using pre-trained word\nvectors, i.e. \u03c6(w) = \u03c6pre(w). We also tried using gword but applying interval bounds on \u03c6pre(w),\nthen computing bounds on \u03c6(w) with the IBP for-\n\f4137\nmula for affine layers. In both cases, we could\nnot train a CNN to achieve more than 52.2% certified accuracy on the development set. Thus, transforming pre-trained word vectors and applying interval bounds after is crucial for robust training.\nIn Appendix A.6, we show that robust training\nmakes the intervals around transformed word vectors smaller, compared to the pre-trained vectors.\n6\nRelated Work and Discussion\nRecent work on adversarial examples in NLP has\nproposed various classes of perturbations, such\nas insertion of extraneous text (Jia and Liang,\n2017), word substitutions (Alzantot et al., 2018),\nparaphrasing (Iyyer et al., 2018; Ribeiro et al.,\n2018), and character-level noise (Belinkov and\nBisk, 2017; Ebrahimi et al., 2017). These works\nfocus mainly on demonstrating models\u2019 lack of robustness, and mostly do not explore ways to increase robustness beyond data augmentation. Data\naugmentation is effective for narrow perturbation\nspaces (Jia and Liang, 2017; Ribeiro et al., 2018),\nbut only confers partial robustness in other cases\n(Iyyer et al., 2018; Alzantot et al., 2018). Ebrahimi\net al. (2017) tried adversarial training (Goodfellow\net al., 2015) for character-level perturbations, but\ncould only use a fast heuristic attack at training\ntime, due to runtime considerations. As a result,\ntheir models were still be fooled by running a more\nexpensive search procedure at test time.\nProvable defenses have been studied for simpler NLP models and attacks, particularly for tasks\nlike spam detection where real-life adversaries try\nto evade detection. Globerson and Roweis (2006)\ntrain linear classifiers that are robust to adversarial feature deletion. Dalvi et al. (2004) analyzed\noptimal strategies for a Naive Bayes classifier and\nattacker, but their classifier only defends against a\nfixed attacker that does not adapt to the model.\nRecent work in computer vision (Szegedy et al.,\n2014; Goodfellow et al., 2015) has sparked renewed interest in adversarial examples.\nMost\nwork in this area focuses on L\u221e-bounded perturbations, in which each input pixel can be changed\nby a small amount. The word substitution attack\nmodel we consider is similar to L\u221e perturbations,\nas the adversary can change each input word by\na small amount. Our work is inspired by work\nbased on convex optimization (Raghunathan et al.,\n2018; Wong and Kolter, 2018) and builds directly\non interval bound propagation (Dvijotham et al.,\n2018; Gowal et al., 2018), which has certified robustness of computer vision models to L\u221e attacks.\nAdversarial training via projected gradient descent\n(Madry et al., 2018) has also been shown to improve robustness, but assumes that inputs are continuous. It could be applied in NLP by relaxing\nsets of word vectors to continuous regions.\nThis work provides certificates against word\nsubstitution perturbations for particular models.\nSince IBP is modular, it can be extended to\nother model architectures on other tasks.\nIt is\nan open question whether IBP can give nontrivial bounds for sequence-to-sequence tasks like\nmachine translation (Belinkov and Bisk, 2017;\nMichel et al., 2019). In principle, IBP can handle\ncharacter-level typos (Ebrahimi et al., 2017; Pruthi\net al., 2019), though typos yield more perturbations per word than we consider in this work. We\nare also interested in handling word insertions and\ndeletions, rather than just substitutions. Finally,\nwe would like to train models that get state-ofthe-art clean accuracy while also being provably\nrobust; achieving this remains an open problem.\nIn conclusion, state-of-the-art NLP models are\naccurate on average, but they still have significant\nblind spots. Certifiably robust training provides\na general, principled mechanism to avoid such\nblind spots by encouraging models to make correct predictions on all inputs within some known\nperturbation neighborhood. This type of robustness is a necessary (but not sufficient) property of\nmodels that truly understand language. We hope\nthat our work is a stepping stone towards models\nthat are robust against an even wider, harder-tocharacterize space of possible attacks.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by NSF Award Grant no.\n1805310 and the DARPA ASED program under\nFA8650-18-2-7882.

Suppose zres = a\u22a4zdep + b for weight a \u2208 Rm and\nbias b \u2208 R. zres is largest when positive entries of\na are multiplied with udep and negative with \u2113dep:\nures = 0.5(a + |a|)\u22a4\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\npositive\nudep + 0.5(a \u2212 |a|)\u22a4\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\nnegative\n\u2113dep + b\n= \u00b5 + r,\n(9)\nwhere \u00b5 = 0.5a\u22a4(\u2113dep + udep) + b and r =\n0.5|a|\u22a4(u \u2212 l). A similar computation yields that\n\u2113res = \u00b5 \u2212 r. Therefore, the interval Ores can\nbe computed using two inner product evaluations:\none with a and one with |a|.\nMonotonic scalar functions.\nActivation functions such as ReLU, sigmoid and tanh are monotonic. Suppose zres = \u03c3(zdep) where zres, zdep \u2208\nR, i.e. the node applies an element-wise function\nto its input. The intervals can be computed trivially since zres is minimized at \u2113dep and maximized\nat udep.\n\u2113res = \u03c3(\u2113dep), ures = \u03c3(udep).\n(10)\nA.2\nNumerical stability of softmax\nIn this section, we show how to compute interval\nbounds for softmax layers in a numerically stable\nway. We will do this by showing how to handle\nlog-softmax layers. Note that since softmax is just\nexponentiated log-softmax, and exponentiation is\nmonotonic, bounds on log-softmax directly yield\nbounds on softmax.\nLet zdep denote a vector of length m, let c be\nan integer \u2208 {1, . . . , m}, and let zres represent the\nlog-softmax score of index c, i.e.\nzres = log\nexp(zdep\nc\n)\n\ufffdm\nj=1 exp(zdep\nj\n)\n(11)\n= zdep\nc\n\u2212 log\nm\n\ufffd\nj=1\nexp(zdep\nj\n).\n(12)\nGiven interval bounds \u2113j \u2264 zdep\nj\n\u2264 uj for each j,\nwe show how to compute upper and lower bounds\non zres. For any vector v, we assume access to a\nsubroutine that computes\nlogsumexp(v) = log\n\ufffd\ni\nexp(vi)\nstably.\nThe standard way to compute this\nis to normalize v by subtracting maxi(vi) before taking exponentials, then add it back at\nthe end.\nlogsumexp is a standard function\nin libraries like PyTorch.\nWe will also rely\non the fact that if v\nis the concatenation\nof vectors u and w, then logsumexp(v)\n=\nlogsumexp([logsumexp(u), logsumexp(w)]).\nUpper bound.\nThe upper bound ures is achieved\nby having the maximum value of zdep\nc\n, and minimum value of all others. This can be written as:\nures = udep\nc\n\u2212 log\n\uf8eb\n\uf8edexp(udep\nc ) +\n\ufffd\n1\u2264j\u2264m,j\u0338=c\nexp(\u2113dep\nj )\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 .\n(13)\nWhile we could directly compute this expression,\nit is difficult to vectorize. Instead, with some rearranging, we get\nures = udep\nc\n\u2212 log\n\ufffd\nexp(udep\nc ) \u2212 exp(\u2113dep\nc ) +\nm\n\ufffd\nj=1\nexp(\u2113dep\nj )\n\ufffd\n.\n(14)\nThe second term is the logsumexp of\nlog\n\ufffd\nexp(udep\nc ) \u2212 exp(\u2113dep\nc )\n\ufffd\n(15)\nand\nlogsumexp(\u2113dep).\n(16)\n\f4140\nSince we know how to compute logsumexp, this\nreduces to computing (15). Note that (15) can be\nrewritten as\nudep\nc\n+ log\n\ufffd\n1 \u2212 exp(\u2113dep\nc\n\u2212 udep\nc )\n\ufffd\n(17)\nby adding and subtracting udep\nc . To compute this\nquantity, we consider two cases:\n1. udep\nc\n\u226b \u2113dep\nc . Here we use the fact that stable methods exist to compute log1p(x) =\nlog(1 + x) for x close to 0. We compute the\ndesired value as\nudep\nc\n+ log 1p(\u2212 exp(\u2113dep\nc\n\u2212 udep\nc )),\nsince exp(\u2113dep\nc\n\u2212 udep\nc ) will be close to 0.\n2. udep\nc\nclose to \u2113dep\nc .\nHere we use the\nfact that stable methods exist to compute\nexpm1(x) = exp(x) \u2212 1 for x close to 0.\nWe compute the desired value as\nudep\nc\n+ log(\u2212 expm1(\u2113dep\nc\n\u2212 udep\nc )),\nsince \u2113dep\nc\n\u2212 udep\nc\nmay be close to 0.\nWe use case 1 if udep\nc\n\u2212 \u2113dep\nc\n> log 2, and case 2\notherwise.5\nLower bound.\nThe lower bound \u2113res is achieved\nby having the minimum value of zdep\nc\n, and the\nmaximum value of all others. This can be written\nas:\n\u2113res = \u2113dep\nc\n\u2212 log\n\uf8eb\n\uf8edexp(\u2113dep\nc ) +\n\ufffd\n1\u2264j\u2264m,j\u0338=c\nexp(udep\nj )\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 .\n(18)\nThe second term is just a normal logsumexp,\nwhich is easy to compute. To vectorize the implementation, it helps to first compute the logsumexp\nof everything except \u2113dep\nc , and then logsumexp\nthat with \u2113dep\nc .\nA.3\nAttack surface differences\nIn Alzantot et al. (2018), the adversary applies replacements one at a time, and the neighborhoods\nand language model scores are computed relative\nto the current altered version of the input. This results in a hard-to-define attack surface, as the same\n5See\nhttps://cran.r-project.org/web/\npackages/Rmpfr/vignettes/log1mexp-note.\npdf for further explanation.\nword can be replaced many times, leading to semantic drift. We instead pre-compute the allowed\nsubstitutions S(x, i) at index i based on the original x. We define S(x, i) as the set of \u02dcxi \u2208 N(xi)\nsuch that\nlogP(xi\u2212W:i\u22121, \u02dcxi, xi+1:i+W ) \u2265\nlog P(xi\u2212W:i+W ) \u2212 \u03b4\n(19)\nwhere probabilities are assigned by a pre-trained\nlanguage model, and the window radius W and\nthreshold \u03b4 are hyperparameters. We use W =\n6 and \u03b4\n= 5.\nWe also use a different language model6 from Alzantot et al. (2018) that\nachieves perplexity of 50.79 on the One Billion\nWord dataset (Chelba et al., 2013). Alzantot et al.\n(2018) use a different, slower language model,\nwhich compels them to use a smaller window radius of W = 1.\nA.4\nExperimental details\nWe do not run training for a set number of epochs\nbut do early stopping on the development set instead. For normal training, we early stop on normal development set accuracy. For training with\ndata augmentation, we early stop on the accuracy\non the augmented development set. For certifiably\nrobust training, we early stop on the certifiably robust accuracy on the development set. We use the\nAdam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014) to train\nall models.\nOn IMDB, we restrict the model to only use the\n50, 000 words that are in the vocabulary of the\ncounter-fitted word vector space of Mrk\u02c7si\u00b4c et al.\n(2016). This is because perturbations are not allowed for any words not in this vocabulary, i.e.\nN(w) = {w} for w /\u2208 V . Therefore, the model\nis strongly incentivized to predict based on words\noutside of this set. While this is a valid way to\nachieve high certified accuracy, it is not a valid robustness strategy in general. We simply delete all\nwords that are not in the vocabulary before feeding\nthe input to the model.\nFor SNLI, we use 100-dimensional hidden state\nfor the BOW model and a 3-layer feedforward network. These values were chosen by a hyperparameter search on the dev set. For DECOMPATTN,\nwe use a 300-dimensional hidden state and a 2layer feedforward network on top of the contextaware vectors. These values were chosen to match\nParikh et al.

The number of possible transformations scales exponentially with text length, so data augmentation cannot cover all transformations of an input. This paper considers one exponentially large family of label-preserving transformations, in which every word in the input can be replaced with a similar word. We train the first models that are provably robust to _all_ word substitutions in this family. Our training procedure uses Interval Bound Propagation (IBP) to minimize an upper bound on the worst-case loss that any combination of word substitutions can induce. To evaluate models' robustness to these transformations, we measure accuracy on adversarially chosen word substitutions applied to test examples. Our IBP-trained models attain \\(75\\%\\) adversarial accuracy on both sentiment analysis on IMDB and natural language inference on SNLI. In comparison, on IMDB, models trained normally and ones trained with data augmentation achieve adversarial accuracy of only \\(8\\%\\) and \\(35\\%\\), respectively.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nMachine learning models have achieved impressive accuracy on many NLP tasks, but they are surprisingly brittle. Adding distracting text to the input Jia and Liang (2017), paraphrasing the text Iyyer et al. (2018); Ribeiro et al. (2018), replacing words with similar words Alzantot et al. (2018), or inserting character-level \"typos\" Belinkov and Bisk (2017); Ebrahimi et al. (2017) can significantly degrade a model's performance. Such perturbed inputs are called _adversarial examples_, and have shown to break models in other domains as well, most notably in vision Szegedy et al. (2014); Goodfellow et al. (2015). Since humans are not fooled by the same perturbations, the widespread existence of adversarial examples exposes troubling gaps in models' understanding.\n\nIn this paper, we focus on the word substitution perturbations of Alzantot et al. (2018). In this setting, an attacker may replace every word in the input with a similar word (that ought not to change the label), leading to an exponentially large number of possible perturbations. Figure 1 shows an example of these word substitutions. As demonstrated by a long line of work in computer vision, it is challenging to make models that are robust to very large perturbation spaces, even when the set of perturbations is known at training time Goodfellow et al. (2015); Athalye et al. (2018); Raghunathan et al. (2018); Wong and Kolter (2018).\n\nOur paper addresses two key questions. First, is it possible to guarantee that a model is robust against _all_ adversarial perturbations of a given in\n\nFigure 1: Word substitution-based perturbations in sentiment analysis. For an input \\(x\\), we consider perturbations \\(\\tilde{x}\\), in which _every_ word \\(x_{i}\\) can be replaced with any similar word from the set \\(S(x,i)\\), without changing the original sentiment. Models can be easily fooled by adversarially chosen perturbations (e.g., changing \u201c_best_\u201d to \u201c_better_\u201d, \u201c_made_\u201d to \u201c_delivered_\u201d, \u201c_films_\u201d to \u201c_movies_\u201d), but the ideal model would be robust to all combinations of word substitutions.\n\nput? Existing methods that use heuristic search to attack models (Ebrahimi et al., 2017; Alzantot et al., 2018) are slow and cannot provide guarantees of robustness, since the space of possible perturbations is too large to search exhaustively. We obtain guarantees by leveraging Interval Bound Propagation (IBP), a technique that was previously applied to feedforward networks and CNNs in computer vision (Dvijotham et al., 2018). IBP efficiently computes a tractable _upper bound_ on the loss of the worst-case perturbation. When this upper bound on the worst-case loss is small, the model is guaranteed to be robust to all perturbations, providing a _certificate_ of robustness. To apply IBP to NLP settings, we derive new interval bound formulas for multiplication and softmax layers, which enable us to compute IBP bounds for LSTMs (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) and attention layers (Bahdanau et al., 2015). We also extend IBP to handle discrete perturbation sets, rather than the continuous ones used in vision.\n\nSecond, can we train models that are robust in this way? Data augmentation can sometimes mitigate the effect of adversarial examples (Jia and Liang, 2017; Belinkov and Bisk, 2017; Ribeiro et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019), but it is insufficient when considering very large perturbation spaces (Alzantot et al., 2018). Adversarial training strategies from computer vision (Madry et al., 2018) rely on gradient information, and therefore do not extend to the discrete perturbations seen in NLP. We instead use _certifiably robust training_, in which we train models to optimize the IBP upper bound (Dvijotham et al., 2018).\n\nWe evaluate certifiably robust training on two tasks--sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset (Maas et al., 2011) and natural language inference on the SNLI dataset (Bowman et al., 2015). Across various model architectures (bag-of-words, CNN, LSTM, and attention-based), certifiably robust training consistently yields models which are provably robust to all perturbations on a large fraction of test examples. A normally-trained model has only \\(8\\%\\) and \\(41\\%\\) accuracy on IMDB and SNLI, respectively, when evaluated on adversarially perturbed test examples. With certifiably robust training, we achieve \\(75\\%\\) adversarial accuracy for both IMDB and SNLI. Data augmentation fares much worse than certifiably robust training, with adversarial accuracies falling to \\(35\\%\\) and \\(71\\%\\), respectively.\n\n## 2 Setup\n\nWe consider tasks where a model must predict a label \\(y\\in\\mathcal{Y}\\) given textual input \\(x\\in\\mathcal{X}\\). For example, for sentiment analysis, the input \\(x\\) is a sequence of words \\(x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,x_{L}\\), and the goal is to assign a label \\(y\\in\\{-1,1\\}\\) denoting negative or positive sentiment, respectively. We use \\(z=(x,y)\\) to denote an example with input \\(x\\) and label \\(y\\), and use \\(\\theta\\) to denote parameters of a model. Let \\(f(z,\\theta)\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) denote some loss of a model with parameters \\(\\theta\\) on example \\(z\\). We evaluate models on \\(f^{\\text{0-1}}(z,\\theta)\\), the zero-one loss under model \\(\\theta\\).\n\n### Perturbations by word substitutions\n\nOur goal is to build models that are robust to label-preserving perturbations. In this work, we focus on perturbations where words of the input are substituted with similar words. Formally, for every word \\(x_{i}\\), we consider a set of allowed substitution words \\(S(x,i)\\), including \\(x_{i}\\) itself. We use \\(\\tilde{x}\\) to denote a perturbed version of \\(x\\), where each word \\(\\tilde{x}_{i}\\) is in \\(S(x,i)\\). For an example \\(z=(x,y)\\), let \\(B_{\\text{perturb}}(z)\\) denote the set of _all_ allowed perturbations of \\(z\\):\n\n\\[B_{\\text{perturb}}(z)=\\{(\\tilde{x},y):\\tilde{x}_{i}\\in S(x,i)\\;\\;\\forall i\\}. \\tag{1}\\]\n\nFigure 1 provides an illustration of word substitution perturbations. We choose \\(S(x,i)\\) so that \\(\\tilde{x}\\) is likely to be grammatical and have the same label as \\(x\\) (see Section 5.1).\n\n### Robustness to all perturbations\n\nLet \\(\\mathcal{F}(z,\\theta)\\) denote the set of losses of the network on the set of perturbed examples defined in (1):\n\n\\[\\mathcal{F}(z,\\theta)=\\{f(\\tilde{z},\\theta):\\tilde{z}\\in B_{\\text{perturb}}( z)\\}. \\tag{2}\\]\n\nWe define the _robust loss_ as \\(\\max\\mathcal{F}(z,\\theta)\\), the loss due to worst-case perturbation. A model is robust at \\(z\\) if it classifies all inputs in the perturbation set correctly, i.e., the robust zero-one loss \\(\\max\\mathcal{F}^{\\text{0-1}}(z,\\theta)=0\\). Unfortunately, the robust loss is often intractable to compute, as each word can be perturbed independently. For example, reviews in the IMDB dataset (Maas et al., 2011) have a median of \\(10^{31}\\) possible perturbations and max of \\(10^{271}\\), far too many to enumerate. We instead propose a tractable _upper bound_ by constructing a set \\(\\mathcal{O}(z,\\theta)\\supseteq\\mathcal{F}(z,\\theta)\\). Note that\n\n\\[\\max\\mathcal{O}^{\\text{0-1}}(z,\\theta)=0 \\Rightarrow\\max\\mathcal{F}^{\\text{0-1}}(z,\\theta)=0\\] \\[\\Leftrightarrow\\text{robust at }z. \\tag{3}\\]Therefore, whenever \\(\\max\\mathcal{O}^{\\text{\\text{\\text{\\textminus}1}}}(z,\\theta)=0\\), this fact is sufficient to _certify_ robustness to all perturbed examples \\(B_{\\text{perturb}}(z)\\). However, since \\(\\mathcal{O}^{\\text{\\text{\\textminus}1}}(z,\\theta)\\supseteq\\mathcal{F}^{\\text{ \\text{\\textminus}1}}(z,\\theta)\\), the model could be robust even if \\(\\max\\mathcal{O}^{\\text{\\text{\\textminus}1}}(z,\\theta)\\neq 0\\).\n\n## 3 Certification via Interval Bound Propagation\n\nWe now show how to use Interval Bound Propagation (IBP) (Dvijotham et al., 2018) to obtain a superset \\(\\mathcal{O}(z,\\theta)\\) of the losses of perturbed inputs \\(\\mathcal{F}(z,\\theta)\\), given \\(z\\), \\(\\theta\\), and \\(B_{\\text{perturb}}(z)\\). For notational convenience, we drop \\(z\\) and \\(\\theta\\). The key idea is to compute upper and lower bounds on the activations in each layer of the network, in terms of bounds computed for previous layers. These bounds _propagate_ through the network, as in a standard forward pass, until we obtain bounds on the final output, i.e., the loss \\(f\\). While IBP bounds may be loose in general, Section 5.2 shows that training networks to minimize the upper bound on \\(f\\) makes these bounds much tighter (Gowal et al., 2018; Raghunathan et al., 2018).\n\nFormally, let \\(g^{i}\\) denote a scalar-valued function of \\(z\\) and \\(\\theta\\) (e.g., a single activation in one layer of the network) computed at node \\(i\\) of the computation graph for a given network. Let \\(\\mathrm{dep}(i)\\) be the set of nodes used to compute \\(g^{i}\\) in the computation graph (e.g., activations of the previous layer). Let \\(\\mathcal{G}^{i}\\) denote the set of possible values of \\(g^{i}\\) across all examples in \\(B_{\\text{perturb}}(z)\\). We construct an interval \\(\\mathcal{O}^{i}=[\\ell^{i},u^{i}]\\) that contains all these possible values of \\(g^{i}\\), i.e., \\(\\mathcal{O}^{i}\\supseteq\\mathcal{G}^{i}\\). \\(\\mathcal{O}^{i}\\) is computed from the intervals \\(\\mathcal{O}^{\\mathrm{dep}(i)}=\\{\\mathcal{O}^{j}:j\\in\\mathrm{dep}(i)\\}\\) of the dependencies of \\(g^{i}\\). Once computed, \\(\\mathcal{O}^{i}\\) can then be used to compute intervals on nodes that depend on \\(i\\). In this way, bounds propagate through the entire computation graph in an efficient forward pass.\n\nWe now discuss how to compute interval bounds for NLP models and word substitution perturbations. We obtain interval bounds for model inputs given \\(B_{\\text{perturb}}(z)\\) (Section 3.1), then show how to compute \\(\\mathcal{O}^{i}\\) from \\(\\mathcal{O}^{\\text{dep(i)}}\\) for elementary operations used in standard NLP models (Section 3.2). Finally, we use these bounds to certify robustness and train robust models.\n\n### Bounds for the input layer\n\nPrevious work (Gowal et al., 2018) applied IBP to continuous image perturbations, which are naturally represented with interval bounds (Dvijotham et al., 2018). We instead work with discrete word substitutions, which we must convert into interval bounds \\(\\mathcal{O}^{\\text{input}}\\) in order to use IBP. Given input words \\(x=x_{1},\\dots,x_{L}\\), we assume that the model embeds each word as \\(g^{\\text{input}}=[\\phi(x_{1}),\\dots,\\phi(x_{L})]\\in\\mathbb{R}^{L\\times d}\\), where \\(\\phi(x_{i})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\) is the word vector for word \\(x_{i}\\). To compute \\(\\mathcal{O}^{\\text{input}}\\supseteq\\mathcal{G}^{\\text{input}}\\), recall that each input word \\(x_{i}\\) can be replaced with any \\(\\tilde{x}_{i}\\in S(x,i)\\). So, for each coordinate \\(j\\in\\{1,\\dots,d\\}\\), we can obtain an interval bound \\(\\mathcal{O}^{\\text{input}}_{ij}=[\\ell^{\\text{input}}_{ij},u^{\\text{input}}_{ ij}]\\) for \\(g^{\\text{input}}_{ij}\\) by computing the smallest axis-aligned box that contains all the word vectors:\n\n\\[\\ell^{\\text{input}}_{ij}=\\min_{w\\in S(x,i)}\\phi(w)_{j},\\;\\;u^{\\text{input}}_{ ij}\\;\\;=\\max_{w\\in S(x,i)}\\phi(w)_{j}. \\tag{4}\\]\n\nFigure 2 illustrates these bounds. We can view this as relaxing a set of discrete points to a convex set that contains all of the points. Section 4.2 discusses modeling choices to make this box tighter.\n\n### Interval bounds for elementary functions\n\nNext, we describe how to compute the interval of a node \\(i\\) from intervals of its dependencies. Gowal et al. (2018) show how to efficiently compute interval bounds for affine transformations (i.e., linear layers) and monotonic elementwise nonlinearities (see Appendix 3). This suffices to compute interval bounds for feedforward networks and CNNs. However, common NLP model components like LSTMs and attention also rely on softmax (for attention), element-wise multiplication (for LSTM gates), and dot product (for computing attention scores). We show how to compute interval bounds for these new operations. These building blocks can be used to compute interval bounds\n\nFigure 2: Bounds on the word vector inputs to the neural network. Consider a word (sentence of length one) \\(x=a\\) with the set of substitution words \\(S(x,1)=\\{a,b,c,d,e\\}\\). (a) IBP constructs axis-aligned bounds around a set of word vectors. These bounds may be loose, especially if the word vectors are pre-trained and fixed. (b) A different word vector space can give tighter IBP bounds, if the convex hull of the word vectors is better approximated by an axis-aligned box.\n\nnot only for LSTMs and attention, but also for any model that uses these elementary functions.\n\nFor ease of notation, we drop the superscript \\(i\\) on \\(g^{i}\\) and write that a node computes a result \\(z^{\\text{res}}=g(z^{\\text{dep}})\\) where \\(z^{\\text{res}}\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(z^{\\text{dep}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) for \\(m=|\\text{dep}(i)|\\). We are given intervals \\(\\mathcal{O}^{\\text{dep}}\\) such that \\(z^{\\text{dep}}_{j}\\in\\mathcal{O}^{\\text{dep}}_{j}=[\\ell^{\\text{dep}}_{j},u^{ \\text{dep}}_{j}]\\) for each coordinate \\(j\\) and want to compute \\(\\mathcal{O}^{\\text{res}}=[\\ell^{\\text{res}},u^{\\text{res}}]\\).\n\nSoftmax layer.The softmax function is often used to convert activations into a probability distribution, e.g., for attention. Gowal et al. (2018) uses unnormalized logits and does not handle softmax operations. Formally, let \\(z^{\\text{res}}\\) represent the normalized score of the word at position \\(c\\). We have \\(z^{\\text{res}}=\\frac{\\exp(\\frac{\\text{dep}}{c})}{\\sum_{j=1}^{m}\\exp(\\frac{ \\text{dep}}{j})}\\). The value of \\(z^{\\text{res}}\\) is largest when \\(z^{\\text{dep}}_{c}\\) takes its largest value and all other words take the smallest value:\n\n\\[u^{\\text{res}}=\\frac{\\exp(u^{\\text{dep}}_{c})}{\\exp(u^{\\text{dep}}_{c})+\\sum \\limits_{j\\neq c}\\exp(\\ell^{\\text{dep}}_{j})}. \\tag{5}\\]\n\nWe obtain a similar expression for \\(\\ell^{\\text{res}}\\). Note that \\(\\ell^{\\text{res}}\\) and \\(u^{\\text{res}}\\) can each be computed in a forward pass, with some care taken to avoid numerical instability (see Appendix A.2).\n\nElement-wise multiplication and dot product.Models like LSTMs incorporate gates which perform element-wise multiplication of two activations. Let \\(z^{\\text{res}}=z^{\\text{dep}}_{1}z^{\\text{dep}}_{2}\\) where \\(z^{\\text{res}},z^{\\text{dep}}_{1},z^{\\text{dep}}_{2}\\in\\mathbb{R}\\). The extreme values of the product occur at one of the four points corresponding to the products of the extreme values of the inputs. In other words,\n\n\\[\\mathcal{C}=\\{\\ell^{\\text{dep}}_{1}\\ell^{\\text{dep}}_{2},\\;\\;\\; \\ell^{\\text{dep}}_{1}u^{\\text{dep}}_{2}\\] \\[u^{\\text{dep}}_{1}\\ell^{\\text{dep}}_{2},\\;\\;\\;u^{\\text{dep}}_{1 }u^{\\text{dep}}_{2}\\}\\] \\[\\ell^{\\text{res}}=\\min\\big{(}\\mathcal{C}\\big{)}\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;u^{ \\text{res}}=\\max\\big{(}\\mathcal{C}\\big{)}. \\tag{6}\\]\n\nPropagating intervals through multiplication nodes therefore requires four multiplications.\n\nDot products between activations are often used to compute attention scores.1 The dot product \\((z^{\\text{dep}}_{1})^{\\top}z^{\\text{dep}}_{2}\\) is just the sum of the element-wise product \\(z^{\\text{dep}}_{1}\\odot z^{\\text{dep}}_{2}\\). Therefore, we can bound the dot product by summing the bounds on each element of \\(z^{\\text{dep}}_{1}\\odot z^{\\text{dep}}_{2}\\), using the formula for element-wise multiplication.\n\nFootnote 1: This is distinct from an affine transformation, because both vectors have associated bounds; in an affine layer, the input has bounds, but the weight matrix is fixed.\n\n### Final layer\n\nClassification models typically output a single logit for binary classification, or \\(k\\) logits for \\(k\\)-way classification. The final loss \\(f(z,\\theta)\\) is a function of the logits \\(s(x)\\). For standard loss functions, we can represent this function in terms of element-wise monotonic functions (Appendix 3) and the elementary functions described in Section 3.2.\n\n1. Zero-one loss: \\(f(z,\\theta)=\\mathbb{I}[\\max(s(x))=y]\\) involves a max operation followed by a step function, which is monotonic.\n2. Cross entropy: For multi-class, \\(f(z,\\theta)=\\text{softmax}(s(x))\\). In the binary case, \\(f(z,\\theta)=\\sigma(s(x))\\), where the sigmoid function \\(\\sigma\\) is monotonic.\n\nThus, we can compute bounds on the loss \\(\\mathcal{O}(z,\\theta)=[\\ell^{\\text{final}},u^{\\text{final}}]\\) from bounds on the logits.\n\n### Certifiably Robust Training with IBP\n\nFinally, we describe certifiably robust training, in which we encourage robustness by minimizing the upper bound on the worst-case loss (Dvijotham et al., 2018; Gowal et al., 2018). Recall that for an example \\(z\\) and parameters \\(\\theta\\), \\(u^{\\text{final}}(z,\\theta)\\) is the upper bound on the loss \\(f(z,\\theta)\\). Given a dataset \\(D\\), we optimize a weighted combination of the normal loss and the upper bound \\(u^{\\text{final}}\\),\n\n\\[\\min_{\\theta}\\sum_{z\\in D}(1-\\kappa)f(z,\\theta)+\\kappa\\,u^{\\text{final}}(z, \\theta), \\tag{7}\\]\n\nwhere \\(0\\leq\\kappa\\leq 1\\) is a scalar hyperparameter.\n\nAs described above, we compute \\(u^{\\text{final}}\\) in a modular fashion: each layer has an accompanying function that computes bounds on its outputs given bounds on its inputs. Therefore, we can easily apply IBP to new architectures. Bounds propagate through layers via forward passes, so the entire objective (7) can be optimized via backpropagation.\n\nGowal et al. (2018) found that this objective was easier to optimize by starting with a smaller space of allowed perturbations, and make it larger during training. We accomplish this by artificially shrinking the input layer intervals \\(\\mathcal{O}^{\\text{input}}_{ij}=[\\ell^{\\text{input}}_{ij},u^{\\text{input}}_{ ij}]\\) towards the original value \\(\\phi(x_{i})_{j}\\) by a factor of \\(\\epsilon\\):\n\n\\[\\ell^{\\text{input}}_{ij} \\leftarrow\\phi(x_{i})_{j}-\\epsilon(\\phi(x_{i})_{j}-\\ell^{\\text{input }}_{ij})\\] \\[u^{\\text{input}}_{ij} \\leftarrow\\phi(x_{i})_{j}+\\epsilon(u^{\\text{input}}_{ij}-\\phi(x_{i })_{j}).\\]\n\nStandard training corresponds to \\(\\epsilon=0\\). We train for \\(T^{\\text{init}}\\) epochs while linearly increasing \\(\\epsilon\\) from \\(0\\)to \\(1\\), and also increasing \\(\\kappa\\) from \\(0\\) up to a maximum value of \\(\\kappa^{\\star}\\), We then train for an additional \\(T^{\\text{final}}\\) epochs at \\(\\kappa=\\kappa^{\\star}\\) and \\(\\epsilon=1\\).\n\nTo summarize, we use IBP to compute an upper bound on the model's loss when given an adversarially perturbed input. This bound is computed in a modular fashion. We efficiently train models to minimize this bound via backpropagation.\n\n## 4 Tasks and models\n\nNow we describe the tasks and model architectures on which we run experiments. These models are all built from the primitives in Section 3.\n\n### Tasks\n\nFollowing Alzantot et al. (2018), we evaluate on two standard NLP datasets: the IMDB sentiment analysis dataset (Maas et al., 2011) and the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset (Bowman et al., 2015). For IMDB, the model is given a movie review and must classify it as positive or negative. For SNLI, the model is given two sentences, a premise and a hypothesis, and is asked whether the premise entails, contradicts, or is neutral with respect to the hypothesis. For SNLI, the adversary is only allowed to change the hypothesis, as in Alzantot et al. (2018), though it is possible to also allow changing the premise.\n\n### Models\n\nIMDB.We implemented three models for IMDB. The bag-of-words model (BoW) averages the word vectors for each word in the input, then passes this through a two-layer feedforward network with \\(100\\)-dimensional hidden state to obtain a final logit. The other models are similar, except they run either a CNN or bidirectional LSTM on the word vectors, then average their hidden states. All models are trained on cross entropy loss.\n\nSnliWe implemented two models for SNLI. The bag-of-words model (BoW) encodes the premise and hypothesis separately by summing their word vectors, then feeds the concatenation of these encodings to a 3-layer feedforward network. We also reimplement the Decomposable Attention model (Parikh et al., 2016), which uses attention between the premise and hypothesis to compute richer representations of each word in both sentences. These context-aware vectors are used in the same way BoW uses the original word vectors to generate the final prediction. Both models are trained on cross entropy loss. Implementation details are provided in Appendix A.4.\n\nWord vector layer.The choice of word vectors affects the tightness of our interval bounds. We choose to define the word vector \\(\\phi(w)\\) for word \\(w\\) as the output of a feedforward layer applied to a fixed pre-trained word vector \\(\\phi^{\\text{pre}}(w)\\):\n\n\\[\\phi(w)=\\operatorname{ReLU}(g^{\\text{word}}(\\phi^{\\text{pre}}(w))), \\tag{8}\\]\n\nwhere \\(g^{\\text{word}}\\) is a learned linear transformation. Learning \\(g^{\\text{word}}\\) with certifiably robust training encourages it to orient the word vectors so that the convex hull of the word vectors is close to an axis-aligned box. Note that \\(g^{\\text{word}}\\) is applied _before_ bounds are computed via (4).2 Applying \\(g^{\\text{word}}\\) after the bound calculation would result in looser interval bounds, since the original word vectors \\(\\phi^{\\text{pre}}(w)\\) might be poorly approximated by interval bounds (e.g., Figure 1(a)), compared to \\(\\phi(w)\\) (e.g., Figure 1(b)). Section 5.7 confirms the importance of adding \\(g^{\\text{word}}\\). We use \\(300\\)-dimensional GloVe vectors (Pennington et al., 2014) as our \\(\\phi^{\\text{pre}}(w)\\).\n\nFootnote 2: Equation (4) must be applied before the model can combine information from multiple words, but it can be delayed until after processing each word independently.\n\n## 5 Experiments\n\n### Setup\n\nWord substitution perturbations.We base our sets of allowed word substitutions \\(S(x,i)\\) on the substitutions allowed by Alzantot et al. (2018). They demonstrated that their substitutions lead to adversarial examples that are qualitatively similar to the original input and retain the original label, as judged by humans. Alzantot et al. (2018) define the neighbors \\(N(w)\\) of a word \\(w\\) as the \\(n=8\\) nearest neighbors of \\(w\\) in a \"counter-fitted\" word vector space where antonyms are far apart (Mrksic et al., 2016).3 The neighbors must also lie within some Euclidean distance threshold. They also use a language model constraint to avoid nonsensical perturbations: they allow substituting \\(x_{i}\\) with \\(\\hat{x}_{i}\\in N(x_{i})\\) if and only if it does not decrease the log-likelihood of the text under a pre-trained language model by more than some threshold.\n\nFootnote 3: Note that the model itself classifies using a different set of pre-trained word vectors; the counter-fitted vectors are only used to define the set of allowed substitution words.\n\nWe make three modifications to this approach. First, in Alzantot et al. (2018), the adversary applies substitutions one at a time, and the neighborhoods and language model scores are computedrelative to the current altered version of the input. This results in a hard-to-define attack surface, as changing one word can allow or disallow changes to other words. It also requires recomputing language model scores at each iteration of the genetic attack, which is inefficient. Moreover, the same word can be substituted multiple times, leading to semantic drift. We define allowed substitutions relative to the original sentence \\(x\\), and disallow repeated substitutions. Second, we use a faster language model that allows us to query longer contexts; Alzantot et al. (2018) use a slower language model and could only query it with short contexts. Finally, we use the language model constraint only at test time; the model is trained against all perturbations in \\(N(w)\\). This encourages the model to be robust to a larger space of perturbations, instead of specializing for the particular choice of language model. See Appendix A.3 for further details.\n\nAnalysis of word neighbors.One natural question is whether we could guarantee robustness by having the model treat all neighboring words the same. We could construct equivalence classes of words from the transitive closure of \\(N(w)\\), and represent each equivalence class with one embedding. We found that this would lose a significant amount of information. Out of the 50,000 word vocabulary, 19,122 words would be in the same equivalence class, including the words \"good\", \"bad\", \"excellent\", and \"terrible.\" Of the remaining words, 24,389 (\\(79\\%\\)) have no neighbors.\n\nBaseline training methods.We compare certifiably robust training (Section 3) with both standard training and data augmentation, which has been used in NLP to encourage robustness to various types of perturbations Jia and Liang (2017); Belinkov and Bisk (2017); Iyyer et al. (2018); Ribeiro et al. (2018). In data augmentation, for each training example \\(z\\), we augment the dataset with \\(K\\) new examples \\(\\tilde{z}\\) by sampling \\(\\tilde{z}\\) uniformly from \\(B_{\\text{perturb}}(z)\\), then train on the normal cross entropy loss. For our main experiments, we use \\(K=4\\). We do not use adversarial training Goodfellow et al. (2015) because it would require running an adversarial search procedure at each training step, which would be prohibitively slow.\n\nEvaluation of robustness.We wish to evaluate robustness of models to all word substitution perturbations. Ideally, we would directly measure _robust accuracy_, the fraction of test examples \\(z\\) for which the model is correct on all \\(\\tilde{z}\\in B_{\\text{perturb}}(z)\\). However, evaluating this exactly involves enumerating the exponentially large set of perturbations, which is intractable. Instead, we compute tractable upper and lower bounds:\n\n1. Genetic attack accuracy: Alzantot et al. (2018) demonstrate the effectiveness of a genetic algorithm that searches for perturbations \\(\\tilde{z}\\) that cause model misclassification. The algorithm maintains a \"population\" of candidate \\(\\tilde{z}\\)'s and repeatedly perturbs and combines them. We used a population size of \\(60\\) and ran \\(40\\) search iterations on each example. Since the algorithm does not exhaustively search over \\(B_{\\text{perturb}}(z)\\), accuracy on the perturbations it finds is an _upper bound_ on the true robust accuracy.\n2. Certified accuracy: To complement this upper bound, we use IBP to obtain a tractable lower bound on the robust accuracy. Recall from Section 3.3 that we can use IBP to get an upper bound on the zero-one loss. From this, we obtain a _lower bound_ on the robust accuracy by measuring the fraction of test examples for which the zero-one loss is guaranteed to be \\(0\\).\n\nExperimental details.For IMDB, we split the official train set into train and development subsets, putting reviews for different movies into different splits (matching the original train/test split). For SNLI, we use the official train/development/test split. We tune hyperparameters on the development set for each dataset. Hyperparameters are reported in Appendix A.4.\n\n### Main results\n\nTable 1 and Table 2 show our main results for IMDB and SNLI, respectively. We measure accuracy on perturbations found by the genetic attack (upper bound on robust accuracy) and IBP-certified accuracy (lower bound on robust accuracy) on \\(1000\\) random test examples from IMDB,4 and all \\(9824\\) test examples from SNLI. Across many architectures, our models are more robust to perturbations than ones trained with data augmentation. This effect is especially pronounced on IMDB, where inputs can be hundreds of words long, so many words can be perturbed. On IMDB, the best IBP-trained model gets \\(75.0\\%\\) accuracy on perturbations found by the genetic at\n\ntack, whereas the best data augmentation model gets \\(35.2\\%\\). Normally trained models are even worse, with adversarial accuracies below \\(10\\%\\).\n\nCertified accuracyCertifiably robust training yields models with tight guarantees on robustness--the upper and lower bounds on robust accuracy are close. On IMDB, the best model is _guaranteed_ to be correct on all perturbations of \\(74.2\\%\\) of test examples, very close to the \\(75.0\\%\\) accuracy against the genetic attack. In contrast, for data augmentation models, the IBP bound cannot guarantee robustness on almost all examples. It is possible that a stronger attack (e.g., exhaustive search) could further lower the accuracy of these models, or that the IBP bounds are loose.\n\nLSTM models can be certified with IBP, though they fare worse than other models. IBP bounds may be loose for RNNs because of their long computation paths, along which looseness of bounds can get amplified. Nonetheless, in Appendix A.7, we show on synthetic data that robustly trained LSTMs can learn long-range dependencies.\n\n### Clean versus robust accuracy\n\nRobust training does cause a moderate drop in clean accuracy (accuracy on unperturbed test examples) compared with normal training. On IMDB, our normally trained CNN model gets \\(89\\%\\) clean accuracy, compared to \\(81\\%\\) for the robustly trained model. We also see a drop on SNLI: the normally trained BoW model gets \\(83\\%\\) clean accuracy, compared to \\(79\\%\\) for the robustly trained model. Similar drops in clean accuracy are also seen for robust models in vision (Madry et al., 2017). For example, the state-of-the-art robust model on CIFAR10 (Zhang et al., 2019) only has \\(85\\%\\) clean accuracy, but comparable normally-trained models get \\(>96\\%\\) accuracy.\n\nWe found that the robustly trained models tend to underfit the training data--on IMDB, the CNN model gets only \\(86\\%\\) clean training accuracy, lower than the _test_ accuracy of the normally trained model. The model continued to underfit when we increased either the depth or width of the network. One possible explanation is that the attack surface adds a lot of noise, though a large enough model should still be able to overfit the training set. Better optimization or a tighter way to compute bounds could also improve training accuracy. We leave further exploration to future work.\n\nNext, we analyzed the trade-off between clean and robust accuracy by varying the importance\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l|c|c|} \\hline \\multirow{2}{*}{System} & Genetic attack & IBP-certified \\\\  & (Upper bound) & (Lower bound) \\\\ \\hline\n**Standard training** & & \\\\ BoW & \\(9.6\\) & \\(0.8\\) \\\\ CNN & \\(7.9\\) & \\(0.1\\) \\\\ LSTM & \\(6.9\\) & \\(0.0\\) \\\\ \\hline\n**Robust training** & & \\\\ BoW & \\(70.5\\) & \\(68.9\\) \\\\ CNN & \\(\\mathbf{75.0}\\) & \\(\\mathbf{74.2}\\) \\\\ LSTM & \\(64.7\\) & \\(63.0\\) \\\\ \\hline\n**Data augmentation** & & \\\\ BoW & \\(34.6\\) & \\(3.5\\) \\\\ CNN & \\(35.2\\) & \\(0.3\\) \\\\ LSTM & \\(33.0\\) & \\(0.0\\) \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: Robustness of models on IMDB. We report accuracy on perturbations obtained via the genetic attack (upper bound on robust accuracy), and certified accuracy obtained using IBP (lower bound on robust accuracy) on \\(1000\\) random IMDB test set examples. For all models, robust training vastly outperforms data augmentation (\\(p<10^{-63}\\), Wilcoxon signed-rank test).\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l|c|c|} \\hline \\multirow{2}{*}{System} & Genetic attack & IBP-certified \\\\  & (Upper bound) & (Lower bound) \\\\ \\hline\n**Normal training** & & \\\\ BoW & \\(40.5\\) & \\(2.3\\) \\\\ Decompattn & \\(40.3\\) & \\(1.4\\) \\\\ \\hline\n**Robust training** & & \\\\ BoW & \\(\\mathbf{75.0}\\) & \\(\\mathbf{72.7}\\) \\\\ Decompattn & \\(73.7\\) & \\(72.4\\) \\\\ \\hline\n**Data augmentation** & & \\\\ BoW & \\(68.5\\) & \\(7.7\\) \\\\ Decompattn & \\(70.8\\) & \\(1.4\\) \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 2: Robustness of models on the SNLI test set. For both models, robust training outperforms data augmentation (\\(p<10^{-10}\\), Wilcoxon signed-rank test).\n\nFigure 3: Trade-off between clean accuracy and genetic attack accuracy for CNN models on IMDB. Data augmentation cannot achieve high robustness. Certifiably robust training yields much more robust models, though at the cost of some clean accuracy. Lines connect Pareto optimal points for each training strategy.\n\nplaced on perturbed examples during training. We use accuracy against the genetic attack as our proxy for robust accuracy, rather than IBP-certified accuracy, as IBP bounds may be loose for models that were not trained with IBP. For data augmentation, we vary \\(K\\), the number of augmented examples per real example, from \\(1\\) to \\(64\\). For certifiably robust training, we vary \\(\\kappa^{\\star}\\), the weight of the certified robustness training objective, between \\(0.01\\) and \\(1.0\\). Figure 3 shows trade-off curves for the CNN model on \\(1000\\) random IMDB development set examples. Data augmentation can increase robustness somewhat, but cannot reach very high adversarial accuracy. With certifiably robust training, we can trade off some clean accuracy for much higher robust accuracy.\n\n### Runtime considerations\n\nIBP enables efficient computation of \\(u^{\\text{final}}(z,\\theta)\\), but it still incurs some overhead. Across model architectures, we found that one epoch of certifiably robust training takes between \\(2\\times\\) and \\(4\\times\\) longer than one epoch of standard training. On the other hand, IBP certificates are much faster to compute at test time than genetic attack accuracy. For the robustly trained CNN IMDB model, computing certificates on \\(1000\\) test examples took 5 seconds, while running the genetic attack on those same examples took over 3 hours.\n\n### Error analysis\n\nWe examined development set examples on which models were correct on the original input but incorrect on the perturbation found by the genetic attack. We refer to such cases as _robustness errors_. We focused on the CNN IMDB models trained normally, robustly, and with data augmentation. We found that robustness errors of the robustly trained model mostly occurred when it was not confident in its original prediction. The model had \\(>70\\%\\) confidence in the correct class for the original input in only \\(14\\%\\) of robustness errors. In contrast, the normally trained and data augmentation models were more confident on their robustness errors; they had \\(>70\\%\\) confidence on the original example in \\(92\\%\\) and \\(87\\%\\) of cases, respectively.\n\nWe next investigated how many words the genetic attack needed to change to cause misclassification, as shown in Figure 4. For the normally trained model, some robustness errors involved only a couple changed words (e.g., \"_Ive finally found a movie worse than..._\" was classified negative, but the same review with \"_Ive finally **discovered** a movie worse than..._\" was classified positive), but more changes were also common (e.g., part of a review was changed from \"_The creature looked very cheesy_\" to \"_The creature seemed supremely **darky_**\", with \\(15\\) words changed in total). Surprisingly, certifiably robust training nearly eliminated robustness errors in which the genetic attack had to change many words: the genetic attack either caused an error by changing a couple words, or was unable to trigger an error at all. In contrast, data augmentation is unable to cover the exponentially large space of perturbations that involve many words, so it does not prevent errors caused by changing many words.\n\n### Training schedule\n\nWe investigated the importance of slowly increasing \\(\\epsilon\\) during training, as suggested by Gowal et al. (2018). Fixing \\(\\epsilon=1\\) during training led to a \\(5\\) point reduction in certified accuracy for the CNN. On the other hand, we found that holding \\(\\kappa\\) fixed did not hurt accuracy, and in fact may be preferable. More details are shown in Appendix A.5.\n\n### Word vector analysis\n\nWe determined the importance of the extra feed-forward layer \\(g^{\\text{word}}\\) that we apply to pre-trained word vectors, as described in Section 4.2. We compared with directly using pre-trained word vectors, i.e. \\(\\phi(w)=\\phi^{\\text{pre}}(w)\\). We also tried using \\(g^{\\text{word}}\\) but applying interval bounds on \\(\\phi^{\\text{pre}}(w)\\), then computing bounds on \\(\\phi(w)\\) with the IBP for\n\nFigure 4: Number of words perturbed by the genetic attack to cause errors by CNN models on \\(1000\\) IMDB development set examples. Certifiably robust training reduces the effect of many simultaneous perturbations.\n\nmula for affine layers. In both cases, we could not train a CNN to achieve more than \\(52.2\\%\\) certified accuracy on the development set. Thus, transforming pre-trained word vectors and applying interval bounds _after_ is crucial for robust training. In Appendix A.6, we show that robust training makes the intervals around transformed word vectors smaller, compared to the pre-trained vectors.\n\n## 6 Related Work and Discussion\n\nRecent work on adversarial examples in NLP has proposed various classes of perturbations, such as insertion of extraneous text Jia and Liang (2017), word substitutions Alzantot et al. (2018), paraphrasing Iyyer et al. (2018); Ribeiro et al. (2018), and character-level noise Belinkov and Bisk (2017); Ebrahimi et al. (2017). These works focus mainly on demonstrating models' lack of robustness, and mostly do not explore ways to increase robustness beyond data augmentation. Data augmentation is effective for narrow perturbation spaces Jia and Liang (2017); Ribeiro et al. (2018), but only confers partial robustness in other cases Iyyer et al. (2018); Alzantot et al. (2018). Ebrahimi et al. (2017) tried adversarial training Goodfellow et al. (2015) for character-level perturbations, but could only use a fast heuristic attack at training time, due to runtime considerations. As a result, their models were still be fooled by running a more expensive search procedure at test time.\n\nProvable defenses have been studied for simpler NLP models and attacks, particularly for tasks like spam detection where real-life adversaries try to evade detection. Globerson and Roweis Globerson and Roweis (2006) train linear classifiers that are robust to adversarial feature deletion. Dalvi et al. Dalvi et al. (2004) analyzed optimal strategies for a Naive Bayes classifier and attacker, but their classifier only defends against a fixed attacker that does not adapt to the model.\n\nRecent work in computer vision Szegedy et al. (2014); Goodfellow et al. (2015) has sparked renewed interest in adversarial examples. Most work in this area focuses on \\(L_{\\infty}\\)-bounded perturbations, in which each input pixel can be changed by a small amount. The word substitution attack model we consider is similar to \\(L_{\\infty}\\) perturbations, as the adversary can change each input word by a small amount. Our work is inspired by work based on convex optimization Raghunathan et al. (2018); Wong and Kolter (2018) and builds directly on interval bound propagation Dvijotham et al. (2018); Gowal et al. (2018), which has certified robustness of computer vision models to \\(L_{\\infty}\\) attacks. Adversarial training via projected gradient descent Madry et al. (2018) has also been shown to improve robustness, but assumes that inputs are continuous. It could be applied in NLP by relaxing sets of word vectors to continuous regions.\n\nThis work provides certificates against word substitution perturbations for particular models. Since IBP is modular, it can be extended to other model architectures on other tasks. It is an open question whether IBP can give non-trivial bounds for sequence-to-sequence tasks like machine translation Belinkov and Bisk (2017); Michel et al. (2019). In principle, IBP can handle character-level types Ebrahimi et al. (2017); Pruthi et al. (2019), though typos yield more perturbations per word than we consider in this work. We are also interested in handling word insertions and deletions, rather than just substitutions. Finally, we would like to train models that get state-of-the-art clean accuracy while also being provably robust; achieving this remains an open problem.\n\nIn conclusion, state-of-the-art NLP models are accurate on average, but they still have significant blind spots. Certifiably robust training provides a general, principled mechanism to avoid such blind spots by encouraging models to make correct predictions on all inputs within some known perturbation neighborhood. This type of robustness is a necessary (but not sufficient) property of models that truly understand language. We hope that our work is a stepping stone towards models that are robust against an even wider, harder-to-characterize space of possible attacks.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by NSF Award Grant no. 1805310 and the DARPA ASED program under FA8650-18-2-7882.

(2018) showed how to compute interval bounds for affine transformations and monotonic element-wise functions. Here, we review their derivations, for completeness.\n\nAffine transformations.Affine transformations are the building blocks of neural networks. Suppose \\(z^{\\text{res}}=a^{\\top}z^{\\text{dep}}+b\\) for weight \\(a\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) and bias \\(b\\in\\mathbb{R}\\). \\(z^{\\text{res}}\\) is largest when positive entries of \\(a\\) are multiplied with \\(u^{\\text{dep}}\\) and negative with \\(\\ell^{\\text{dep}}\\):\n\n\\[u^{\\text{res}} =\\underbrace{0.5(a+|a|)^{\\top}}_{\\text{positive}}u^{\\text{dep}} +\\underbrace{0.5(a-|a|)^{\\top}}_{\\text{negative}}\\ell^{\\text{dep}}+b\\] \\[=\\mu+r, \\tag{9}\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mu=0.5a^{\\top}(\\ell^{\\text{dep}}+u^{\\text{dep}})+b\\) and \\(r=0.5|a|^{\\top}(u-l)\\). A similar computation yields that \\(\\ell^{\\text{res}}=\\mu-r\\). Therefore, the interval \\(\\mathcal{O}^{\\text{res}}\\) can be computed using two inner product evaluations: one with \\(a\\) and one with \\(|a|\\).\n\nMonotonic scalar functions.Activation functions such as ReLU, sigmoid and tanh are monotonic. Suppose \\(z^{\\text{res}}=\\sigma(z^{\\text{dep}})\\) where \\(z^{\\text{res}},z^{\\text{dep}}\\in\\mathbb{R}\\), i.e. the node applies an element-wise function to its input. The intervals can be computed trivially since \\(z^{\\text{res}}\\) is minimized at \\(\\ell^{\\text{dep}}\\) and maximized at \\(u^{\\text{dep}}\\).\n\n\\[\\ell^{\\text{res}}=\\sigma(\\ell^{\\text{dep}}),\\;\\;u^{\\text{res}}=\\sigma(u^{\\text {dep}}). \\tag{10}\\]\n\n### Numerical stability of softmax\n\nIn this section, we show how to compute interval bounds for softmax layers in a numerically stable way. We will do this by showing how to handle log-softmax layers. Note that since softmax is just exponentiated log-softmax, and exponentiation is monotonic, bounds on log-softmax directly yield bounds on softmax.\n\nLet \\(z^{\\text{dep}}\\) denote a vector of length \\(m\\), let \\(c\\) be an integer \\(\\in\\{1,\\dots,m\\}\\), and let \\(z^{\\text{res}}\\) represent the log-softmax score of index \\(c\\), i.e.\n\n\\[z^{\\text{res}} =\\log\\frac{\\exp(z_{c}^{\\text{dep}})}{\\sum_{j=1}^{m}\\exp(z_{j}^{ \\text{dep}})} \\tag{11}\\] \\[=z_{c}^{\\text{dep}}-\\log\\sum_{j=1}^{m}\\exp(z_{j}^{\\text{dep}}). \\tag{12}\\]\n\nGiven interval bounds \\(\\ell_{j}\\leq z_{j}^{\\text{dep}}\\leq u_{j}\\) for each \\(j\\), we show how to compute upper and lower bounds on \\(z^{\\text{res}}\\). For any vector \\(v\\), we assume access to a subroutine that computes\n\n\\[\\operatorname{logsumexp}(v)=\\log\\sum_{i}\\exp(v_{i})\\]\n\nstably. The standard way to compute this is to normalize \\(v\\) by subtracting \\(\\max_{i}(v_{i})\\) before taking exponentials, then add it back at the end. \\(\\operatorname{logsumexp}\\) is a standard function in libraries like PyTorch. We will also rely on the fact that if \\(v\\) is the concatenation of vectors \\(u\\) and \\(w\\), then \\(\\operatorname{logsumexp}(v)=\\operatorname{logsumexp}([\\operatorname{logsumexp} (u),\\operatorname{logsumexp}(w)])\\).\n\nUpper bound.The upper bound \\(u^{\\text{res}}\\) is achieved by having the maximum value of \\(z_{c}^{\\text{dep}}\\), and minimum value of all others. This can be written as:\n\n\\[u^{\\text{res}}=u_{c}^{\\text{dep}}-\\log\\left(\\exp(u_{c}^{\\text{dep}})+\\sum_{1 \\leq j\\leq m,j\\neq c}\\exp(\\ell_{j}^{\\text{dep}})\\right). \\tag{13}\\]\n\nWhile we could directly compute this expression, it is difficult to vectorize. Instead, with some rearranging, we get\n\n\\[u^{\\text{res}}=u_{c}^{\\text{dep}}-\\log\\left(\\exp(u_{c}^{\\text{dep}})-\\exp(\\ell _{c}^{\\text{dep}})+\\sum_{j=1}^{m}\\exp(\\ell_{j}^{\\text{dep}})\\right). \\tag{14}\\]\n\nThe second term is the \\(\\operatorname{logsumexp}\\) of\n\n\\[\\log\\left(\\exp(u_{c}^{\\text{dep}})-\\exp(\\ell_{c}^{\\text{dep}})\\right) \\tag{15}\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\\operatorname{logsumexp}(\\ell^{\\text{dep}}). \\tag{16}\\]Since we know how to compute \\(\\operatorname{logsumexp}\\), this reduces to computing (15). Note that (15) can be rewritten as\n\n\\[u_{c}^{\\text{dep}}+\\log\\big{(}1-\\exp(\\ell_{c}^{\\text{dep}}-u_{c}^{\\text{dep}}) \\big{)} \\tag{17}\\]\n\nby adding and subtracting \\(u_{c}^{\\text{dep}}\\). To compute this quantity, we consider two cases:\n\n1. \\(u_{c}^{\\text{dep}}\\gg\\ell_{c}^{\\text{dep}}\\). Here we use the fact that stable methods exist to compute \\(\\log\\!1\\!p(x)=\\log(1+x)\\) for \\(x\\) close to \\(0\\). We compute the desired value as \\[u_{c}^{\\text{dep}}+\\log 1p(-\\exp(\\ell_{c}^{\\text{dep}}-u_{c}^{\\text{dep}})),\\] since \\(\\exp(\\ell_{c}^{\\text{dep}}-u_{c}^{\\text{dep}})\\) will be close to \\(0\\).\n2. \\(u_{c}^{\\text{dep}}\\) close to \\(\\ell_{c}^{\\text{dep}}\\). Here we use the fact that stable methods exist to compute \\(\\operatorname{expm}1(x)=\\exp(x)-1\\) for \\(x\\) close to \\(0\\). We compute the desired value as \\[u_{c}^{\\text{dep}}+\\log(-\\operatorname{expm}1(\\ell_{c}^{\\text{dep}}-u_{c}^{ \\text{dep}})),\\] since \\(\\ell_{c}^{\\text{dep}}-u_{c}^{\\text{dep}}\\) may be close to \\(0\\).\n\nWe use case 1 if \\(u_{c}^{\\text{dep}}-\\ell_{c}^{\\text{dep}}>\\log 2\\), and case 2 otherwise.5\n\nFootnote 5: See [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rmpfr/vignettes/loglmexp-note.pdf](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rmpfr/vignettes/loglmexp-note.pdf) for further explanation.\n\nLower bound.The lower bound \\(\\ell^{\\text{res}}\\) is achieved by having the minimum value of \\(z_{c}^{\\text{dep}}\\), and the maximum value of all others. This can be written as:\n\n\\[\\ell^{\\text{res}}=\\ell_{c}^{\\text{dep}}-\\log\\left(\\exp(\\ell_{c}^{\\text{dep}}) +\\sum_{1\\leq j\\leq m,j\\neq c}\\exp(u_{j}^{\\text{dep}})\\right). \\tag{18}\\]\n\nThe second term is just a normal \\(\\operatorname{logsumexp}\\), which is easy to compute. To vectorize the implementation, it helps to first compute the \\(\\operatorname{logsumexp}\\) of everything except \\(\\ell_{c}^{\\text{dep}}\\), and then \\(\\operatorname{logsumexp}\\) that with \\(\\ell_{c}^{\\text{dep}}\\).\n\n### Attack surface differences\n\nIn Alzantot et al. (2018), the adversary applies replacements one at a time, and the neighborhoods and language model scores are computed relative to the current altered version of the input. This results in a hard-to-define attack surface, as the same word can be replaced many times, leading to semantic drift. We instead pre-compute the allowed substitutions \\(S(x,i)\\) at index \\(i\\) based on the original \\(x\\). We define \\(S(x,i)\\) as the set of \\(\\tilde{x}_{i}\\in N(x_{i})\\) such that\n\n\\[\\log\\!P(x_{i-W:i-1},\\tilde{x}_{i},x_{i+1:i+W})\\geq\\] \\[\\log P(x_{i-W:i+W})-\\delta \\tag{19}\\]\n\nwhere probabilities are assigned by a pre-trained language model, and the window radius \\(W\\) and threshold \\(\\delta\\) are hyperparameters. We use \\(W=6\\) and \\(\\delta=5\\). We also use a different language model6 from Alzantot et al. (2018) that achieves perplexity of \\(50.79\\) on the One Billion Word dataset (Chelba et al., 2013). Alzantot et al. (2018) use a different, slower language model, which compels them to use a smaller window radius of \\(W=1\\).\n\nFootnote 6: [https://github.com/windweller/l2w](https://github.com/windweller/l2w)\n\n### Experimental details\n\nWe do not run training for a set number of epochs but do early stopping on the development set instead. For normal training, we early stop on normal development set accuracy. For training with data augmentation, we early stop on the accuracy on the augmented development set. For certifiably robust training, we early stop on the certifiably robust accuracy on the development set. We use the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014) to train all models.\n\nOn IMDB, we restrict the model to only use the \\(50,000\\) words that are in the vocabulary of the counter-fitted word vector space of Mrksic et al. (2016). This is because perturbations are not allowed for any words not in this vocabulary, i.e. \\(N(w)=\\{w\\}\\) for \\(w\\notin V\\). Therefore, the model is strongly incentivized to predict based on words outside of this set. While this is a valid way to achieve high certified accuracy, it is not a valid robustness strategy in general. We simply delete all words that are not in the vocabulary before feeding the input to the model.\n\nFor SNLI, we use \\(100\\)-dimensional hidden state for the BoW model and a \\(3\\)-layer feedforward network. These values were chosen by a hyperparameter search on the dev set. For DecompAttn, we use a \\(300\\)-dimensional hidden state and a \\(2\\)-layer feedforward network on top of the context-aware vectors. These values were chosen to match Parikh et al. (2016).\n\nOur implementation of the Decomposable Attention follows the original described in [16] except for a few differences listed below;\n\n* We do not normalize GloVe vectors to have norm 1.\n* We do not hash out-of-vocabulary words to randomly generated vectors that we train, instead we omit them.\n* We do randomly generate a null token vector that we then train. (Whether the null vector is trained is unspecified in the original paper).\n* We use the Adam optimizer (with a learning rate of \\(1\\times 10^{-4}\\)) instead of AdaGrad.\n* We use a batch size of 256 instead of 4.\n* We use a dropout probability of \\(0.1\\) instead of \\(0.2\\)\n* We do not use the intra-sentence attention module.\n\n### Training schedule\n\nIn Table 4, we show the effect of holding \\(\\epsilon\\) or \\(\\kappa\\) fixed during training, as described in Section 5.6. All numbers are on \\(1000\\) randomly chosen examples from the IMDB development set. Slowly increasing \\(\\epsilon\\) is important for good performance. Slowly increasing \\(\\kappa\\) is actually slightly worse than holding \\(\\kappa=\\kappa^{*}\\) fixed during training, despite earlier experiments we ran suggesting the opposite. Here we only report certified accuracy, as all models are trained with certifiably robust training, and certified accuracy is much faster to compute for development purposes.\n\n### Word vector bound sizes\n\nTo better understand the effect of \\(g^{\\text{word}}\\), we checked whether \\(g^{\\text{word}}\\) made interval bound boxes around neighborhoods \\(N(w)\\) smaller. For each word \\(w\\) with \\(|N(w)|>1\\), and for both the pre-trained vectors \\(\\phi^{\\text{pre}}(\\cdot)\\) and transformed vectors \\(\\phi(\\cdot)\\), we compute\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{d}\\sum_{i=1}^{d}\\frac{1}{\\sigma_{i}}\\left(u_{w}^{\\text{word}}-\\ell_{w }^{\\text{word}}\\right)\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\ell_{w}^{\\text{word}}\\) and \\(u_{w}^{\\text{word}}\\) are the interval bounds around either \\(\\{\\phi^{\\text{pre}}(\\tilde{w}):\\tilde{w}\\in N(w)\\}\\) or \\(\\{\\phi(\\tilde{w}):\\tilde{w}\\in N(w)\\}\\), and \\(\\sigma_{i}\\) is the standard deviation across the vocabulary of the \\(i\\)-th coordinate of the embeddings. This quantity measures the average width of the IBP bounds for the word vectors of \\(w\\) and its neighbors, normalized by the standard deviation in each coordinate. On \\(78.2\\%\\) of words with \\(|N(w)|>1\\), this value was smaller for the transformed vectors learned by the CNN on IMDB with robust training, compared to the GloVe vectors. For same model with normal training, the value was smaller only \\(54.5\\%\\) of the time, implying that robust training makes the transformation produce tighter bounds. We observed the same pattern for other model architectures as well.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \\hline \\multirow{2}{*}{System} & \\multicolumn{2}{c|}{IBP-certified (Lower bound)} \\\\ \\hline BOW & \\(68.8\\) \\\\ \\(\\rightarrow\\) Fixed \\(\\epsilon\\) & \\(46.6\\) \\\\ \\(\\rightarrow\\) Fixed \\(\\kappa\\) & \\(69.8\\) \\\\ \\(\\rightarrow\\) Fixed \\(\\epsilon\\) and \\(\\kappa\\) & \\(66.3\\) \\\\ \\hline CNN & \\(72.5\\) \\\\ \\(\\rightarrow\\) Fixed \\(\\epsilon\\) & \\(67.6\\) \\\\ \\(\\rightarrow\\) Fixed \\(\\kappa\\) & \\(74.5\\) \\\\ \\(\\rightarrow\\) Fixed \\(\\epsilon\\) and \\(\\kappa\\) & \\(65.3\\) \\\\ \\hline LSTM & \\(62.5\\) \\\\ \\(\\rightarrow\\) Fixed \\(\\epsilon\\) & \\(43.7\\) \\\\ \\(\\rightarrow\\) Fixed \\(\\kappa\\) & \\(63.0\\) \\\\ \\(\\rightarrow\\) Fixed \\(\\epsilon\\) and \\(\\kappa\\) & \\(62.0\\) \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 4: Effects of holding \\(\\epsilon\\) and \\(\\kappa\\) fixed during training.

The same hyperparameters were used for all training settings(plain, data augmentation, robust training)\n\n### Certifying long-term memory\n\nWe might expect that LSTMs are difficult to certify with IBP, due to their long computation paths. To test whether robust training can learn recurrent models that track state across many time steps, we created a toy binary classification task where the input is a sequence of words \\(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{L}\\), and the label \\(y\\) is \\(1\\) if \\(x_{1}=x_{L}\\) and \\(0\\) otherwise. We trained an LSTM model that reads the input left-to-right, and tries to predict \\(y\\) with a two-layer feedforward network on top of the final hidden state. To do this task, the model must encode the first word in its state and remember it until the final timestep; a bag of words model cannot do this task. For perturbations, we allow replacing every middle word \\(x_{2},\\ldots,x_{L-1}\\) with any word in the vocabulary. We use robust training on \\(4000\\) randomly generated examples, where the length of each example is sampled uniformly between \\(3\\) and \\(10\\). The model obtains \\(100\\%\\) certified accuracy on a test set of \\(1000\\) examples, confirming that robust training can learn models that track state across many time steps.\n\nFor this experiment, we found it important to first train for multiple epochs with no certified objective, before increasing \\(\\epsilon\\) and \\(\\kappa\\).

On certain datasets, recent deep learning entailment systems (Parikh et al., 2016; Wang\net al., 2017; Gong et al., 2018) have achieved\nclose to human level performance. Nevertheless,\nthe problem is far from solved, as evidenced by\nhow easy it is to generate minor adversarial ex-\nTable 1: Failure examples from the SNLI dataset:\nnegation (Top) and re-ordering (Bottom).\nP is\npremise, H is hypothesis, and S is prediction made\nby an entailment system (Parikh et al., 2016).\nP: The dog did not eat all of the chickens.\nH: The dog ate all of the chickens.\nS: entails (score 56.5%)\nP: The red box is in the blue box.\nH: The blue box is in the red box.\nS: entails (score 92.1%)\namples that break even the best systems. As Table 1 illustrates, a state-of-the-art neural system\nfor this task, namely the Decomposable Attention\nModel (Parikh et al., 2016), fails when faced with\nsimple linguistic phenomena such as negation, or\na re-ordering of words. This is not unique to a\nparticular model or task. Minor adversarial examples have also been found to easily break neural\nsystems on other linguistic tasks such as reading\ncomprehension (Jia and Liang, 2017).\nA key contributor to this brittleness is the use\nof specific datasets such as SNLI (Bowman et al.,\n2015) and SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) to drive\nmodel development. While large and challenging,\nthese datasets also tend to be homogeneous. E.g.,\nSNLI was created by asking crowd-source workers to generate entailing sentences, which then\ntend to have limited linguistic variations and annotation artifacts (Gururangan et al., 2018). Consequently, models overfit to sufficiently repetitive\npatterns\u2014and sometimes idiosyncrasies\u2014in the\ndatasets they are trained on. They fail to cover\nlong-tail and rare patterns in the training distribution, or linguistic phenomena such as negation that\nwould be obvious to a layperson.\nTo address this challenge, we propose to train\ntextual entailment models more robustly using ad-\narXiv:1805.04680v1  [cs.CL]  12 May 2018\n\fversarial examples generated in two ways: (a)\nby incorporating knowledge from large linguistic\nresources, and (b) using a sequence-to-sequence\nneural model in a GAN-style framework.\nThe motivation stems from the following observation. While deep-learning based textual entailment models lead the pack, they generally do\nnot incorporate intuitive rules such as negation,\nand ignore large-scale linguistic resources such\nas PPDB (Ganitkevitch et al., 2013) and WordNet (Miller, 1995). These resources could help\nthem generalize beyond specific words observed\nduring training.\nFor instance, while the SNLI\ndataset contains the pattern two men \u22a8 people, it\ndoes not contain the analogous pattern two dogs \u22a8\nanimals found easily in WordNet.\nEffectively integrating simple rules or linguistic resources in a deep learning model, however,\nis challenging. Doing so directly by substantially\nadapting the model architecture (Sha et al., 2016;\nChen et al., 2018) can be cumbersome and limiting. Incorporating such knowledge indirectly via\nmodified word embeddings (Faruqui et al., 2015;\nMrk\u02c7si\u00b4c et al., 2016), as we show, can have little\npositive impact and can even be detrimental.\nOur proposed method, which is task-specific\nbut model-independent,\nis inspired by dataaugmentation techniques.\nWe generate new\ntraining examples by applying knowledge-guided\nrules, via only a handful of rule templates, to the\noriginal training examples.\nSimultaneously, we\nalso use a sequence-to-sequence or seq2seq model\nfor each entailment class to generate new hypotheses from a given premise, adaptively creating new\nadversarial examples. These can be used with any\nentailment model without constraining model architecture.\nWe also introduce the first approach to train a\nrobust entailment model using a Generative Adversarial Network or GAN (Goodfellow et al.,\n2014) style framework.\nWe iteratively improve\nboth the entailment system (the discriminator)\nand the differentiable part of the data-augmenter\n(specifically the neural generator), by training\nthe generator based on the discriminator\u2019s performance on the generated examples. Importantly,\nunlike the typical use of GANs to create a strong\ngenerator, we use it as a mechanism to create a\nstrong and robust discriminator.\nOur new entailment system, called AdvEntuRe,\ndemonstrates that in the moderate data regime,\nadversarial iterative data-augmentation via only a\nhandful of linguistic rule templates can be surprisingly powerful. Specifically, we observe 4.7%\naccuracy improvement on the challenging SciTail\ndataset (Khot et al., 2018) and a 2.8% improvement on 10K-50K training subsets of SNLI. An\nevaluation of our algorithm on the negation examples in the test set of SNLI reveals a 6.1% improvement from just a single rule.\n2\nRelated Work\nAdversarial example generation has recently received much attention in NLP. For example, Jia\nand Liang (2017) generate adversarial examples\nusing manually defined templates for the SQuAD\nreading comprehension task.\nGlockner et al.\n(2018) create an adversarial dataset from SNLI\nby using WordNet knowledge. Automatic methods (Iyyer et al., 2018) have also been proposed to\ngenerate adversarial examples through paraphrasing. These works reveal how neural network systems trained on a large corpus can easily break\nwhen faced with carefully designed unseen adversarial patterns at test time. Our motivation is\ndifferent. We use adversarial examples at training time, in a data augmentation setting, to train a\nmore robust entailment discriminator. The generator uses explicit knowledge or hand written rules,\nand is trained in a end-to-end fashion along with\nthe discriminator.\nIncorporating external rules or linguistic resources in a deep learning model generally requires substantially adapting the model architecture (Sha et al., 2016; Liang et al., 2017; Kang\net al., 2017). This is a model-dependent approach,\nwhich can be cumbersome and constraining. Similarly non-neural textual entailment models have\nbeen developed that incorporate knowledge bases.\nHowever, these also require model-specific engineering (Raina et al., 2005; Haghighi et al., 2005;\nSilva et al., 2018).\nAn\nalternative\nis\nthe\nmodeland\ntaskindependent\nroute\nof\nincorporating\nlinguistic resources via word embeddings that are\nretro-fitted (Faruqui et al., 2015) or counterfitted (Mrk\u02c7si\u00b4c et al., 2016) to such resources. We\ndemonstrate, however, that this has little positive\nimpact in our setting and can even be detrimental.\nFurther, it is unclear how to incorporate\nknowledge sources into advanced representations\nsuch as contextual embeddings (McCann et al.,\n\f2017; Peters et al., 2018).\nWe thus focus on a\ntask-specific but model-independent approach.\nLogical rules have also been defined to label existing examples based on external resources (Hu\net al., 2016). Our focus here is on generating new\ntraining examples.\nOur use of the GAN framework to create a better discriminator is related to CatGANs (Wang and\nZhang, 2017) and TripleGANs (Chongxuan et al.,\n2017) where the discriminator is trained to classify\nthe original training image classes as well as a new\n\u2018fake\u2019 image class. We, on the other hand, generate examples belonging to the same classes as the\ntraining examples. Further, unlike the earlier focus on the vision domain, this is the first approach\nto train a discriminator using GANs for a natural\nlanguage task with discrete outputs.\n3\nAdversarial Example Generation\nWe present three different techniques to create adversarial examples for textual entailment. Specifically, we show how external knowledge resources,\nhand-authored rules, and neural language generation models can be used to generate such examples. Before describing these generators in detail,\nwe introduce the notation used henceforth.\nWe use lower-case letters for single instances\n(e.g., x, p, h), upper-case letters for sets of instances (e.g., X, P, H), blackboard bold for models (e.g., D), and calligraphic symbols for discrete\nspaces of possible values (e.g., class labels C). For\nthe textual entailment task, we assume each example is represented as a triple (p, h, c), where p is\na premise (a natural language sentence), h is a hypothesis, and c is an entailment label: (a) entails\n(\u2291) if h is true whenever p is true; (b) contradicts\n(\u22cf) if h is false whenever p is true; or (c) neutral\n(#) if the truth value of h cannot be concluded from\np being true.1\nWe will introduce various example generators\nin the rest of this section. Each such generator,\nG\u03c1, is defined by a partial function f\u03c1 and a label\ng\u03c1. If a sentence s has a certain property required\nby f\u03c1 (e.g., contains a particular string), f\u03c1 transforms it into another sentence s\u2032 and g\u03c1 provides\nan entailment label from s to s\u2032. Applied to a sentence s, G\u03c1 thus either \u201cfails\u201d (if the pre-requisite\nisn\u2019t met) or generates a new entailment example triple,\n\ufffd\ns, f\u03c1(s), g\u03c1\n\ufffd\n. For instance, consider the\n1The symbols are based on Natural Logic (Lakoff, 1970)\nand use the notation of MacCartney and Manning (2012).\nSource\n\u03c1\nf\u03c1(s)\ng\u03c1\nKnowledge Base, GKB\nWordNet\nhyper(x, y)\n\u2291\nanto(x, y)\n\u22cf\nsyno(x, y)\nReplace x\nwith y in s\n\u2291\nPPDB\nx \u2261 y\n\u2291\nSICK\nc(x, y)\nc\nHand-authored, GH\nDomain knowledge\nneg\nnegate(s)\n\u22cf\nNeural Model, Gs2s\nTraining data\n(s2s, c)\nGs2s\nc (s)\nc\nTable 2: Various generators G\u03c1 characterized by\ntheir source, (partial) transformation function f\u03c1 as\napplied to a sentence s, and entailment label g\u03c1\ngenerator for \u03c1:=hypernym(car, vehicle) with the\n(partial) transformation function f\u03c1:=\u201cReplace car\nwith vehicle\u201d and the label g\u03c1:=entails. f\u03c1 would\nfail when applied to a sentence not containing the\nword \u201ccar\u201d.\nApplying f\u03c1 to the sentence s=\u201cA\nman is driving the car\u201d would generate s\u2019=\u201cA\nman is driving the vehicle\u201d, creating the example\n(s, s\u2032, entails).\nThe seven generators we use for experimentation are summarized in Table 2 and discussed in\nmore detail subsequently.\nWhile these particular generators are simplistic and one can easily\nimagine more advanced ones, we show that training using adversarial examples created using even\nthese simple generators leads to substantial accuracy improvement on two datasets.\n3.1\nKnowledge-Guided Generators\nLarge knowledge-bases such as WordNet and\nPPDB contain lexical equivalences and other relationships highly relevant for entailment models.\nHowever, even large datasets such as SNLI generally do not contain most of these relationships\nin the training data. E.g., that two dogs entails\nanimals isn\u2019t captured in the SNLI data. We define simple generators based on lexical resources\nto create adversarial examples that capture the underlying knowledge. This allows models trained\non these examples to learn these relationships.\nAs discussed earlier, there are different ways\nof incorporating such symbolic knowledge into\nneural models. Unlike task-agnostic ways of approaching this goal from a word embedding perspective (Faruqui et al., 2015; Mrk\u02c7si\u00b4c et al., 2016)\n\for the model-specific approach (Sha et al., 2016;\nChen et al., 2018), we use this knowledge to generate task-specific examples. This allows any entailment model to learn how to use these relationships\nin the context of the entailment task, helping them\noutperform the above task-agnostic alternative.\nOur\nknowledge-guided\nexample\ngenerators, GKB\n\u03c1 , use lexical relations available in a\nknowledge-base: \u03c1 := r(x, y) where the relation\nr (such as synonym, hypernym, etc.) may differ\nacross knowledge bases. We use a simple (partial)\ntransformation function, f\u03c1(s):=\u201cReplace x in s\nwith y\u201d, as described in an earlier example. In\nsome cases, when part-of-speech (POS) tags are\navailable, the partial function requires the tags for\nx in s and in r(x, y) to match. The entailment label\ng\u03c1 for the resulting examples is also defined based\non the relation r, as summarized in Table 2.\nThis idea is similar to Natural Logic Inference\nor NLI (Lakoff, 1970; Sommers, 1982; Angeli\nand Manning, 2014) where words in a sentence\ncan be replaced by their hypernym/hyponym to\nproduce entailing/neutral sentences, depending on\ntheir context. We propose a context-agnostic use\nof lexical resources that, despite its simplicity, already results in significant gains. We use three\nsources for generators:\nWordNet\n(Miller, 1995) is a large, handcurated, semantic lexicon with synonymous words\ngrouped into synsets. Synsets are connected by\nmany semantic relations, from which we use hyponym and synonym relations to generate entailing\nsentences, and antonym relations to generate contradicting sentences2. Given a relation r(x, y), the\n(partial) transformation function f\u03c1 is the POS-tag\nmatched replacement of x in s with y, and requires\nthe POS tag to be noun or verb. NLI provides a\nmore robust way of using these relations based on\ncontext, which we leave for future work.\nPPDB\n(Ganitkevitch et al., 2013) is a large\nresource of lexical, phrasal, and syntactic paraphrases.\nWe use 24,273 lexical paraphrases in\ntheir smallest set, PPDB-S (Pavlick et al., 2015),\nas equivalence relations, x \u2261 y. The (partial) transformation function f\u03c1 for this generator is POStagged matched replacement of x in s with y, and\nthe label g\u03c1 is entails.\n2A similar approach was used in a parallel work to generate an adversarial dataset from SNLI (Glockner et al., 2018).\nSICK\n(Marelli et al., 2014) is dataset with entailment examples of the form (p, h, c), created to\nevaluate an entailment model\u2019s ability to capture\ncompositional knowledge via hand-authored rules.\nWe use the 12,508 patterns of the form c(x, y) extracted by Beltagy et al. (2016) by comparing sentences in this dataset, with the property that for\neach SICK example (p, h, c), replacing (when applicable) x with y in p produces h. For simplicity,\nwe ignore positional information in these patterns.\nThe (partial) transformation function f\u03c1 is replacement of x in s with y, and the label g\u03c1 is c.\n3.2\nHand-Defined Generators\nEven very large entailment datasets have no or\nvery few examples of certain otherwise common\nlinguistic constructs such as negation,3 causing\nmodels trained on them to struggle with these constructs. A simple model-agnostic way to alleviate this issue is via a negation example generator\nwhose transformation function f\u03c1(s) is negate(s),\ndescribed below, and the label g\u03c1 is contradicts.\nnegate(s): If s contains a \u2018be\u2019 verb (e.g., is,\nwas), add a \u201cnot\u201d after the verb. If not, also add\na \u201cdid\u201d or \u201cdo\u201d in front based on its tense. E.g.,\nchange \u201cA person is crossing\u201d to \u201cA person is not\ncrossing\u201d and \u201cA person crossed\u201d to \u201cA person\ndid not cross.\u201d While many other rules could be\nadded, we found that this single rule covered a\nmajority of the cases. Verb tenses are also considered4 and changed accordingly. Other functions\nsuch as dropping adverbial clauses or changing\ntenses could be defined in a similar manner.\nBoth the knowledge-guided and hand-defined\ngenerators make local changes to the sentences\nbased on simple rules. It should be possible to extend the hand-defined rules to cover the long tail\n(as long as they are procedurally definable). However, a more scalable approach would be to extend\nour generators to trainable models that can cover\na wider range of phenomena than hand-defined\nrules. Moreover, the applicability of these rules\ngenerally depends on the context which can also\nbe incorporated in such trainable generators.\n3.3\nNeural Generators\nFor each entailment class c, we use a trainable\nsequence-to-sequence neural model (Sutskever\n3Only 211 examples (2.11%) in the SNLI training set contain negation triggers such as not, \u2019nt, etc.\n4https://www.nodebox.net/code/index.php/Linguistics\n\fet al., 2014; Luong et al., 2015) to generate an entailment example (s, s\u2032, c) from an input sentence\ns. The seq2seq model, trained on examples labeled c, itself acts as the transformation function\nf\u03c1 of the corresponding generator Gs2s\nc . The label g\u03c1 is set to c. The joint probability of seq2seq\nmodel is:\nGs2s\nc (Xc; \u03c6c) = Gs2s\nc (Hc, Pc; \u03c6c)\n(1)\n= \u03a0iP(hi,c|pi,c; \u03c6c)P(hi)\n(2)\nThe loss function for training the seq2seq is:\n\u02c6\u03c6c = argmin\n\u03c6c\nL(Hc, Gs2s\nc (Xc; \u03c6c))\n(3)\nwhere L is the cross-entropy loss between the\noriginal hypothesis Hc and the predicted hypothesis. Cross-entropy is computed for each predicted\nword wi against the same in Hc given the sequence\nof previous words in Hc .\n\u02c6\u03c6c are the optimal parameters in Gs2s\nc\nthat minimize the loss for class c.\nWe use the single most likely output to generate\nsentences in order to reduce decoding time.\n3.4\nExample Generation\nThe generators described above are used to create new entailment examples from the training\ndata. For each example (p, h, c) in the data, we\ncan create two new examples:\n\ufffd\np, f\u03c1(p), g\u03c1\n\ufffd\nand\n\ufffd\nh, f\u03c1(h), g\u03c1\n\ufffd\n.\nThe examples generated this way using GKB\nand GH can, however, be relatively easy, as the\npremise and hypothesis would differ by only a\nword or so. We therefore compose such simple\n(\u201cfirst-order\u201d) generated examples with the original input example to create more challenging\n\u201csecond-order\u201d examples. We can create secondorder examples by composing the original example (p, h, c) with a generated sentence from hypothesis, f\u03c1(h) and premise, f\u03c1(p). Figure 1 depicts how these two kinds of examples are generated from an input example (p, h, c).\nFirst, we consider the second-order example between the original premise and the transformed\nhypothesis: (p, f\u03c1(h),\n\ufffd\n(c, g\u03c1)), where\n\ufffd\n, defined in the left half of Table 3, composes the input\nexample label c (connecting p and h) and the generated example label g\u03c1 to produce a new label.\nFor instance, if p entails h and h entails f\u03c1(h), p\nwould entail f\u03c1. In other words,\n\ufffd\n(\u2291, \u2291) is \u2291.

For example, if\np entails f\u03c1(p) and p entails h, the relation between f\u03c1(p) and h is undetermined i.e.\n\ufffd\n(\u2291, \u2291\n) =?. While this particular composition\n\ufffd\noften\nleads to undetermined or neutral relations, we use\nit here for completeness. For example, composing the previous example with a generated neutral\npremise, f\u03c1(p): \u201cA person is wearing a cap\u201d would\ngenerate an example (\u201cA person is wearing a cap\u201d,\n\u201cA man is playing a game\u201d, #)\nThe composition function\n\ufffd\nis the same\nas the \u201cjoin\u201d operation in natural logic reasoning (Icard III and Moss, 2014), except for two differences: (a) relations that do not belong to our\nthree entailment classes are mapped to \u2018?\u2019, and\n\f(b) the exclusivity/alternation relation is mapped\nto contradicts. The composition function\n\ufffd\n, on\nthe other hand, does not map to the join operation.\n3.5\nImplementation Details\nGiven the original training examples X, we generate the examples from each premise and hypothesis in a batch using GKB and GH. We also generate\nnew hypothesis per class for each premise using\nGs2s\nc . Using all the generated examples to train the\nmodel would, however, overwhelm the original\ntraining set. For examples, our knowledge-guided\ngenerators GKB can be applied in 17,258,314 different ways.\nTo avoid this, we sub-sample our synthetic examples to ensure that they are proportional to the\ninput examples X, specifically they are bounded to\n\u03b1|X| where \u03b1 is tuned for each dataset. Also, as\nseen in Table 3, our knowledge-guided generators\nare more likely to generate neutral examples than\nany other class. To make sure that the labels are\nnot skewed, we also sub-sample the examples to\nensure that our generated examples have the same\nclass distribution as the input batch. The SciTail\ndataset only contains two classes: entails mapped\nto \u2291 and neutral mapped to \u22cf. As a result, generated examples that do not belong to these two\nclasses are ignored.\nThe sub-sampling, however, has a negative sideeffect where our generated examples end up using a small number of lexical relations from the\nlarge knowledge bases. On moderate datasets, this\nwould cause the entailment model to potentially\njust memorize these few lexical relations. Hence,\nwe generate new entailment examples for each\nmini-batch and update the model parameters based\non the training+generated examples in this batch.\nThe overall example generation procedure goes\nas follows: For each mini-batch X (1) randomly\nchoose 3 applicable rules per source and sentence\n(e.g., replacing men with people based on PPDB in\npremise is one rule), (2) produce examples Zall using GKB, GH and Gs2s, (3) randomly sub-select examples Z from Zall to ensure the balance between\nclasses and |Z|= \u03b1|X|.\n4\nAdvEntuRe\nFigure 2 shows the complete architecture of our\nmodel, AdvEntuRe (ADVersarial training for textual ENTailment Using Rule-based Examples.).\nThe entailment model D is shown with the white\nbox and two proposed generators are shown using\nblack boxes. We combine the two symbolic untrained generators, GKB and GH into a single Grule\nmodel. We combine the generated adversarial examples Z with the original training examples X to\ntrain the discriminator. Next, we describe how the\nindividual models are trained and finally present\nour new approach to train the generator based on\nthe discriminator\u2019s performance.\n4.1\nDiscriminator Training\nWe use one of the state-of-the-art entailment models (at the time of its publication) on SNLI, decomposable attention model (Parikh et al., 2016)\nwith intra-sentence attention as our discriminator\nD. The model attends each word in hypothesis\nwith each word in the premise, compares each pair\nof the attentions, and then aggregates them as a final representation. This discriminator model can\nbe easily replaced with any other entailment model\nwithout any other change to the AdvEntuRe architecture. We pre-train our discriminator D on the\noriginal dataset, X=(P, H, C) using:\nD(X; \u03b8) = argmax\n\u02c6C\nD( \u02c6C|P, H; \u03b8)\n(4)\n\u02c6\u03b8 = argmin\n\u03b8\nL(C, D(X; \u03b8))\n(5)\nwhere L is cross-entropy loss function between the\ntrue labels, Y and the predicted classes, and \u02c6\u03b8 are\nthe learned parameters.\n4.2\nGenerator Training\nOur knowledge-guided and hand-defined generators are symbolic parameter-less methods which\nare not currently trained. For simplicity, we will\nrefer to the set of symbolic rule-based generators\nas Grule := GKB \u222a GH. The neural generator Gs2s,\non the other hand, can be trained as described earlier. We leave the training of the symbolic models\nfor future work.\n4.3\nAdversarial Training\nWe now present our approach to iteratively train\nthe discriminator and generator in a GAN-style\nframework. Unlike traditional GAN (Goodfellow\net al., 2014) on image/text generation that aims\nto obtain better generators, our goal is to build\na robust discriminator regularized by the generators (Gs2s and Grule). The discriminator and generator are iteratively trained against each other to\nachieve better discrimination on the augmented\n\f[H \u2192 H\u2019, WordNet(\"part of\u201d \u2192 \u201cpiece of\u201d), C] The \nchromosomes are a piece of our body cells\n[P \u2192 P\u2019, NEG, C] Humans don\u2019t have 23 chromosome \npairs\nData\n[P \u2192 H, C] The chromosomes are pulled to the two pairs \nof chromosomes, that are identical\n[P \u2192 H, C] The chromosomes are a part of our body \ncells\nx\nz\nG\nrule\nG\ns2s\nD\n[P] Humans have 23 \nchromosome pairs \n[H] The chromosomes are a \npart of our body cells\nC\n\u03c1\nPPDB/WordNet\nSICK/Hand\nFigure 2: Overview of AdvEntuRe, our model for knowledge-guided textual entailment.\nAlgorithm 1 Training procedure for AdvEntuRe.\n1: pretrain discriminator D(\u02c6\u03b8) on X;\n2: pretrain generators Gs2s\nc (\u02c6\u03c6) on X;\n3: for number of training iterations do\n4:\nfor mini-batch B \u2190 X\ndo\n5:\ngenerate examples from G\n6:\nZG\u21d0G(B; \u03c6),\n7:\nbalance X and ZG s.t. |ZG| \u2264 \u03b1|X|\n8:\noptimize discriminator:\n9:\n\u02c6\u03b8 = argmin\u03b8 LD(X + ZG; \u03b8)\n10:\noptimize generator:\n11:\n\u02c6\u03c6 = argmin\u03c6 LGs2s(ZG; LD; \u03c6)\n12:\nUpdate \u03b8 \u2190 \u02c6\u03b8; \u03c6 \u2190 \u02c6\u03c6\ndata from the generator and better example generation against the learned discriminator. Algorithm 1 shows our training procedure.\nFirst, we pre-train the discriminator D and the\nseq2seq generators Gs2s on the original data X. We\nalternate the training of the discriminator and generators over K iterations (set to 30 in our experiments).\nFor each iteration, we take a mini-batch B from\nour original data X. For each mini-batch, we generate new entailment examples, ZG using our adversarial examples generator. Once we collect all\nthe generated examples, we balance the examples\nbased on their source and label (as described in\nSection 3.5). In each training iteration, we optimize the discriminator against the augmented\ntraining data, X+ZG and use the discriminator loss\nto guide the generator to pick challenging examples. For every mini-batch of examples X+ZG, we\ncompute the discriminator loss L(C; D(X + ZG; \u03b8))\nand apply the negative of this loss to each word of\nthe generated sentence in Gs2s. In other words, the\ndiscriminator loss value replaces the cross-entropy\nloss used to train the seq2seq model (similar to a\nREINFORCE (Williams, 1992) reward). This basic approach uses the loss over the entire batch to\nupdate the generator, ignoring whether specific examples were hard or easy for the discriminator. Instead, one could update the generator per example\nbased on the discriminator\u2019s loss on that example.\nWe leave this for future work.\n5\nExperiments\nOur empirical assessment focuses on two key\nquestions: (a) Can a handful of rule templates improve a state-of-the-art entailment system, especially with moderate amounts of training data? (b)\nCan iterative GAN-style training lead to an improved discriminator?\nTo this end, we assess various models on the\ntwo entailment datasets mentioned earlier: SNLI\n(570K examples) and SciTail (27K examples).5 To\ntest our hypothesis that adversarial example based\ntraining prevents overfitting in small to moderate\ntraining data regimes, we compare model accuracies on the test sets when using 1%, 10%, 50%,\nand 100% subsamples of the train and dev sets.\nWe consider two baseline models: D, the Decomposable Attention model (Parikh et al., 2016)\nwith intra-sentence attention using pre-trained\nword embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014); and\nDretro which extends D with word embeddings\ninitialized by retrofitted vectors (Faruqui et al.,\n2015). The vectors are retrofitted on PPDB, WordNet, FrameNet, and all of these, with the best results for each dataset reported here.\n5SNLI has a 96.4%/1.7%/1.7% split and SciTail has a\n87.3%/4.8%/7.8% split on train, valid, and test sets, resp.\n\fTable 4:\nTest accuracies with different subsampling ratios on SNLI (top) and SciTail (bottom).\nSNLI\n1%\n10%\n50%\n100%\nD\n57.68\n75.03\n82.77\n84.52\nDretro\n57.04\n73.45\n81.18\n84.14\nAdvEntuRe\n\u231e D + Gs2s\n58.35\n75.66\n82.91\n84.68\n\u231e D + Grule\n60.45\n77.11\n83.51\n84.40\n\u231e D + Grule + Gs2s\n59.33\n76.03\n83.02\n83.25\nSciTail\n1%\n10%\n50%\n100%\nD\n56.60\n60.84\n73.24\n74.29\nDretro\n59.75\n67.99\n69.05\n72.63\nAdvEntuRe\n\u231e D + Gs2s\n65.78\n70.77\n74.68\n76.92\n\u231e D + Grule\n61.74\n66.53\n73.99\n79.03\n\u231e D + Grule + Gs2s\n63.28\n66.78\n74.77\n78.60\nOur proposed model, AdvEntuRe, is evaluated\nin three flavors: D augmented with examples generated by Grule, Gs2s, or both, where Grule = GKB\u222a\nGH. In the first two cases, we create new examples\nfor each batch in every epoch using a fixed generator (cf. Section 3.5). In the third case (D + Grule\n+ Gs2s), we use the GAN-style training.\nWe uses grid search to find the best hyperparameters for D based on the validation set: hidden size 200 for LSTM layer, embedding size 300,\ndropout ratio 0.2, and fine-tuned embeddings.\nThe ratio between the number of generated vs.\noriginal examples, \u03b1 is empirically chosen to be\n1.0 for SNLI and 0.5 for SciTail, based on validation set performance. Generally, very few generated examples (small \u03b1) has little impact, while\ntoo many of them overwhelm the original dataset\nresulting in worse scores (cf. Appendix for more\ndetails).\n5.1\nMain Results\nTable 4 summarizes the test set accuracies of the\ndifferent models using various subsampling ratios\nfor SNLI and SciTail training data.\nWe make a few observations. First, Dretro is ineffective or even detrimental in most cases, except\non SciTail when 1% (235 examples) or 10% (2.3K\nexamples) of the training data is used. The gain in\nthese two cases is likely because retrofitted lexical\nrules are helpful with extremely less data training\nwhile not as data size increases.\nOn the other hand, our method always achieves\nthe best result compared to the baselines (D and\nDretro). Especially, significant improvements are\nTable 5:\nTest accuracies across various rules R\nand classes C. Since SciTail has two classes, we\nonly report results on two classes of Gs2s\nR/C\nSNLI (5%)\nSciTail (10%)\nD +Grule\nD\n69.18\n60.84\n+ PPDB\n72.81 (+3.6%)\n65.52 (+4.6%)\n+ SICK\n71.32 (+2.1%)\n67.49 (+6.5%)\n+ WordNet\n71.54 (+2.3%)\n64.67 (+3.8%)\n+ HAND\n71.15 (+1.9%)\n69.05 (+8.2%)\n+ all\n71.31 (+2.1%)\n64.16 (+3.3%)\nD +Gs2s\nD\n69.18\n60.84\n+ positive\n71.21 (+2.0%)\n67.49 (+6.6%)\n+ negative\n71.76 (+2.6%)\n68.95 (+8.1%)\n+ neutral\n71.72 (+2.5%)\n-+ all\n72.28 (+3.1%)\n70.77 (+9.9%)\nmade in less data setting: +2.77% in SNLI (1%)\nand 9.18% in SciTail (1%). Moreover, D + Grule\u2019s\naccuracy on SciTail (100%) also outperforms\nthe previous state-of-the-art model (DGEM (Khot\net al., 2018), which achieves 77.3%) for that\ndataset by 1.7%.\nAmong the three different generators combined\nwith D, both Grule and Gs2s are useful in SciTail, while Grule is much more useful than Gs2s on\nSNLI. We hypothesize that seq2seq model trained\non large training sets such as SNLI will be able\nto reproduce the input sentences. Adversarial examples from such a model are not useful since\nthe entailment model uses the same training examples. However, on smaller sets, the seq2seq model\nwould introduce noise that can improve the robustness of the model.\n5.2\nAblation Study\nTo evaluate the impact of each generator, we perform ablation tests against each symbolic generator in D + Grule and the generator Gs2s\nc\nfor each\nentailment class c. We use a 5% sample of SNLI\nand a 10% sample of SciTail. The results are summarized in Table 5.\nInterestingly,\nwhile\nPPDB\n(phrasal\nparaphrases) helps the most (+3.6%) on SNLI, simple\nnegation rules help significantly (+8.2%) on SciTail dataset. Since most entailment examples in\nSNLI are minor rewrites by Turkers, PPDB often\ncontains these simple paraphrases. For SciTail, the\nsentences are authored independently with limited gains from simple paraphrasing. However, a\nmodel trained on only 10% of the dataset (2.3K\nexamples) would end up learning a model relying\non purely word overlap. We believe that the sim-\n\fTable 6: Given a premise P (underlined), examples of hypothesis sentences H\u2019 generated by seq2seq\ngenerators Gs2s, and premise sentences P\u2019 generated by rule based generators Grule, on the full SNLI\ndata. Replaced words or phrases are shown in bold. This illustrates that even simple, easy-to-define\nrules can generate useful adversarial examples.\nP\na person on a horse jumps over a broken down airplane\nH\u2019: Gs2s\nc=\u2291\na person is on a horse jumps over a rail, a person jumping over a plane\nH\u2019: Gs2s\nc=\u22cf\na person is riding a horse in a field with a dog in a red coat\nH\u2019: Gs2s\nc=#\na person is in a blue dog is in a park\nP (or H)\na dirt bike rider catches some air going off a large hill\nP\u2019: GKB(PPDB)\n\u03c1=\u2261,g\u03c1=\u2291\na dirt motorcycle rider catches some air going off a large hill\nP\u2019: GKB(SICK)\n\u03c1=c,g\u03c1=#\na dirt bike man on yellow bike catches some air going off a large hill\nP\u2019: GKB(WordNet)\n\u03c1=syno,g\u03c1=\u2291\na dirt bike rider catches some atmosphere going off a large hill\nP\u2019: GHand\n\u03c1=neg,g\u03c1=\u22cf\na dirt bike rider do not catch some air going off a large hill\nple negation examples introduce neutral examples\nwith high lexical overlap, forcing the model to find\na more informative signal.\nOn the other hand, using all classes for Gs2s results in the best performance, supporting the effectiveness of the GAN framework for penalizing or rewarding generated sentences based on\nD\u2019s loss. Preferential selection of rules within the\nGAN framework remains a promising direction.\n5.3\nQualitative Results\nTable 6 shows examples generated by various\nmethods in AdvEntuRe. As shown, both seq2seq\nand rule based generators produce reasonable sentences according to classes and rules.\nAs expected, seq2seq models trained on very few examples generate noisy sentences. The quality of our\nknowledge-guided generators, on the other hand,\ndoes not depend on the training set size and they\nstill produce reliable sentences.\n5.4\nCase Study: Negation\nFor further analysis of the negation-based generator in Table 1, we collect only the negation examples in test set of SNLI, henceforth referred to\nas nega-SNLI. Specifically, we extract examples\nwhere either the premise or the hypothesis contains \u201cnot\u201d, \u201cno\u201d, \u201cnever\u201d, or a word that ends with\n\u201cn\u2019t\u2019. These do not cover more subtle ways of expressing negation such as \u201cseldom\u201d and the use of\nantonyms. nega-SNLI contains 201 examples with\nthe following label distribution: 51 (25.4%) neutral, 42 (20.9%) entails, 108 (53.7%) contradicts.\nTable 7 shows examples in each category.\nTable 7: Negation examples in nega-SNLI\n\u2291\nP: several women are playing volleyball.\nH: this doesn\u2019t look like soccer.\n#\nP: a man with no shirt on is performing\nwith a baton.\nH: a man is trying his best at the national\nchampionship of baton.\n\u22cf\nP: island native fishermen reeling in their\nnets after a long day\u2019s work.\nH: the men did not go to work today but\ninstead played bridge.\nWhile D achieves an accuracy of only 76.64%6\non nega-SNLI, D + GH with negate is substantially more successful (+6.1%) at handling negation, achieving an accuracy of 82.74%.\n6\nConclusion\nWe introduced an adversarial training architecture for textual entailment.\nOur seq2seq and\nknowledge-guided example generators, trained in\nan end-to-end fashion, can be used to make any\nbase entailment model more robust.\nThe effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by the\nsignificant improvement it achieves on both SNLI\nand SciTail, especially in the low to medium data\nregimes.\nOur rule-based generators can be expanded to cover more patterns and phenomena,\nand the seq2seq generator extended to incorporate\nper-example loss for adversarial training.\n6This is much less than the full test accuracy of 84.52%.\n\fReferences\nGabor Angeli and Christopher D Manning. 2014.

First, we propose knowledge-guided adversarial example generators for incorporating large lexical resources in entailment models via only a handful of rule templates. Second, to make the entailment model--a discriminator--more robust, we propose the first GAN-style approach for training it using a natural language example generator that iteratively adjusts based on the discriminator's performance. We demonstrate effectiveness using two entailment datasets, where the proposed methods increase accuracy by 4.7% on SciTail and by 2.8% on a 1% training sub-sample of SNLI. Notably, even a single hand-written rule, negate, improves the accuracy on the negation examples in SNLI by 6.1%.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nThe impressive success of machine learning models on large natural language datasets often does not carry over to moderate training data regimes, where models often struggle with infrequently observed patterns and simple adversarial variations. A prominent example of this phenomenon is _textual entailment_, the fundamental task of deciding whether a _premise_ text entails (\\(\\vDash\\)) a _hypothesis_ text. On certain datasets, recent deep learning entailment systems (Parikh et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017; Gong et al., 2018) have achieved close to human level performance. Nevertheless, the problem is far from solved, as evidenced by how easy it is to generate minor adversarial examples that break even the best systems. As Table 1 illustrates, a state-of-the-art neural system for this task, namely the Decomposable Attention Model (Parikh et al., 2016), fails when faced with simple linguistic phenomena such as negation, or a re-ordering of words. This is not unique to a particular model or task. Minor adversarial examples have also been found to easily break neural systems on other linguistic tasks such as reading comprehension (Jia and Liang, 2017).\n\nA key contributor to this brittleness is the use of specific datasets such as SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015) and SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) to drive model development. While large and challenging, _these datasets also tend to be homogeneous_. E.g., SNLI was created by asking crowd-source workers to generate entailing sentences, which then tend to have limited linguistic variations and annotation artifacts (Gururangan et al., 2018). Consequently, models overfit to sufficiently repetitive patterns--and sometimes idiosyncrasies--in the datasets they are trained on. They fail to cover long-tail and rare patterns in the training distribution, or linguistic phenomena such as negation that would be obvious to a layperson.\n\nTo address this challenge, we propose to _train textual entailment models more robustly using ad\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l} \\hline \\hline\n**P**: The dog did not eat all of the chickens. \\\\\n**H**: The dog ate all of the chickens. \\\\\n**S**: entails (score 56.5\\%) \\\\ \\hline\n**P**: The red box is in the blue box. \\\\\n**H**: The blue box is in the red box. \\\\\n**S**: entails (score 92.1\\%) \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: Failure examples from the SNLI dataset: negation (Top) and re-ordering (Bottom). **P** is premise, **H** is hypothesis, and **S** is prediction made by an entailment system (Parikh et al., 2016).\n\n_versarial examples_ generated in two ways: (a) by incorporating knowledge from large linguistic resources, and (b) using a sequence-to-sequence neural model in a GAN-style framework.\n\nThe motivation stems from the following observation. While deep-learning based textual entailment models lead the pack, they generally do not incorporate intuitive rules such as negation, and ignore large-scale linguistic resources such as PPDB Ganitkevitch et al. (2013) and WordNet Miller (1995). These resources could help them generalize beyond specific words observed during training. For instance, while the SNLI dataset contains the pattern _two men_\\(\\vDash\\)_people_, it does not contain the analogous pattern _two dogs_\\(\\vDash\\)_animals_ found easily in WordNet.\n\nEffectively integrating simple rules or linguistic resources in a deep learning model, however, is challenging. Doing so directly by substantially adapting the model architecture Sha et al. (2016); Chen et al. (2018) can be cumbersome and limiting. Incorporating such knowledge indirectly via modified word embeddings Faruqui et al. (2015); Mrksic et al. (2016), as we show, can have little positive impact and can even be detrimental.\n\nOur proposed method, which is task-specific but model-independent, is inspired by data-augmentation techniques. We generate new training examples by applying knowledge-guided rules, via only a handful of rule templates, to the original training examples. Simultaneously, we also use a sequence-to-sequence or seq2seq model for each entailment class to generate new hypotheses from a given premise, adaptively creating new adversarial examples. These can be used with any entailment model without constraining model architecture.\n\nWe also introduce the first approach to train a robust entailment model using a Generative Adversarial Network or GAN Goodfellow et al. (2014) style framework. We iteratively improve both the entailment system (the _discriminator_) and the differentiable part of the data-augmenter (specifically the neural _generator_), by training the generator based on the discriminator's performance on the generated examples. Importantly, unlike the typical use of GANs to create a strong generator, we use it as a mechanism to create a strong and robust discriminator.\n\nOur new entailment system, called AdvEntuRe, demonstrates that in the moderate data regime, adversarial iterative data-augmentation via only a handful of linguistic rule templates can be surprisingly powerful. Specifically, we observe 4.7% accuracy improvement on the challenging SciTail dataset Khot et al. (2018) and a 2.8% improvement on 10K-50K training subsets of SNLI. An evaluation of our algorithm on the negation examples in the test set of SNLI reveals a 6.1% improvement from just a single rule.\n\n## 2 Related Work\n\nAdversarial example generation has recently received much attention in NLP. For example, Jia and Liang (2017) generate adversarial examples using manually defined templates for the SQuAD reading comprehension task. Glockner et al. (2018) create an adversarial dataset from SNLI by using WordNet knowledge. Automatic methods Iyyer et al. (2018) have also been proposed to generate adversarial examples through paraphrasing. These works reveal how neural network systems trained on a large corpus can easily break when faced with carefully designed unseen adversarial patterns at test time. Our motivation is different. We use adversarial examples at training time, in a data augmentation setting, to train a more robust entailment discriminator. The generator uses explicit knowledge or hand written rules, and is trained in a end-to-end fashion along with the discriminator.\n\nIncorporating external rules or linguistic resources in a deep learning model generally requires substantially adapting the model architecture Sha et al. (2016); Liang et al. (2017); Kang et al. (2017). This is a model-dependent approach, which can be cumbersome and constraining. Similarly non-neural textual entailment models have been developed that incorporate knowledge bases. However, these also require model-specific engineering Raina et al. (2005); Haghighi et al. (2005); Silva et al. (2018).\n\nAn alternative is the model- and task-independent route of incorporating linguistic resources via word embeddings that are _retro-fitted_Faruqui et al. (2015) or _counter-fitted_Mrksic et al. (2016) to such resources. We demonstrate, however, that this has little positive impact in our setting and can even be detrimental. Further, it is unclear how to incorporate knowledge sources into advanced representations such as contextual embeddings McCann et al. (2017; Peters et al., 2018). We thus focus on a task-specific but model-independent approach.\n\nLogical rules have also been defined to label existing examples based on external resources (Hu et al., 2016). Our focus here is on generating _new_ training examples.\n\nOur use of the GAN framework to create a better discriminator is related to CatGANs (Wang and Zhang, 2017) and TripleGANs (Chongxuan et al., 2017) where the discriminator is trained to classify the original training image classes as well as a new 'fake' image class. We, on the other hand, generate examples belonging to the same classes as the training examples. Further, unlike the earlier focus on the vision domain, this is the first approach to train a discriminator using GANs for a natural language task with discrete outputs.\n\n## 3 Adversarial Example Generation\n\nWe present three different techniques to create adversarial examples for textual entailment. Specifically, we show how external knowledge resources, hand-authored rules, and neural language generation models can be used to generate such examples. Before describing these generators in detail, we introduce the notation used henceforth.\n\nWe use lower-case letters for single instances (e.g., \\(x,p,h\\)), upper-case letters for sets of instances (e.g., \\(X,P,H\\)), blackboard bold for models (e.g., \\(\\mathbb{D}\\)), and calligraphic symbols for discrete spaces of possible values (e.g., class labels \\(\\mathcal{C}\\)). For the textual entailment task, we assume each example is represented as a triple (\\(p\\), \\(h\\), \\(c\\)), where \\(p\\) is a premise (a natural language sentence), \\(h\\) is a hypothesis, and \\(c\\) is an entailment label: (a) _entails_ (\\(\\boxdot\\)) if \\(h\\) is true whenever \\(p\\) is true; (b) _contradicts_ (\\(\\curlywedge\\)) if \\(h\\) is false whenever \\(p\\) is true; or (c) _neutral_ (\\(\\#\\)) if the truth value of \\(h\\) cannot be concluded from \\(p\\) being true.1\n\nFootnote 1: The symbols are based on Natural Logic (Lakoff, 1970) and use the notation of MacCartney and Manning (2012).\n\nWe will introduce various example generators in the rest of this section. Each such generator, \\(\\mathbb{G}_{\\rho}\\), is defined by a partial function \\(f_{\\rho}\\) and a label \\(g_{\\rho}\\). If a sentence \\(s\\) has a certain property required by \\(f_{\\rho}\\) (e.g., contains a particular string), \\(f_{\\rho}\\) transforms it into another sentence \\(s^{\\prime}\\) and \\(g_{\\rho}\\) provides an entailment label from \\(s\\) to \\(s^{\\prime}\\). Applied to a sentence \\(s\\), \\(\\mathbb{G}_{\\rho}\\) thus either \"fails\" (if the pre-requisite isn't met) or generates a new entailment example triple, \\(\\left(s,f_{\\rho}(s),g_{\\rho}\\right)\\). For instance, consider the generator for \\(\\rho\\):=hypernym(car, vehicle) with the (partial) transformation function \\(f_{\\rho}\\):=\"Replace _car_ with _vehicle_\" and the label \\(g_{\\rho}\\):=_entails_. \\(f_{\\rho}\\) would fail when applied to a sentence not containing the word \"car\". Applying \\(f_{\\rho}\\) to the sentence s=\"\\(A\\)_man is driving the car_\" would generate s'=\"\\(A\\)_man is driving the vehicle_\", creating the example \\((s,s^{\\prime},\\emph{entails})\\).\n\nThe seven generators we use for experimentation are summarized in Table 2 and discussed in more detail subsequently. While these particular generators are simplistic and one can easily imagine more advanced ones, we show that training using adversarial examples created using even these simple generators leads to substantial accuracy improvement on two datasets.\n\n### Knowledge-Guided Generators\n\nLarge knowledge-bases such as WordNet and PPDB contain lexical equivalences and other relationships highly relevant for entailment models. However, even large datasets such as SNLI generally do not contain most of these relationships in the training data. E.g., that _two dogs_ entails _animals_ isn't captured in the SNLI data. We define simple generators based on lexical resources to create adversarial examples that capture the underlying knowledge. This allows models trained on these examples to learn these relationships.\n\nAs discussed earlier, there are different ways of incorporating such symbolic knowledge into neural models. Unlike task-agnostic ways of approaching this goal from a word embedding perspective (Faruqui et al., 2015; Mrksic et al., 2016)\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c} \\hline\n**Source** & \\(\\rho\\) & \\(f_{\\rho}\\)(s) & \\(g_{\\rho}\\) \\\\ \\hline \\multicolumn{4}{c}{Knowledge Base, \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{KB}}\\)} \\\\ \\multirow{3}{*}{WordNet} & \\(\\text{hyper}(x,y)\\) & & \\(\\boxdot\\) \\\\  & \\(\\text{anto}(x,y)\\) & & \\(\\curlywedge\\) \\\\  & \\(\\text{syno}(x,y)\\) & \n\\begin{tabular}{c} Replace \\(x\\) \\\\ with \\(y\\) in \\(s\\) \\\\ \\end{tabular} & \\(\\boxdot\\) \\\\ \\hline PPDB & \\(x\\equiv y\\) & & \\(\\boxdot\\) \\\\ \\hline SICK & \\(c(x,y)\\) & & \\(c\\) \\\\ \\hline \\multicolumn{4}{c}{Hand-authored, \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{H}}\\)} \\\\ \\multirow{2}{*}{Domain knowledge} & neg & negate(\\(s\\)) & \\(\\curlywedge\\) \\\\ \\multicolumn{4}{c}{Neural Model, \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{2s}}\\)} \\\\ \\multirow{2}{*}{Training data} & (s2s, \\(c\\)) & \\(\\mathbb{G}_{c}^{\\text{2s}}(s)\\) & \\(c\\) \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 2: Various generators \\(\\mathbb{G}_{\\rho}\\) characterized by their source, (partial) transformation function \\(f_{\\rho}\\) as applied to a sentence \\(s\\), and entailment label \\(g_{\\rho}\\)or the model-specific approach (Sha et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2018), we use this knowledge to generate task-specific examples. This allows any entailment model to learn how to use these relationships _in the context of the entailment task_, helping them outperform the above task-agnostic alternative.\n\nOur knowledge-guided example generators, \\(\\mathbb{G}_{\\rho}^{\\text{KB}}\\), use lexical relations available in a knowledge-base: \\(\\rho:=r(x,y)\\) where the relation \\(r\\) (such as synonym, hypernym, etc.) may differ across knowledge bases. We use a simple (partial) transformation function, \\(f_{\\rho}(s)\\):=\"Replace \\(x\\) in \\(s\\) with \\(y\\)\", as described in an earlier example. In some cases, when part-of-speech (POS) tags are available, the partial function requires the tags for \\(x\\) in \\(s\\) and in \\(r(x,y)\\) to match. The entailment label \\(g_{\\rho}\\) for the resulting examples is also defined based on the relation \\(r\\), as summarized in Table 2.\n\nThis idea is similar to Natural Logic Inference or NLI (Lakoff, 1970; Sommers, 1982; Angeli and Manning, 2014) where words in a sentence can be replaced by their hypernym/hyponym to produce entailing/neutral sentences, depending on their context. We propose a context-agnostic use of lexical resources that, despite its simplicity, already results in significant gains. We use three sources for generators:\n\nWordNet (Miller, 1995) is a large, hand-curated, semantic lexicon with synonymous words grouped into _synsets_. Synsets are connected by many semantic relations, from which we use _hyponym_ and _synonym_ relations to generate entailing sentences, and _antonym_ relations to generate contradicting sentences2. Given a relation \\(r(x,y)\\), the (partial) transformation function \\(f_{\\rho}\\) is the POS-tag matched replacement of \\(x\\) in \\(s\\) with \\(y\\), and requires the POS tag to be noun or verb. NLI provides a more robust way of using these relations based on context, which we leave for future work.\n\nFootnote 2: A similar approach was used in a parallel work to generate an adversarial dataset from SNLI (Glockner et al., 2018).\n\nPPDB(Ganitkevitch et al., 2013) is a large resource of lexical, phrasal, and syntactic paraphrases. We use 24,273 lexical paraphrases in their smallest set, PPDB-S (Pavlick et al., 2015), as equivalence relations, \\(x\\equiv y\\). The (partial) transformation function \\(f_{\\rho}\\) for this generator is POS-tagged matched replacement of \\(x\\) in \\(s\\) with \\(y\\), and the label \\(g_{\\rho}\\) is _entails_.\n\nSick(Marelli et al., 2014) is dataset with entailment examples of the form \\((p,h,c)\\), created to evaluate an entailment model's ability to capture compositional knowledge via hand-authored rules. We use the 12,508 patterns of the form \\(c(x,y)\\) extracted by Beltagy et al. Beltagy et al. (2016) by comparing sentences in this dataset, with the property that for each SICK example \\((p,h,c)\\), replacing (when applicable) \\(x\\) with \\(y\\) in \\(p\\) produces \\(h\\). For simplicity, we ignore positional information in these patterns. The (partial) transformation function \\(f_{\\rho}\\) is replacement of \\(x\\) in \\(s\\) with \\(y\\), and the label \\(g_{\\rho}\\) is \\(c\\).\n\n### Hand-Defined Generators\n\nEven very large entailment datasets have no or very few examples of certain otherwise common linguistic constructs such as negation,3 causing models trained on them to struggle with these constructs. A simple model-agnostic way to alleviate this issue is via a negation example generator whose transformation function \\(f_{\\rho}(s)\\) is negate(\\(s\\)), described below, and the label \\(g_{\\rho}\\) is _contradicts_.\n\nFootnote 3: Only 211 examples (2.11%) in the SNLI training set contain negation triggers such as not, \u201drt, etc.\n\nnegate(s): If \\(s\\) contains a 'be' verb (e.g., is, was), add a \"not\" after the verb. If not, also add a \"did\" or \"do\" in front based on its tense. E.g., change \"A person is crossing\" to \"A person is not crossing\" and \"A person crossed\" to \"A person did not cross.\" While many other rules could be added, we found that this single rule covered a majority of the cases. Verb tenses are also considered4 and changed accordingly. Other functions such as dropping adverbial clauses or changing tenses could be defined in a similar manner.\n\nFootnote 4: [https://www.nodebox.net/code/index.php/Linguistics](https://www.nodebox.net/code/index.php/Linguistics)\n\nBoth the knowledge-guided and hand-defined generators make local changes to the sentences based on simple rules. It should be possible to extend the hand-defined rules to cover the long tail (as long as they are procedurally definable). However, a more scalable approach would be to extend our generators to trainable models that can cover a wider range of phenomena than hand-defined rules. Moreover, the applicability of these rules generally depends on the context which can also be incorporated in such trainable generators.\n\n### Neural Generators\n\nFor each entailment class \\(c\\), we use a trainable sequence-to-sequence neural model (Sutskeveret al., 2014; Luong et al., 2015) to generate an entailment example (\\(s,s^{\\prime},c\\)) from an input sentence \\(s\\). The seq2seq model, trained on examples labeled \\(c\\), itself acts as the transformation function \\(f_{\\rho}\\) of the corresponding generator \\(\\mathbb{G}_{c}^{\\text{s2s}}\\). The label \\(g_{\\rho}\\) is set to \\(c\\). The joint probability of seq2seq model is:\n\n\\[\\mathbb{G}_{c}^{\\text{s2s}}(X_{c};\\phi_{c}) =\\mathbb{G}_{c}^{\\text{s2s}}(H_{c},P_{c};\\phi_{c}) \\tag{1}\\] \\[=\\Pi_{i}P(h_{i,c}|p_{i,c};\\phi_{c})P(h_{i}) \\tag{2}\\]\n\nThe loss function for training the seq2seq is:\n\n\\[\\hat{\\phi}_{c}=\\operatorname*{argmin}_{\\phi_{c}}L(H_{c},\\mathbb{G}_{c}^{\\text{ s2s}}(X_{c};\\phi_{c})) \\tag{3}\\]\n\nwhere \\(L\\) is the cross-entropy loss between the original hypothesis \\(H_{c}\\) and the predicted hypothesis. Cross-entropy is computed for each predicted word \\(w_{i}\\) against the same in \\(H_{c}\\) given the sequence of previous words in \\(H_{c}\\). \\(\\hat{\\phi}_{c}\\) are the optimal parameters in \\(\\mathbb{G}_{c}^{\\text{s2s}}\\) that minimize the loss for class \\(c\\). We use the single most likely output to generate sentences in order to reduce decoding time.\n\n### Example Generation\n\nThe generators described above are used to create new entailment examples from the training data. For each example (\\(p,h,c\\)) in the data, we can create two new examples: \\(\\left(p,f_{\\rho}(p),g_{\\rho}\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(h,f_{\\rho}(h),g_{\\rho}\\right)\\).\n\nThe examples generated this way using \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{KB}}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{H}}\\) can, however, be relatively easy, as the premise and hypothesis would differ by only a word or so. We therefore compose such simple (\"first-order\") generated examples with the original input example to create more challenging \"second-order\" examples. We can create second-order examples by composing the original example (\\(p,h,c\\)) with a generated sentence from hypothesis, \\(f_{\\rho}(h)\\) and premise, \\(f_{\\rho}(p)\\). Figure 1 depicts how these two kinds of examples are generated from an input example (\\(p,h,c\\)).\n\nFirst, we consider the second-order example between the original premise and the transformed hypothesis: \\((p,f_{\\rho}(h),\\bigoplus(c,g_{\\rho}))\\), where \\(\\bigoplus\\), defined in the left half of Table 3, composes the input example label \\(c\\) (connecting \\(p\\) and \\(h\\)) and the generated example label \\(g_{\\rho}\\) to produce a new label. For instance, if \\(p\\) entails \\(h\\) and \\(h\\) entails \\(f_{\\rho}(h)\\), \\(p\\) would entail \\(f_{\\rho}\\). In other words, \\(\\bigoplus(\\sqsubseteq,\\sqsubseteq)\\) is \\(\\sqsubseteq\\). For example, composing (\"A man is playing soccer\", \"A man is playing a game\", \\(\\sqsubseteq\\)) with a generated hypothesis \\(f_{\\rho}(h)\\): \"A person is playing a game.\" will give a new second-order entailment example: (\"A man is playing soccer\", \"A person is playing a game\", \\(\\sqsubseteq\\)).\n\nSecond, we create an example from the generated premise to the original hypothesis: \\((f_{\\rho}(p),h,\\bigotimes(g_{\\rho},c))\\). The composition function here, denoted \\(\\bigotimes\\) and defined in the right half of Table 3, is often undetermined. For example, if \\(p\\) entails \\(f_{\\rho}(p)\\) and \\(p\\) entails \\(h\\), the relation between \\(f_{\\rho}(p)\\) and \\(h\\) is undetermined i.e. \\(\\bigotimes(\\sqsubseteq,\\sqsubseteq)\\) =?. While this particular composition \\(\\bigotimes\\) often leads to undetermined or neutral relations, we use it here for completeness. For example, composing the previous example with a generated _neutral_ premise, \\(f_{\\rho}(p)\\): \"A person is wearing a cap\" would generate an example (\"A person is wearing a cap\", \"A man is playing a game\", #)\n\nThe composition function \\(\\bigoplus\\) is the same as the \"join\" operation in natural logic reasoning (Icard III and Moss, 2014), except for two differences: (a) relations that do not belong to our three entailment classes are mapped to '?', and\n\nFigure 1: Generating first-order (blue) and second-order (red) examples.\n\n(b) the exclusivity/alternation relation is mapped to _contradicts_. The composition function \\(\\bigotimes\\), on the other hand, does not map to the join operation.\n\n### Implementation Details\n\nGiven the original training examples X, we generate the examples from each premise and hypothesis in a batch using \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{KB}}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{H}}\\). We also generate new hypothesis per class for each premise using \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{s2s}}_{c}\\). Using all the generated examples to train the model would, however, overwhelm the original training set. For examples, our knowledge-guided generators \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{KB}}\\) can be applied in 17,258,314 different ways.\n\nTo avoid this, we sub-sample our synthetic examples to ensure that they are proportional to the input examples \\(X\\), specifically they are bounded to \\(\\alpha|X|\\) where \\(\\alpha\\) is tuned for each dataset. Also, as seen in Table 3, our knowledge-guided generators are more likely to generate _neutral_ examples than any other class. To make sure that the labels are not skewed, we also sub-sample the examples to ensure that our generated examples have the same class distribution as the input batch. The SciTail dataset only contains two classes: _entails_ mapped to \\(\\sqsubseteq\\) and _neutral_ mapped to \\(\\curlywedge\\). As a result, generated examples that do not belong to these two classes are ignored.\n\nThe sub-sampling, however, has a negative side-effect where our generated examples end up using a small number of lexical relations from the large knowledge bases. On moderate datasets, this would cause the entailment model to potentially just memorize these few lexical relations. Hence, we generate new entailment examples for each mini-batch and update the model parameters based on the training+generated examples in this batch.\n\nThe overall example generation procedure goes as follows: For each mini-batch \\(X\\) (1) randomly choose 3 applicable rules per source and sentence (e.g., replacing men with people based on PPDB in premise is one rule), (2) produce examples \\(Z_{all}\\) using \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{KB}}\\), \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{H}}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{s2s}}\\), (3) randomly sub-select examples \\(Z\\) from \\(Z_{all}\\) to ensure the balance between classes and \\(|Z|=\\alpha|X|\\).\n\n## 4 AdvEntuRe\n\nFigure 2 shows the complete architecture of our model, AdvEntuRe (ADVersarial training for textual ENTailment Using Rule-based Examples.). The entailment model \\(\\mathbb{D}\\) is shown with the white box and two proposed generators are shown using black boxes. We combine the two symbolic untrained generators, \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{KB}}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{H}}\\) into a single \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{rule}}\\) model. We combine the generated adversarial examples Z with the original training examples X to train the discriminator. Next, we describe how the individual models are trained and finally present our new approach to train the generator based on the discriminator's performance.\n\n### Discriminator Training\n\nWe use one of the state-of-the-art entailment models (at the time of its publication) on SNLI, decomposable attention model [10] with intra-sentence attention as our discriminator \\(\\mathbb{D}\\). The model attends each word in hypothesis with each word in the premise, compares each pair of the attentions, and then aggregates them as a final representation. This discriminator model can be easily replaced with any other entailment model without any other change to the AdvEntuRe architecture. We pre-train our discriminator \\(\\mathbb{D}\\) on the original dataset, X=(P, H, C) using:\n\n\\[\\mathbb{D}(X;\\theta) =\\operatorname*{argmax}_{\\mathcal{C}}\\mathbb{D}(\\hat{\\mathcal{C}} |P,H;\\theta) \\tag{4}\\] \\[\\hat{\\theta} =\\operatorname*{argmin}_{\\theta}L(C,\\mathbb{D}(X;\\theta)) \\tag{5}\\]\n\nwhere \\(L\\) is cross-entropy loss function between the true labels, \\(Y\\) and the predicted classes, and \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) are the learned parameters.\n\n### Generator Training\n\nOur knowledge-guided and hand-defined generators are symbolic parameter-less methods which are not currently trained. For simplicity, we will refer to the set of symbolic rule-based generators as \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{rule}}:=\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{KB}}\\cup\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{H}}\\). The neural generator \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{s2s}}\\), on the other hand, can be trained as described earlier. We leave the training of the symbolic models for future work.\n\n### Adversarial Training\n\nWe now present our approach to iteratively train the discriminator and generator in a GAN-style framework. Unlike traditional GAN [1] on image/text generation that aims to obtain better generators, our goal is to build a robust discriminator regularized by the generators (\\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{s2s}}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{rule}}\\)). The discriminator and generator are iteratively trained against each other to achieve better discrimination on the augmented data from the generator and better example generation against the learned discriminator. Algorithm 1 shows our training procedure.\n\nFirst, we pre-train the discriminator \\(\\mathbb{D}\\) and the seq2seq generators \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{s2s}}\\) on the original data \\(X\\). We alternate the training of the discriminator and generators over K iterations (set to 30 in our experiments).\n\nFor each iteration, we take a mini-batch \\(B\\) from our original data \\(X\\). For each mini-batch, we generate new entailment examples, \\(Z_{G}\\) using our adversarial examples generator. Once we collect all the generated examples, we balance the examples based on their source and label (as described in Section 3.5). In each training iteration, we optimize the discriminator against the augmented training data, \\(X+Z_{G}\\) and use the discriminator loss to guide the generator to pick challenging examples. For every mini-batch of examples \\(X+Z_{G}\\), we compute the discriminator loss \\(L(C;\\mathbb{D}(X+Z_{G};\\theta))\\) and apply the negative of this loss to each word of the generated sentence in \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{s2s}}\\). In other words, the discriminator loss value replaces the cross-entropy loss used to train the seq2seq model (similar to a REINFORCE (Williams, 1992) reward). This basic approach uses the loss over the entire batch to update the generator, ignoring whether specific examples were hard or easy for the discriminator. Instead, one could update the generator per example based on the discriminator's loss on that example. We leave this for future work.\n\n## 5 Experiments\n\nOur empirical assessment focuses on two key questions: (a) Can a handful of rule templates improve a state-of-the-art entailment system, especially with moderate amounts of training data? (b) Can iterative GAN-style training lead to an improved discriminator?\n\nTo this end, we assess various models on the two entailment **datasets** mentioned earlier: SNLI (570K examples) and SciTail (27K examples).5 To test our hypothesis that adversarial example based training prevents overfitting in small to moderate training data regimes, we compare model accuracies on the test sets when using 1%, 10%, 50%, and 100% subsamples of the train and dev sets.\n\nFootnote 5: SNLI has a 96.4%/1.7%/1.7% split and SciTail has a 87.3%/4.8%/7.8% split on train, valid, and test sets, resp.\n\nWe consider two baseline **models**: \\(\\mathbb{D}\\), the Decomposable Attention model (Parikh et al., 2016) with intra-sentence attention using pre-trained word embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014); and \\(\\mathbb{D}_{\\text{retro}}\\) which extends \\(\\mathbb{D}\\) with word embeddings initialized by retrofitted vectors (Faruqui et al., 2015). The vectors are retrofitted on PPDB, WordNet, FrameNet, and all of these, with the best results for each dataset reported here.\n\nFigure 2: Overview of AdvEntuRe, our model for knowledge-guided textual entailment.\n\nOur proposed model, AdvEntuRe, is evaluated in three flavors: \\(\\mathbb{D}\\) augmented with examples generated by \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{rule}}\\), \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{s2s}}\\), or both, where \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{rule}}=\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{KB}}\\cup\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{H}}\\). In the first two cases, we create new examples for each batch in every epoch using a fixed generator (cf. Section 3.5). In the third case (\\(\\mathbb{D}+\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{rule}}+\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{s2s}}\\)), we use the GAN-style training.\n\nWe uses grid search to find the best hyperparameters for \\(\\mathbb{D}\\) based on the validation set: hidden size 200 for LSTM layer, embedding size 300, dropout ratio 0.2, and fine-tuned embeddings.\n\nThe ratio between the number of generated vs. original examples, \\(\\alpha\\) is empirically chosen to be 1.0 for SNLI and 0.5 for SciTail, based on validation set performance. Generally, very few generated examples (small \\(\\alpha\\)) has little impact, while too many of them overwhelm the original dataset resulting in worse scores (cf. Appendix for more details).\n\n### Main Results\n\nTable 4 summarizes the test set accuracies of the different models using various subsampling ratios for SNLI and SciTail training data.\n\nWe make a few observations. First, \\(\\mathbb{D}_{\\text{retro}}\\) is ineffective or even detrimental in most cases, except on SciTail when 1% (235 examples) or 10% (2.3K examples) of the training data is used. The gain in these two cases is likely because retrofitted lexical rules are helpful with extremely less data training while not as data size increases.\n\nOn the other hand, our method always achieves the best result compared to the baselines (\\(\\mathbb{D}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{D}_{\\text{retro}}\\)). Especially, significant improvements are made in less data setting: +2.77% in SNLI (1%) and 9.18% in SciTail (1%). Moreover, \\(\\mathbb{D}+\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{rule}}\\)'s accuracy on SciTail (100%) also outperforms the previous state-of-the-art model (DGEM (Khot et al., 2018), which achieves 77.3%) for that dataset by 1.7%.\n\nAmong the three different generators combined with \\(\\mathbb{D}\\), both \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{rule}}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{s2s}}\\) are useful in SciTail, while \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{rule}}\\) is much more useful than \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{s2s}}\\) on SNLI. We hypothesize that seq2seq model trained on large training sets such as SNLI will be able to reproduce the input sentences. Adversarial examples from such a model are not useful since the entailment model uses the same training examples. However, on smaller sets, the seq2seq model would introduce noise that can improve the robustness of the model.\n\n### Ablation Study\n\nTo evaluate the impact of each generator, we perform ablation tests against each symbolic generator in \\(\\mathbb{D}+\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{rule}}\\) and the generator \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{s2s}}_{c}\\) for each entailment class \\(c\\). We use a 5% sample of SNLI and a 10% sample of SciTail. The results are summarized in Table 5.\n\nInterestingly, while PPDB (phrasal paraphrases) helps the most (**+3.6%**) on SNLI, simple negation rules help significantly (**+8.2%**) on SciTail dataset. Since most entailment examples in SNLI are minor rewrites by Turkers, PPDB often contains these simple paraphrases. For SciTail, the sentences are authored independently with limited gains from simple paraphrasing. However, a model trained on only 10% of the dataset (2.3K examples) would end up learning a model relying on purely word overlap. We believe that the sim\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l|c c c c}\n**SNLI** & 1\\% & 10\\% & 50\\% & 100\\% \\\\ \\hline \\(\\mathbb{D}\\) & 57.68 & 75.03 & 82.77 & 84.52 \\\\ \\(\\mathbb{D}_{\\text{retro}}\\) & 57.04 & 73.45 & 81.18 & 84.14 \\\\ AdvEntuRe & \\(\\mathbb{D}+\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{s2s}}\\) & 58.35 & 75.66 & 82.91 & **84.68** \\\\ \\(\\mathbb{L}\\)\\(\\mathbb{D}+\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{rule}}\\) & **60.45** & **77.11** & **83.51** & 84.40 \\\\ \\(\\mathbb{L}\\)\\(\\mathbb{D}+\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{rule}}+\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{s2s}}\\) & 59.33 & 76.03 & 83.02 & 83.25 \\\\ \\hline\n**SciTail** & 1\\% & 10\\% & 50\\% & 100\\% \\\\ \\hline \\(\\mathbb{D}\\) & 56.60 & 60.84 & 73.24 & 74.29 \\\\ \\(\\mathbb{D}_{\\text{retro}}\\) & 59.75 & 67.99 & 69.05 & 72.63 \\\\ AdvEntuRe & & & & \\\\ \\(\\mathbb{L}\\)\\(\\mathbb{D}+\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{s2s}}\\) & **65.78** & **70.77** & 74.68 & 76.92 \\\\ \\(\\mathbb{L}\\)\\(\\mathbb{D}+\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{rule}}\\) & 61.74 & 66.53 & 73.99 & **79.03** \\\\ \\(\\mathbb{L}\\)\\(\\mathbb{D}+\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{rule}}+\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{s2s}}\\) & 63.28 & 66.78 & **74.77** & 78.60 \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 4: Test accuracies with different subsampling ratios on SNLI (top) and SciTail (bottom).\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l|l|l|l}  & \\(\\mathcal{R}\\)/\\(\\mathcal{C}\\) & SNLI (5\\%) & SciTail (10\\%) \\\\ \\hline \\multirow{4}{*}{\n\\begin{tabular}{l} \\(\\mathbb{D}\\) \\\\ + PPDB \\\\ + SICK \\\\ + WordNet \\\\ + HAND \\\\ + all \\\\ \\end{tabular} } & 69.18 & 60.84 & 60.84 & \\\\ \\(\\mathbb{72.81}\\)**(+3.6\\%)** & 65.52 (+4.6\\%) & 65.52 (+4.6\\%) \\\\ \\(\\mathbb{71.32}\\)**(+2.1\\%)** & 67.49 (+6.5\\%) & 67.49 (+6.5\\%) \\\\ \\(\\mathbb{71.54}\\)**(+2.3\\%)** & 64.67 (+3.8\\%) & 64.67 (+3.8\\%) \\\\ \\(\\mathbb{71.15}\\)**(+1.9\\%)** & **69.05 (+8.2\\%)** \\\\ \\(\\mathbb{71.15}\\)**(+1.2\\%)** & **64.16 (+3.3\\%)** \\\\ \\(\\mathbb{71.21}\\)**(+2.0\\%)** & 67.49 (+6.6\\%) \\\\ \\(\\mathbb{71.76}\\)**(+2.6\\%)** & 68.95 (+8.1\\%) \\\\ \\(\\mathbb{71.72}\\)**(+2.5\\%)** & - \\\\ \\(\\mathbb{71.72}\\)**(+2.8\\%)** & **70.77 (+9.9\\%)** \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 5: Test accuracies across various rules \\(\\mathcal{R}\\) and classes \\(\\mathcal{C}\\). Since SciTail has two classes, we only report results on two classes of \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{s2s}}\\)ple negation examples introduce _neutral_ examples with high lexical overlap, forcing the model to find a more informative signal.\n\nOn the other hand, using all classes for \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{s2s}}\\) results in the best performance, supporting the effectiveness of the GAN framework for penalizing or rewarding generated sentences based on \\(\\mathbb{D}\\)'s loss. Preferential selection of rules within the GAN framework remains a promising direction.\n\n### Qualitative Results\n\nTable 6 shows examples generated by various methods in AdvEntwRe. As shown, both seq2seq and rule based generators produce reasonable sentences according to classes and rules. As expected, seq2seq models trained on very few examples generate noisy sentences. The quality of our knowledge-guided generators, on the other hand, does not depend on the training set size and they still produce reliable sentences.\n\n### Case Study: Negation\n\nFor further analysis of the negation-based generator in Table 1, we collect only the negation examples in test set of SNLI, henceforth referred to as nega-SNLI. Specifically, we extract examples where either the premise or the hypothesis contains \"not\", \"no\", \"never\", or a word that ends with \"n't'. These do not cover more subtle ways of expressing negation such as \"seldom\" and the use of antonyms. nega-SNLI contains 201 examples with the following label distribution: 51 (25.4%) neutral, 42 (20.9%) entails, 108 (53.7%) contradicts. Table 7 shows examples in each category.\n\nWhile \\(\\mathbb{D}\\) achieves an accuracy of only 76.64%6 on nega-SNLI, \\(\\mathbb{D}\\) + \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{H}}\\) with negaite is substantially more successful (+6.1%) at handling negation, achieving an accuracy of 82.74%.\n\nFootnote 6: This is much less than the full test accuracy of 84.52%.\n\n## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe introduced an adversarial training architecture for textual entailment. Our seq2seq and knowledge-guided example generators, trained in an end-to-end fashion, can be used to make any base entailment model more robust. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by the significant improvement it achieves on both SNLI and SciTail, especially in the low to medium data regimes. Our rule-based generators can be expanded to cover more patterns and phenomena, and the seq2seq generator extended to incorporate per-example loss for adversarial training.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l|l} \\hline \\hline\n**P** & a person on a horse jumps over a broken down airplane \\\\ \\cline{2-2} \\multirow{2}{*}{**H\u2019**: \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{s2s}}_{c=\\mathbb{L}}\\)} & a person is on a horse jumps over a rail, a person jumping over a plane \\\\ \\cline{2-2} \\multirow{2}{*}{**H\u2019**: \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{s2s}}_{c=\\mathbb{A}}\\)} & a person is riding a horse in a field with a dog in a red coat \\\\ \\cline{2-2} \\multirow{2}{*}{**H\u2019**: \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{s2s}}_{c=\\mathbb{R}}\\)} & a person is in a blue dog is in a park \\\\ \\hline\n**P** (or \\(\\mathbf{H}\\)) & a dirt bike rider catches some air going off a large hill \\\\ \\cline{2-2} \\multirow{2}{*}{**P\u2019**: \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{KB(PDB)}}_{\\rho=s,g=\\mathbb{L}}\\)} & a dirt **motorcycle** rider catches some air going off a large hill \\\\ \\cline{2-2} \\multirow{2}{*}{**P\u2019**: \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{KB(SICK)}}_{\\rho=s,g=\\mathbb{L}}\\)} & a dirt bike **man on yellow bike** catches some air going off a large hill \\\\ \\cline{2-2} \\multirow{2}{*}{**P\u2019**: \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{KB(WordNet)}}_{\\rho=smo,g=\\mathbb{L}}\\)} & a dirt bike rider catches some **atmosphere** going off a large hill \\\\ \\cline{2-2} \\multirow{2}{*}{**P\u2019**: \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{Hand}}_{\\rho=smo,g=\\mathbb{L},\\lambda}\\)} & a dirt bike rider **do not catch** some air going off a large hill \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 6: Given a premise **P** (underlined), examples of hypothesis sentences **H\u2019** generated by seq2seq generators \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{s2s}}\\), and premise sentences **P\u2019** generated by rule based generators \\(\\mathbb{G}^{\\text{rule}}\\), on the full SNLI data.

Since SciTail (27K) is much smaller than SNLI (570K), SciTail fluctuates a lot at smaller sub-samples while SNLI converges with just 50% of the examples.\n\n## Appendix C Effectiveness of Z/X Ratio, \\(\\alpha\\)\n\nFigure 4 shows train/test accuracies with different balancing ratio between \\(z\\) and \\(x\\).

The solid red shows test accuracies with different balancing ratio, \\(\\alpha\\) (x-axis) from 0.5, 1.0,... 3.0 from \\(|z|=\\alpha*|x|\\) where \\(|x|\\) is fixed as batch size.

AVEs are carefully crafted inputs that are designed to deceive or mislead NLP models, leading to incorrect predictions or misclassifications [REF0]. These examples are created by making subtle modifications to the original input, such as adding or removing words, changing word order, or replacing words with synonyms or semantically similar words [REF3] [REF8].\n\nOne application of AVEs is in the evaluation of sentence similarity and paraphrase identification models. Traditional models often rely heavily on lexical resources and word overlap, leading to high accuracy on standard datasets but poor performance on AVEs [REF9]. To address this limitation, researchers have proposed the use of AVEs to train and evaluate models that can learn finer structural sensitivity and improve their performance on challenging examples [REF7]. By incorporating AVEs into the training process, models can be exposed to a wider range of sentence variations and improve their ability to distinguish between paraphrases and non-paraphrases [REF8].\n\nAnother application of AVEs is in the evaluation of model robustness against adversarial attacks. Adversarial attacks aim to exploit vulnerabilities in NLP models by introducing carefully crafted inputs that can cause the model to make incorrect predictions or misclassify inputs [REF4]. By using AVEs, researchers can assess the robustness of NLP models against such attacks and develop strategies to enhance model resilience [REF4]. For example, robust training techniques, such as certified robustness training and data augmentation, have been proposed to improve model performance and robustness against adversarial attacks [REF4] [REF5].\n\nAVEs have also been used to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art models, such as BERT, on challenging datasets. It has been observed that the performance changes of these models are more drastic on datasets with AVEs compared to standard datasets [REF0]. For instance, the absolute difference in performance between BiLSTM and BERT models on a standard dataset is significantly smaller compared to the difference on a dataset with AVEs [REF0]. This highlights the importance of evaluating models on AVEs to gain a better understanding of their limitations and potential vulnerabilities.\n\nIn order to construct AVEs, various techniques have been employed. These include sentence swapping, back translation, and manual verification [REF1] [REF8]. Sentence swapping involves replacing words or phrases in a sentence with their replacements, which can lead to the generation of useful AVEs [REF3]. Back translation, on the other hand, involves translating a sentence to another language and then translating it back to the original language, resulting in diverse paraphrases with high lexical overlap [REF8]. Manual verification is often performed to ensure the correctness and quality of the automatically constructed AVEs [REF1].\n\nIn conclusion, AVEs have emerged as a valuable tool for evaluating the robustness and generalization capabilities of NLP models. They have been applied in various contexts, including sentence similarity and paraphrase identification, model robustness evaluation, and performance assessment of state-of-the-art models. By incorporating AVEs into the training and evaluation process, researchers can enhance the performance and resilience of NLP models, leading to more reliable and accurate results in real-world applications.", "references_sent_to_gpt": [{"title": "PAWS: Paraphrase adversaries from word scrambling", "bibref": "BIBREF90", "authors": [{"first": "Yuan", "middle": [], "last": "Zhang", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Jason", "middle": [], "last": "Baldridge", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Luheng", "middle": [], "last": "He", "suffix": ""}], "chunk": "PAWS: Paraphrase adversaries from word scrambling [SEP] Gains are much larger on state-of-the-art\nmodels like BERT, while the BOW model learns\nalmost nothing from new examples.\n As a consequence, performance changes are more drastic\non PAWSQQP than on QQP.

These examples are crucial for understanding the vulnerabilities of NLP systems and for improving their robustness. In the context of data augmentation, AVEs serve as a means to enhance the model's ability to generalize and to defend against malicious inputs.\n\nOne approach to generating AVEs is through the use of sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, which can produce hypothesis sentences that differ in subtle but significant ways from the original premise sentences. For instance, in the SciTail dataset, simple paraphrasing techniques showed limited gains, but more sophisticated seq2seq generators were able to create adversarial examples that forced models to rely on more than just word overlap [REF0]. This is particularly important as models trained on datasets with high lexical overlap, such as SciTail, may not learn to distinguish between nuanced differences in meaning, leading to over-reliance on superficial features.\n\nRobust training methods have been shown to outperform data augmentation when it comes to defending against perturbations in datasets like IMDB and SNLI. For example, models trained with Interval Bound Propagation (IBP) demonstrated higher robustness to adversarial attacks compared to those trained with traditional data augmentation techniques [REF1]. This suggests that while data augmentation can improve model robustness to some extent, certifiably robust training methods may offer a more effective defense against AVEs.\n\nThe impact of AVEs is not uniform across different models and datasets. For instance, state-of-the-art models like BERT showed significant gains when trained with adversarial examples from the PAWS dataset, whereas simpler models like Bag-of-Words (BOW) learned almost nothing from these examples [REF2]. This indicates that the complexity and expressiveness of the model play a role in its ability to benefit from adversarial training.\n\nThe creation of adversarial datasets often involves techniques such as back translation and word scrambling, which can introduce high lexical overlap while altering the meaning of sentences [REF3]. This is essential for creating challenging examples that test a model's understanding of word order and semantics. For example, the PAWS dataset was designed to probe models' ability to go beyond recognizing overall sentence similarity and to capture finer structural sensitivities [REF6].\n\nMoreover, manual verification processes, such as those employed in the construction of adversarial datasets, ensure the quality of AVEs by involving human judgment to assess the correctness of automatically generated examples [REF8]. This step is critical to maintain the integrity of the dataset and to provide models with reliable adversarial examples for training.\n\nIn conclusion, AVEs are a powerful tool for enhancing the robustness of NLP models.

The Quora Question Pairs (QQP) corpus contains 400k real world pairs, but its negative\nexamples are drawn primarily from related questions. Few have high word overlap, and of the\n\u223c1,000 pairs with the same BOW, only 20% are\nnot paraphrases.\n This provides insufficient representative examples to evaluate models\u2019 performance on this problem, and there are too few examples for models to learn the importance of word\norder.
